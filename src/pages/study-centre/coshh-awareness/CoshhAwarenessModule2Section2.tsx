    question:
      "Under Regulation 6 of the COSHH Regulations 2002, when must an employer carry out a COSHH risk assessment?",
    options: [
      "Only after a worker has reported ill health",
      "Before any work begins that is liable to expose employees to hazardous substances",
      "Only when the HSE requests one during an inspection",
      "Once a year, during the annual health and safety review",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "Regulation 6 requires the employer to carry out a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risk to health created by work which is liable to expose employees to hazardous substances BEFORE that work begins. The assessment must be in place before exposure occurs — it is not a reactive measure.",
  },
  {
    id: "competent-person",
    question:
      "Who should carry out a COSHH risk assessment?",
    options: [
      "Only a qualified chemist or occupational hygienist",
      "Any employee who happens to be available on the day",
      "A competent person with sufficient training, knowledge, and experience of the work and the substances involved",
      "The HSE inspector assigned to the workplace",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      "The assessment must be carried out by a competent person — someone with sufficient training, knowledge, and experience to understand the hazards, evaluate the risks, and decide on appropriate control measures. This could be the employer, a supervisor, a safety officer, or an external specialist, provided they have the right competence for the specific assessment.",
  },
  {
    id: "review-triggers",
    question:
      "Which of the following would NOT normally trigger a review of an existing COSHH assessment?",
    options: [
      "A change from one brand of PVC cement to another with different ingredients",
      "An employee changing their work boots to a different colour",
      "A near miss involving solvent fumes in an enclosed space",
      "New HSE guidance on workplace exposure limits for a substance in use",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "A COSHH assessment must be reviewed when there is a significant change in work practices, substances, or processes; when new health and safety information becomes available; when an incident or near miss occurs; or routinely (annual review is good practice). An employee changing the colour of their work boots does not affect substance exposure and would not trigger a review.",
  },
];

const faqs = [
  {
    question:
      "Can I use a generic COSHH assessment for all my electrical work?",
    answer:
      "Generic assessments can be a useful starting point, but they must be adapted to reflect the specific conditions of each task and workplace. A generic assessment for 'PVC solvent cement use' might cover the substance hazards, but you still need to consider the specific location (confined space vs open air), duration of exposure, ventilation available, and whether other workers are nearby. The HSE accepts generic assessments only where the work and conditions are genuinely similar. If the conditions differ significantly, a task-specific assessment is needed.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between a COSHH assessment and a general risk assessment?",
    answer:
      "A general risk assessment under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 covers all workplace hazards — slips, trips, falls, manual handling, electrical safety, and so on. A COSHH assessment is a specific, detailed assessment focused solely on the risks to health from hazardous substances. It requires you to consider the nature of each substance, the route of exposure (inhalation, skin contact, ingestion), the duration and frequency of exposure, workplace exposure limits, and specific control measures for chemical hazards. Both are legal requirements and complement each other.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do I need a COSHH assessment for every single substance on site?",
    answer:
      "You need a COSHH assessment for every hazardous substance that workers are liable to be exposed to during their work. This includes substances you use directly (adhesives, solvents, cleaning agents), substances generated by your work (fumes from soldering, dust from cutting), and substances already present in the workplace (asbestos, lead paint). You do not need a separate assessment for substances that are not hazardous or that workers will never come into contact with. Where multiple substances pose similar risks and are used in similar conditions, a single assessment may cover them — but the reasoning must be documented.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long should I keep COSHH assessment records?",
    answer:
      "COSHH assessments should be kept for as long as they are relevant, plus a reasonable period afterwards. Where health surveillance records are involved (Regulation 11), individual health records must be kept for at least 40 years from the date of the last entry. For routine COSHH assessments without health surveillance, the HSE recommends keeping records for a minimum of 5 years. Many employers keep them indefinitely as part of their health and safety management system. Electronic records are perfectly acceptable provided they are secure, backed up, and accessible when needed.",

const quizQuestions = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question:
      "What standard must a COSHH risk assessment meet under Regulation 6?",
    options: [
      "It must be approved by the HSE before work begins",
      "It must be 'suitable and sufficient'",
      "It must be signed by a NEBOSH-qualified person",
      "It must be reviewed by an occupational hygienist",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Regulation 6 requires the assessment to be 'suitable and sufficient' — meaning it must be appropriate for the work being assessed, cover all significant risks, identify who is at risk and how, and lead to practical decisions about control measures. It does not need HSE pre-approval or a specific qualification, although competence is required.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question:
      "What is the FIRST step in a COSHH risk assessment?",
    options: [
      "Decide what PPE is needed",
      "Gather information about the substances, the work, and the working practices",
      "Record the assessment findings",
      "Monitor employee exposure levels",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The first step is always to gather information — identify what hazardous substances are present or will be used, understand the work being done, and review how substances are handled. Without this foundation, the rest of the assessment cannot be carried out properly.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question:
      "Which of the following is the MOST important source of substance hazard information for a COSHH assessment?",
    options: [
      "The product label only",
      "Advice from colleagues who have used the substance before",
      "The Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the manufacturer or supplier",
      "A general internet search about the substance",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "The Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is the primary and most authoritative source of hazard information. It provides detailed information across 16 standardised sections covering hazard identification, composition, first-aid measures, handling and storage, exposure controls, toxicological information, and more. Suppliers are legally required to provide an SDS for hazardous substances.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question:
      "An electrician uses PVC solvent cement for 20 minutes in a well-ventilated plant room. A colleague uses the same product for 4 hours in a small, unventilated cupboard. Can the same COSHH assessment cover both tasks?",
    options: [
      "Yes — the substance is the same, so one assessment covers all uses",
      "No — the exposure conditions are significantly different, so separate assessments (or separate sections within the same assessment) are needed",
      "Yes — generic assessments always cover all situations",
      "No — COSHH assessments cannot cover the same substance used in different locations",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Although the substance is the same, the risk to health is significantly different because the duration of exposure and the ventilation conditions differ substantially. The 4-hour task in an unventilated cupboard presents a much higher risk than the 20-minute task in a ventilated room. Either separate assessments or separate sections within the same assessment are needed to address the different exposure scenarios and their respective control measures.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question:
      "What does EH40 provide?",
    options: [
      "A list of approved PPE manufacturers",
      "Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs) for hazardous substances",
      "COSHH assessment templates for download",
      "Training requirements for COSHH assessors",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "EH40 is the HSE publication 'Workplace Exposure Limits' — it lists the workplace exposure limits (WELs) for hundreds of hazardous substances. WELs are the maximum concentrations of airborne substances that workers may be exposed to over specified reference periods (usually 8-hour TWA and 15-minute STEL). It is an essential reference document for anyone carrying out COSHH assessments.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question:
      "When recording a COSHH assessment, which of the following must be included?",
    options: [
      "Only the name of the substance and the date of the assessment",
      "The significant findings, the groups of employees at risk, and the steps taken to prevent or adequately control exposure",
      "A photograph of the substance packaging only",
      "The name and qualifications of every employee in the building",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The recorded assessment must include the significant findings of the assessment (hazards identified, who is at risk, the nature and degree of exposure), the steps taken or to be taken to prevent or control exposure, and enough detail for another competent person to understand the reasoning. Recording requirements are set out in Regulation 6(4).",

    question:
      "Which HSE tool helps small businesses carry out COSHH assessments without specialist knowledge?",
    options: [
      "EH40",
      "COSHH Essentials",
      "The Asbestos Register",
      "RIDDOR Online Reporting",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "COSHH Essentials is a free, web-based tool provided by the HSE. It uses a simple step-by-step approach — asking about the substance, the task, and the conditions — to generate guidance on the level of control needed. It is designed for small and medium-sized businesses that may not have access to specialist occupational hygiene advice, though it should not replace a full assessment for complex or high-risk work.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question:
      "A COSHH assessment for flux fumes during soldering was last reviewed 14 months ago. No changes have occurred in the work, the substance, or the workplace. Is the assessment still valid?",
    options: [
      "No — all COSHH assessments expire after exactly 12 months",
      "Yes — there is no fixed expiry period, but the employer should review it soon as annual review is good practice",
      "No — COSHH assessments must be renewed every 6 months",
      "Yes — COSHH assessments never need reviewing unless the HSE requests it",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "There is no fixed statutory expiry period for COSHH assessments. An assessment remains valid as long as the work, substances, and conditions have not changed and no new information has become available. However, annual review is widely regarded as good practice. At 14 months without review, the assessment is not automatically invalid, but the employer should arrange a review promptly to confirm it is still current.",
