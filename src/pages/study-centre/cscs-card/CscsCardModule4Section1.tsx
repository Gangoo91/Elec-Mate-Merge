    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation:
      "Asbestos is excluded from COSHH because it has its own dedicated legislation \u2014 the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (CAR 2012). COSHH covers a very wide range of hazardous substances including chemicals, fumes, dusts, vapours, mists, gases, and biological agents, but substances already controlled under their own specific regulations (asbestos, lead, and radioactive materials) are excluded from COSHH to avoid duplication."

      "Under the UK REACH Regulations and CLP Regulation, a Safety Data Sheet must contain exactly 16 sections in a prescribed order. These cover identification, hazards, composition, first-aid measures, firefighting, accidental release, handling and storage, exposure controls/PPE, physical and chemical properties, stability and reactivity, toxicological information, ecological information, disposal, transport, regulatory information, and other information. The format is internationally standardised under the Globally Harmonised System (GHS)."

    question: "What does an 8-hour TWA Workplace Exposure Limit (WEL) represent?",
    options: [
      "The maximum concentration of a substance permitted at any single moment during a shift",
      "The average concentration of a substance over an 8-hour working day to which a worker may be exposed",
      "The total cumulative dose of a substance permitted over an 8-hour period",
      "The concentration at which emergency procedures must be activated"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation:
      "An 8-hour TWA (Time-Weighted Average) Workplace Exposure Limit is the average concentration of an airborne substance over an 8-hour working day (a normal shift) to which a worker may be exposed by inhalation. It is calculated as a time-weighted average, meaning brief exposures above the limit may be acceptable provided the average over the full 8-hour period remains at or below the WEL. For substances with short-term dangers, a separate 15-minute STEL (Short-Term Exposure Limit) may also apply."

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the difference between COSHH and DSEAR?",
    answer:
      "COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002) deals with protecting workers from health effects caused by exposure to hazardous substances \u2014 for example, respiratory disease from inhaling silica dust, dermatitis from skin contact with cement, or cancer from exposure to certain chemicals. DSEAR (Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002) deals with protecting workers from fire, explosion, and similar energy-releasing events caused by dangerous substances and potentially explosive atmospheres. There is some overlap \u2014 a flammable solvent may be subject to both COSHH (for its toxic health effects if inhaled) and DSEAR (for its fire and explosion risk). In practice, a thorough risk assessment considers both sets of regulations. On construction sites, many substances require assessment under both COSHH and DSEAR."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a separate COSHH assessment for every single product I use?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. The HSE guidance permits \u2018generic\u2019 or \u2018grouped\u2019 COSHH assessments where the hazards, exposure patterns, and controls are substantially similar. For example, if a site uses several different brands of PVA adhesive that all contain the same active hazardous ingredients at similar concentrations and are used in the same way, a single COSHH assessment covering \u2018PVA adhesives\u2019 may be adequate. However, each assessment must be specific enough to identify the actual hazards, exposure routes, and required controls. If products differ significantly in their hazards or require different controls, they need separate assessments. In practice, most construction sites maintain a COSHH register listing every hazardous substance on site with a corresponding assessment for each or each group."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if I cannot find the Safety Data Sheet for a product?",
    answer:
      "Your employer has a legal duty under the COSHH Regulations to obtain Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous substances used in the workplace. Suppliers and manufacturers are legally required under the UK REACH Regulations and CLP Regulation to provide SDS documents free of charge for classified hazardous substances. If you cannot find the SDS, you should first check whether your site or company maintains a central COSHH file or register \u2014 the SDS should be kept there. If it is not available, ask your supervisor or health and safety manager to obtain it from the supplier. Most manufacturers also publish SDS documents on their websites. You must not use a hazardous substance if the SDS is unavailable, as you cannot carry out a proper COSHH assessment without knowing the hazards, exposure controls, and first-aid measures."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I refuse to work with a hazardous substance if I have not had COSHH training?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Under the COSHH Regulations, your employer must provide adequate information, instruction, and training before you work with hazardous substances. Under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, you have a right to refuse to carry out work that you reasonably believe poses a serious and imminent danger to your health. If you have not received training on the specific hazards, controls, and emergency procedures for a substance, you are entitled to raise this with your supervisor and request proper training before proceeding. You should also contact your safety representative or trade union representative if the matter is not resolved. Employers who require workers to use hazardous substances without providing adequate COSHH training are in breach of their legal duties."

    question:
      "What do the COSHH Regulations 2002 require employers to do?",
    options: [
      "Eliminate all hazardous substances from the workplace",
      "Assess and control exposure to hazardous substances to prevent ill health",
      "Provide every employee with a respirator regardless of the task",
      "Report every use of a hazardous substance to the HSE"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The COSHH Regulations 2002 require employers to assess the risks from hazardous substances in the workplace and to prevent or adequately control exposure to protect workers\u2019 health. The regulations do not require the elimination of all hazardous substances (which is often not reasonably practicable), but they do require that exposure is either prevented entirely or controlled to a level that does not cause harm. This follows a hierarchy of control measures."

    question:
      "Which GHS/CLP pictogram features a skull and crossbones symbol?",
    options: [
      "The pictogram for corrosive substances",
      "The pictogram for acutely toxic substances (fatal or toxic if swallowed, inhaled, or in contact with skin)",
      "The pictogram for substances hazardous to the aquatic environment",
      "The pictogram for oxidising substances"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The skull and crossbones pictogram (GHS06) indicates acute toxicity \u2014 substances that are fatal or toxic if swallowed, inhaled, or in contact with skin. This is one of the most serious hazard pictograms. Examples include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, and certain pesticide concentrates. Products bearing this pictogram require the strictest controls, including specific PPE, restricted access, and detailed emergency procedures."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question:
      "What is the correct order of the hierarchy of control for hazardous substance exposure under COSHH?",
    options: [
      "PPE, administrative controls, engineering controls, substitution, elimination",
      "Elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, PPE",
      "Substitution, elimination, PPE, engineering controls, administrative controls",
      "Engineering controls, elimination, substitution, PPE, administrative controls"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "The hierarchy of control under COSHH follows the same principle as the general hierarchy of risk control: elimination (remove the substance entirely), substitution (replace with a less hazardous alternative), engineering controls (LEV, ventilation, enclosed systems), administrative controls (procedures, rotation, training), and PPE (respiratory protection, gloves, goggles) as the last resort. This hierarchy is fundamental to COSHH compliance and must be applied in order, with PPE used only when higher-level controls are not reasonably practicable."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question:
      "Which section of a Safety Data Sheet provides information on recommended PPE and exposure controls?",
    options: [

      "Section 4: First-Aid Measures",
      "Section 7: Handling and Storage",
      "Section 8: Exposure Controls / Personal Protection"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      "Section 8 of a Safety Data Sheet covers Exposure Controls / Personal Protection. This section provides information on applicable Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs), recommended engineering controls (such as ventilation requirements), and the specific types of personal protective equipment recommended for safe handling \u2014 including respiratory protection, hand protection (specifying glove material and breakthrough time), eye/face protection, and skin/body protection. This section is essential for writing COSHH assessments and selecting appropriate PPE."

    question:
      "What is the most common route of exposure to hazardous substances on construction sites?",
    options: [
      "Ingestion (swallowing)",
      "Injection through the skin",
      "Inhalation (breathing in)",
      "Absorption through the eyes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Inhalation is the most common and often the most significant route of exposure to hazardous substances on construction sites. Activities such as cutting, grinding, drilling, sanding, mixing, and spraying generate airborne dusts, fumes, mists, and vapours that are readily inhaled. The lungs have an enormous surface area and a rich blood supply, meaning inhaled substances are rapidly absorbed into the body. This is why respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and engineering controls such as local exhaust ventilation (LEV) and water suppression are critical on construction sites."

    question:
      "Prolonged skin contact with wet cement can cause which of the following conditions?",
    options: [
      "Occupational asthma and rhinitis",
      "Silicosis and pleural thickening",
      "Cement burns (alkaline burns) and cement dermatitis",
      "Hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "Wet cement is highly alkaline (pH 12\u201314) due to the calcium hydroxide formed when cement powder reacts with water. Prolonged skin contact can cause two distinct conditions: cement burns (chemical burns from the alkaline pH, which can be severe and deep, sometimes requiring skin grafts) and cement dermatitis (allergic contact dermatitis caused by the hexavalent chromium content, leading to chronic skin inflammation, cracking, and blistering). Both conditions are entirely preventable through the use of waterproof gloves, barrier creams, and prompt washing of any cement from the skin."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question:
      "When is health surveillance required under the COSHH Regulations?",
    options: [
      "For every worker who has ever been in the same building as a hazardous substance",
      "Only for workers who have already developed symptoms of ill health",
      "When there is a reasonable likelihood that an identifiable disease or adverse health effect may result from exposure, despite controls",
      "Only when a worker requests it in writing"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      "The COSHH Regulations require health surveillance when there is a reasonable likelihood that an identifiable disease or adverse health effect may occur as a result of exposure, and there are valid techniques available to detect the disease or effect. Health surveillance is a proactive measure \u2014 it is designed to detect early signs of ill health before the condition becomes irreversible or disabling. Examples include lung function testing for workers exposed to respiratory sensitisers, skin checks for workers exposed to dermatitis-causing substances, and blood lead level monitoring for workers exposed to lead."

  {
    id: 8,
    question:
      "What is the PRIMARY purpose of storing hazardous substances in ventilated cabinets with appropriate signage?",
    options: [
      "To reduce the cost of purchasing hazardous substances",
      "To prevent the build-up of hazardous vapours and ensure workers are aware of the hazards present",
      "To comply with environmental protection requirements only",
      "To make it easier for the fire brigade to locate the substances in an emergency"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      "Storing hazardous substances in ventilated cabinets serves two primary purposes: preventing the accumulation of hazardous vapours (many substances release vapours even when containers are closed, and vapour accumulation in an unventilated space can create both health hazards and fire/explosion risks) and ensuring that appropriate hazard signage clearly communicates the nature of the substances stored to anyone who may need to access the area. This is a requirement under both the COSHH Regulations and DSEAR."

              <p>
                <strong>COSHH</strong> stands for the <strong>Control of Substances Hazardous to Health</strong>.
                The COSHH Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/2677) are the principal set of regulations in the United
                Kingdom that require employers to assess and control the risks to workers&rsquo; health arising
                from exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace. The regulations are made under the
                Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and are enforced by the Health and Safety Executive
                (HSE).
              </p>

              <p>
                COSHH covers a very wide range of substances that can cause harm to health. The regulations
                apply to any substance that is classified as hazardous under the CLP Regulation (Classification,
                Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures), as well as other substances that may cause
                harm through workplace exposure even if not formally classified. The types of substances covered
                include:

                <p className="text-sm text-white/80">
                  The original COSHH Regulations were introduced in 1988 and have been amended several times
                  since, with the current consolidated version being the COSHH Regulations 2002 (as amended).
                  Before COSHH, there was no comprehensive framework requiring employers to assess and control
                  exposure to hazardous substances. The regulations were introduced in response to growing
                  evidence of occupational diseases caused by workplace chemical exposure, including cancers,
                  respiratory diseases, and skin conditions. Today, COSHH is one of the most important sets
                  of health and safety regulations in the UK, applying to virtually every workplace where
                  hazardous substances are used, produced, or encountered.

              Hazardous Substance Classification
            </h2>
            <div className="text-white space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                Hazardous substances in the United Kingdom are classified and labelled under the <strong>CLP
                Regulation</strong> (Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures),
                which implements the <strong>Globally Harmonised System (GHS)</strong> of classification and
                labelling of chemicals. The GHS was developed by the United Nations to create a single,
                internationally consistent system for communicating chemical hazards, replacing the many
                different national systems that previously existed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Under the CLP Regulation, hazardous substances and mixtures must be labelled with standardised
                <strong> hazard pictograms</strong> &mdash; red-bordered diamond-shaped symbols on a white
                background, each containing a black symbol that indicates the nature of the hazard. There are
                <strong> nine GHS hazard pictograms</strong> in total. Every worker on a construction site
                should be able to recognise all nine and understand what each represents.

              COSHH Assessment

              <p>
                The cornerstone of the COSHH Regulations is the requirement for a <strong>suitable and
                sufficient assessment</strong> of the risks to health from hazardous substances. The COSHH
                assessment is not a one-off exercise &mdash; it must be reviewed regularly (the HSE recommends
                at least annually) and whenever there is reason to believe it may no longer be valid, such as
                when substances change, work methods change, or new information about health effects becomes
                available.
              </p>

              <p>
                The HSE provides an eight-step process for conducting a COSHH assessment. This structured
                approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered and that the assessment is
                comprehensive and practical:

                  Before completing the assessment, the assessor must review the SDS for every hazardous
                  substance included. The SDS provides essential information on the substance&rsquo;s hazards,
                  recommended exposure controls, PPE requirements, first-aid measures, and emergency response
                  procedures. Without the SDS, a proper COSHH assessment cannot be conducted.

              <p>
                A <strong>Safety Data Sheet (SDS)</strong> is a standardised document that provides detailed
                information about a hazardous substance or mixture. Under the UK REACH Regulations, suppliers
                and manufacturers of hazardous substances are legally required to provide an SDS to downstream
                users (i.e. the businesses and workers who use their products). The SDS must be provided free
                of charge, in English, and must be kept up to date.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every SDS follows a <strong>standardised 16-section format</strong> prescribed by the Globally
                Harmonised System (GHS). This consistent format means that once you know how to read one SDS,
                you can read any SDS regardless of the product or manufacturer. The 16 sections are:

                  usually located in the site office, welfare facility, or with the site safety officer. Many
                  sites now use electronic COSHH management systems where SDS documents can be accessed on

              <p>
                The COSHH Regulations require employers to either <strong>prevent exposure</strong> to
                hazardous substances or, where prevention is not reasonably practicable, <strong>adequately
                control exposure</strong>. The regulations specify a <strong>hierarchy of control
                measures</strong> that must be applied in order, starting with the most effective measures
                and moving to less effective measures only when higher-level controls are not reasonably
                practicable.

                      Remove the hazardous substance entirely from the process. This is the most effective
                      control because it eliminates the hazard completely. For example, using mechanical
                      fixings instead of solvent-based adhesives, using pre-cut materials instead of cutting
                      on site (which generates dust), or using a different construction method that does
                      not require the hazardous substance at all.

                  caused by hazardous substances in construction take years or decades to develop. By the
                  time symptoms appear, irreversible damage has often already occurred. This is why
                  prevention and control of exposure &mdash; not just treatment of symptoms &mdash; is
                  the focus of the COSHH Regulations. The diseases caused by silica dust, wood dust,
                  isocyanates, and many other construction substances are entirely preventable if exposure
                  is properly controlled.

                The safe storage, correct disposal, and effective emergency response for hazardous substances
                are critical components of COSHH compliance. Poor storage can lead to accidental mixing of
                incompatible chemicals, release of toxic vapours, fire, or explosion. Incorrect disposal can
                cause environmental contamination and legal prosecution. Inadequate emergency procedures can

                  and effective emergency response are not optional extras &mdash; they are legal
                  requirements under COSHH and related environmental legislation. Every worker on site
                  should know where hazardous substances are stored, how they should be disposed of,
                  where the spill kit is located, where the nearest eye wash station is, and what to do
                  in an emergency. This information must be covered in the site induction and reinforced
                  through regular toolbox talks and training.
