    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Cyril Northcote Parkinson formulated Parkinson\'s Law in 1955, stating that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion". This fundamental principle underpins many modern time management techniques.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'Parkinson\'s Law states that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion". Setting tighter deadlines can actually increase productivity by preventing unnecessary expansion of tasks.',

      'Plans always fail without backup options',
      'Planning takes too much time',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'The planning fallacy is our systematic tendency to underestimate how long tasks will take, even when we have past experience of similar tasks taking longer. This was identified by psychologists Kahneman and Tversky in 1979.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Stephen Covey popularised the Eisenhower Matrix in "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" (1989), though the principle was attributed to President Eisenhower. Covey\'s framework helps distinguish between urgent and important tasks.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:

    explanation:
      "Vilfredo Pareto identified in 1896 that 80% of Italy's wealth belonged to 20% of the population. This principle has been widely applied to time management, showing that 80% of results often come from 20% of efforts.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation:
      'You should identify 1-3 MITs per day. This keeps focus manageable while allowing for different priorities. Too many "important" tasks dilutes focus; too few may not reflect the reality of a busy workday.',

    options: ['Daily planning', 'Weekly planning', 'Monthly planning', 'Yearly planning'],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Weekly planning is more strategic than daily planning, allowing you to review goals, schedule Big Rocks, and balance work across the week. Daily planning then focuses on execution of the weekly plan.',

      'It takes less time overall',
      'It allows you to see the bigger picture and schedule important non-urgent tasks',
      'It eliminates the need for daily planning',
      'It reduces stress by planning less frequently',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Weekly planning allows you to see the bigger picture, schedule Quadrant 2 activities (important but not urgent), and proactively allocate time for priorities. Daily planning alone tends to be reactive and focused on urgencies.',

      'Switching from work to personal time',
      'Using different tools for different jobs',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Context switching is changing between different types of tasks or mental modes (e.g., from paperwork to physical work, or from one client to another). Each switch carries a cognitive cost and recovery time.',

      'It wastes travel time',
      'Your brain needs time to refocus on the new task, losing momentum',
      'It requires different tools each time',
      'It causes physical fatigue',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Context switching is costly because your brain needs time to let go of the previous task and refocus on the new one. This "attention residue" and refocusing time can consume significant productivity across a day.',

      'Always saying yes to safety procedures',
      'Being too optimistic about job completion times',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'The "yes to everything" trap is accepting all work requests without considering capacity, leading to overcommitment, missed deadlines, rushed work, and stress. Learning to say no or "not right now" is essential for quality work.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Studies suggest tradespeople lose 3-5 hours per week to poor material planning, including supplier trips, waiting for deliveries, and work stoppages. This represents 10-15% of a working week.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
