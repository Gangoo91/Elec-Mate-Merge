    question: "What is the purpose of a trend log in a BMS?",
    options: [
      "To display current values only",
      "To record historical data for analysis and fault finding",
      "To set alarm thresholds",
      "To control equipment directly"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Trend logs record historical data points over time, enabling analysis of system performance, identification of faults, and optimisation of control strategies.",

    question: "What is an optimum start controller in HVAC?",
    options: [
      "A controller that starts equipment at fixed times",
      "A controller that calculates when to start plant to achieve setpoint at occupancy",
      "A manual override switch",
      "An emergency stop button"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Optimum start controllers calculate the latest time to start heating or cooling plant to achieve the required temperature by the start of occupancy, saving energy.",

    options: [
      "Turning all systems off at night",
      "Reducing heating/cooling setpoints during unoccupied periods",
      "Running systems at full capacity overnight",
      "Switching to emergency power at night"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Night setback reduces heating setpoints (or raises cooling setpoints) during unoccupied periods to save energy while preventing the building from getting too cold or hot.",

    options: [
      "Ventilation controlled by time schedule only",
      "Ventilation adjusted based on occupancy or air quality sensors",
      "Maximum ventilation at all times",
      "Ventilation controlled manually by occupants"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "DCV adjusts ventilation rates based on actual occupancy (typically using CO2 sensors) rather than fixed rates, significantly reducing energy consumption.",

      "800-1000 ppm",
      "2000 ppm"
