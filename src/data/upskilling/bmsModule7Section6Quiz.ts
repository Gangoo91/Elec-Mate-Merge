    question: "Why is client handover an essential stage in a BMS project?",
    options: [
      "To get final payment from the client",
      "To ensure clients can operate the system safely and effectively",
      "To demonstrate the contractor's technical skills",
      "To complete the installation paperwork"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Client handover ensures building operators can use the BMS safely and effectively, preventing misuse, reducing call-backs, and building client confidence in the system."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Give two examples of tasks covered during operator training.",
    options: [
      "Cable installation and termination procedures",
      "Acknowledging alarms and adjusting setpoints",
      "Controller programming and network setup",
      "Electrical safety and isolation procedures"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Operator training focuses on daily operational tasks like acknowledging alarms, adjusting setpoints, navigating dashboards, and generating reports - not installation or programming tasks."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Why must warranty terms be explained during handover?",
    options: [
      "To limit the contractor's liability exposure",
      "To comply with insurance requirements",
      "To ensure clients understand coverage and claim procedures",
      "To justify the project cost to the client"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Explaining warranty terms ensures clients understand what is covered, how to make claims, maintenance requirements, and support procedures, preventing disputes and ensuring proper system care."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What document records all field inputs and outputs?",
    options: [
      "As-built schematic drawings",
      "IO list (Input/Output list)",
      "Commissioning test sheets",
      "O&M (Operations and Maintenance) manual"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The IO list (Input/Output list) records all field inputs and outputs with device descriptions, locations, addresses, scaling, and alarm settings."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is an addressing register?",
    options: [
      "A list of client contact information",
      "A record of BACnet IDs, Modbus addresses, and communication settings",
      "A schedule of maintenance visits",
      "A log of system alarm events"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "An addressing register documents network communication details including BACnet IDs, Modbus addresses, KNX addresses, network topology, and protocol settings."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Why are software backups important for clients?",
    options: [
      "To allow clients to modify the system programming",
      "To provide system recovery in case of controller failure",
      "To enable remote monitoring capabilities",
      "To reduce ongoing maintenance costs"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Software backups enable system recovery if controllers fail or become corrupted, preventing lengthy downtime and expensive reprogramming from scratch."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What role do electricians play in preparing as-built drawings?",
    options: [
      "Creating the final CAD drawings for the client",
      "Providing accurate redline drawings showing installation changes",
      "Programming the BMS graphics and interfaces",
      "Writing the technical specifications"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Electricians provide accurate redline drawings marking all changes from the original design, which design engineers use to create final as-built drawings."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Why should training focus on simple, practical tasks?",
    options: [
      "To reduce the training time required",
      "To avoid overwhelming operators with technical details",
      "To limit the contractor's support obligations",
      "To minimize the risk of system damage"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Training should focus on practical daily tasks operators actually need (checking alarms, adjusting schedules, generating reports) rather than overwhelming them with technical programming details."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What could happen if documentation is incomplete at handover?",
    options: [
      "The system will stop working after a few months",
      "Future troubleshooting becomes difficult and dangerous",
      "The warranty will be automatically void",
      "Energy consumption will increase significantly"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Incomplete documentation makes future troubleshooting difficult and dangerous, increases modification costs, and can lead to client dissatisfaction and legal liability."
  },

    id: 10,
    question: "In the real-world example, why couldn't the school diagnose a fault after installation?",
    options: [
      "The BMS system was programmed incorrectly",
      "The facilities staff were not qualified electricians",
      "No updated IO list or software backups were provided",
      "The sensors were installed in the wrong locations"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "The school couldn't diagnose the fault because they had no documentation (IO lists, software backups, or as-built drawings) to identify which sensor was malfunctioning or how to access system parameters."
