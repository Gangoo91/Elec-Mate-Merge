      id: 1,
      question: "What is the primary purpose of high-risk task area lighting?",
      options: [
        "To guide people to exits during emergencies",
        "To allow safe shutdown of dangerous processes before evacuation", 
        "To provide general illumination in open areas",
        "To prevent panic in crowded spaces"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "High-risk task area lighting enables workers to safely shut down dangerous processes, machinery, or equipment before evacuating, preventing accidents and injuries."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "What is the minimum maintained lux level required for high-risk task area lighting under BS 5266?",
      options: [
        "0.5 lux",
        "5 lux",
        "15 lux",
        "50 lux"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "BS 5266 requires a minimum of 15 lux maintained illuminance for high-risk task areas, significantly higher than the 0.5 lux required for escape routes."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "High-risk task area lighting must provide what percentage of normal task illuminance?",
      options: [
        "5%",
        "10%", 
        "20%",
        "50%"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The lighting must provide at least 10% of the normal task illuminance, with a minimum of 15 lux, whichever is greater."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Which of these would NOT typically require high-risk task area lighting?",
      options: [
        "Industrial lathe operation",
        "Chemical laboratory work",
        "General office administration",
        "Welding operations"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "General office work does not involve hazardous processes or dangerous machinery that would require high-risk task area lighting."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "Why is glare reduction particularly important in high-risk task lighting?",
      options: [
        "To save energy",
        "To meet aesthetic requirements",
        "To prevent accidents during critical shutdown procedures",
        "To comply with general lighting standards"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Glare can impair vision and cause accidents when workers need to safely shutdown dangerous equipment or processes during an emergency."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "What is the typical minimum duration for emergency lighting in industrial settings?",
      options: [
        "30 minutes",
        "1 hour",
        "3 hours",
        "8 hours"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "While the minimum is 1 hour, industrial settings often require 3 hours duration to allow for complex shutdown procedures and potential rescue operations."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "What type of assessment determines the need for high-risk task lighting?",
      options: [
        "Energy audit",
        "Fire risk assessment",
        "Risk evaluation/assessment",
        "Building survey"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "A formal risk evaluation must assess where dangerous processes occur and determine the need for high-risk task area lighting."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "Why cannot anti-panic lighting substitute for high-risk task area lighting?",
      options: [
        "Anti-panic lighting is too dim for task completion",
        "They serve different purposes - movement vs task completion",
        "Anti-panic lighting covers different areas",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Anti-panic lighting (0.5 lux) is designed for safe movement through open areas, not for completing dangerous tasks which require much higher illuminance (15+ lux) and precise coverage."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: "How often should lux levels be measured in high-risk task areas?",
      options: [
        "Weekly",
        "Monthly during functional tests",
        "Annually during full duration tests",
        "Periodically as part of maintenance schedule"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Lux levels should be measured periodically (not just monthly/annually) as part of the maintenance schedule to ensure continued compliance with safety requirements."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: "Who should be consulted when planning high-risk task lighting around machinery?",
      options: [
        "Building managers only",
        "Electrical contractors only", 
        "Supervisors and machine operators",
        "Insurance companies only"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Supervisors and machine operators have essential knowledge about shutdown procedures, hazard locations, and operational requirements that inform proper lighting design."
