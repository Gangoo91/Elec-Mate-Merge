    question: "What is the phenomenon that allows light to travel through an optical fibre?",
    options: ["Refraction only", "Total internal reflection", "Diffraction", "Polarisation"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Total internal reflection occurs when light hits the core/cladding boundary at an angle greater than the critical angle, causing it to reflect back into the core rather than escaping.",
