    question: "What is the purpose of a functional emergency lighting test?",
    options: [
      "To drain the batteries completely",
      "To ensure all luminaires switch into emergency mode when mains power fails",
      "To test the wiring installation only",
      "To check the brightness of the lamps"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A functional test confirms that all luminaires switch to emergency mode during a simulated mains failure, verifying the system operates correctly."
  },

    question: "How often must functional tests be carried out?",
    options: [
      "Weekly",
      "Monthly",
      "Annually",
      "Every 6 months"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "BS 5266-1 requires short functional tests to be carried out monthly to ensure ongoing system operation."
  },

    id: 3,
    question: "How long should monthly functional tests last?",
    options: [
      "3 hours",
      "1 hour",
      "Only long enough to confirm operation (short duration)",
      "30 minutes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Monthly tests are kept deliberately short - just long enough to confirm all luminaires switch to emergency mode without draining the batteries."
  },

    question: "What is the purpose of the annual 3-hour duration test?",
    options: [
      "To comply with insurance requirements only",
      "To verify battery capacity and ensure escape routes remain illuminated for the full evacuation period",
      "To test the charging circuits",
      "To check the brightness of exit signs"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The annual 3-hour test verifies that batteries can sustain emergency lighting for the full rated period, ensuring safe evacuation in a real emergency."
  },

    question: "When must a 3-hour duration test also be completed besides annually?",
    options: [
      "Every month",
      "Only during commissioning",
      "At commissioning and after any system modifications",
      "Never - annual testing is sufficient"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "A full 3-hour duration test must be completed at commissioning, annually, and after any modifications to the emergency lighting system."

    id: 6,
    question: "What standard governs testing requirements for emergency lighting?",
    options: [
      "BS 7671",
      "BS 5266-1 and BS EN 50172",
      "BS 5839",
      "BS EN 60598"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "BS 5266-1 and BS EN 50172 are the key standards that specify testing requirements for emergency lighting systems in the UK."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Why should duration tests be scheduled outside of occupied hours?",
    options: [
      "To save electricity",
      "To avoid disturbing staff",
      "To avoid leaving the building unprotected while batteries recharge after the test",
      "It's not necessary - tests can be done anytime"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "After a 3-hour duration test, batteries need time to recharge. Testing outside occupied hours ensures the building isn't left without emergency lighting protection."
  },

    id: 8,
    question: "Give one reason why a luminaire might fail a 3-hour test.",
    options: [
      "The LED is too bright",
      "The battery is ageing and has lost capacity",
      "The charging circuit is too efficient",
      "The luminaire is too new"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Ageing batteries (typically over 3-5 years old) lose capacity and may pass short monthly tests but fail to sustain load for the full 3-hour duration."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Why must test results be recorded in the logbook?",
    options: [
      "It's optional but recommended",
      "To demonstrate compliance during fire inspections and provide evidence for insurers",
      "Only for large buildings",
      "To help the manufacturer"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The emergency lighting logbook provides documented evidence of compliance for fire inspectors and insurers, and is a legal requirement under BS 5266-1."

    question: "What happened in the Leeds care home case study?",
    options: [
      "The system worked perfectly during a fire drill",
      "Monthly tests were not carried out",
      "Lights failed after 40 minutes during a drill because batteries were over 7 years old and annual duration tests had been neglected",
      "The building had no emergency lighting"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Despite monthly functional tests, the neglected annual duration testing meant ageing batteries (over 7 years old) failed after just 40 minutes, putting vulnerable residents at risk."
