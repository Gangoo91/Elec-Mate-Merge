    question: "What is the main purpose of the client handover?",
    options: [
      "To collect final payment from the client",
      "To transfer legal responsibility for maintenance and ensure the client understands system operation",
      "To demonstrate that the system physically works",
      "To obtain insurance approval"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The main purpose of client handover is to transfer legal responsibility for ongoing testing and maintenance from the installer to the client's Responsible Person, while ensuring they fully understand system operation, maintenance requirements, and their legal obligations under the Fire Safety Order 2005. Handover marks the point where the client becomes legally responsible for compliance."

    question: "What law defines the client's responsibilities after handover?",
    options: [
      "BS 5266-1",
      "BS 7671",
      "Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005",
      "Building Regulations Part B"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 defines the client's legal responsibilities for fire safety, including emergency lighting maintenance. Under this law, the building's Responsible Person (typically the owner, landlord, or employer) must ensure regular testing, maintenance, and record-keeping. BS 5266-1 and BS 7671 provide technical standards, but the Fire Safety Order 2005 establishes legal duties."

    question: "Name three key documents that must be provided during handover.",
    options: [
      "Payment receipt, warranty card, promotional brochure",
      "Commissioning certificates, as-built drawings, emergency lighting logbook",
      "Building plans, insurance documents, fire risk assessment",
      "Contractor invoice, manufacturer catalogue, electrical meter readings"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The three essential handover documents are: (1) Commissioning certificates (BS 5266-1 Annex G) proving compliance, (2) As-built layout drawings showing luminaire positions and circuit routes, and (3) Emergency lighting logbook with initial test results and blank entries for future tests. Additional documents include electrical certificates, maintenance instructions, and training notes."

    id: 4,
    question: "What is the purpose of a handover form?",
    options: [
      "To request final payment for the installation",
      "To confirm the client has received documentation and acknowledge transfer of responsibility",
      "To schedule future maintenance visits",
      "To register the system with the fire authority"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The handover form (or handover certificate) serves as written proof that: (1) The client received all required documentation, (2) Training was provided, (3) The client acknowledges their legal responsibilities, and (4) Responsibility for maintenance has formally transferred from installer to client. Both parties must sign and retain copies for legal protection. Without this signed form, the installer may remain liable for future failures."

    id: 5,
    question: "Who signs the handover documentation?",
    options: [
      "Only the installer",
      "Only the client",
      "Both the client (or Responsible Person) and the installer",
      "The fire authority inspector"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Both the client (or their designated Responsible Person) and the installer must sign the handover documentation. The client's signature acknowledges receipt of all documentation, confirms they understand their responsibilities, and accepts transfer of legal liability. The installer's signature confirms what was provided and when. Both parties must retain signed copies — typically for six years minimum for the installer, and indefinitely for the client as part of the building's fire safety record."

    question: "What should the installer demonstrate to the client before leaving site?",
    options: [
      "How to replace batteries and luminaires",
      "Monthly and annual test procedures, test switches, fault indicators, and logbook entries",
      "How to redesign the emergency lighting layout",
      "Advanced electrical troubleshooting techniques"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Before leaving site, the installer must demonstrate: (1) How to perform monthly functional tests and annual 3-hour duration tests, (2) How to operate test key switches or monitoring systems, (3) How to recognise fault indicators and charging lights, (4) How to record results in the logbook, and (5) Basic maintenance requirements including battery replacement intervals. The client should not be expected to perform complex electrical repairs — just routine testing and record-keeping."

    id: 7,
    question: "Why must the client be trained in using the logbook?",
    options: [
      "To reduce the installer's workload",
      "To comply with insurance requirements only",
      "To record all tests as required by BS 5266-1 and provide evidence of compliance for fire authorities and insurance",
      "To generate maintenance invoices"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "BS 5266-1 requires that all emergency lighting tests (monthly and annual) must be recorded in a logbook with date, type of test, results, person carrying out the test, and any defects found. This logbook: (1) Provides evidence of compliance for fire authority inspections, (2) Is required for insurance validity, (3) Demonstrates legal responsibility under Fire Safety Order 2005, and (4) Helps track system performance and maintenance history. Failure to maintain the logbook can result in prosecution, insurance claims being rejected, or fire authority enforcement action."

    question: "What could happen if no formal handover takes place?",
    options: [
      "Nothing — the system will work normally",
      "The contractor may remain liable for maintenance failures, face legal disputes, and be required to revisit at their own expense",
      "The client automatically becomes responsible",
      "The fire authority will complete the handover"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Without formal handover: (1) The contractor cannot prove that documentation was provided or training was given, (2) Legal responsibility does not formally transfer, leaving the contractor potentially liable for future failures, (3) The client has no certificates or logbook, meaning they cannot demonstrate compliance during inspections, (4) Disputes often arise about who is responsible for maintenance, and (5) Contractors may be forced to revisit the site at their own expense to reissue documentation and provide training. The London landlord case study demonstrates this exact scenario."

    question: "How long should handover documentation be retained?",
    options: [
      "One year after installation",
      "Until the building changes ownership",
      "For the life of the installation (indefinitely for client), minimum six years for contractor",
      "Only until the warranty expires"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Handover documentation must be retained: (1) For the life of the installation by the client — it becomes part of the building's permanent fire safety record and may be requested during inspections, insurance audits, or property sales, (2) Minimum six years by the contractor for professional liability protection, though longer retention is recommended. Certificates, drawings, and logbooks provide essential evidence of compliance and are legally required under Fire Safety Order 2005."

    question: "What problem occurred in the London landlord case study?",
    options: [
      "The emergency lighting system failed during installation",
      "No formal handover took place, resulting in no documentation or training, leading to contractor liability and expensive revisits",
      "The contractor used incorrect luminaires",
      "The fire authority rejected the installation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "In the London landlord case study, the contractor completed a fully functional installation but failed to conduct formal handover: no commissioning certificates were issued, no logbook was provided, no training was given, and no handover form was signed. Six months later, when the fire authority requested maintenance records, none existed. Because the contractor had no proof of handover, they were legally obligated to revisit the site at their own expense, re-test the system, reissue all documentation, and provide training. This case demonstrates that a signed handover is as critical as the installation itself — without it, the contractor remains liable indefinitely."
