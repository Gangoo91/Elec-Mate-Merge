    question: "What does 'ecosystem conflict' mean in smart homes?",
    options: [
      "When devices are too expensive for the client",
      "When devices from different brands/platforms don't work together properly",
      "When there are too many devices in one room",
      "When the internet connection is unreliable"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Ecosystem conflicts occur when devices, hubs, and platforms from different manufacturers struggle to communicate and integrate seamlessly."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Give one common cause of ecosystem conflicts.",
    options: [
      "Devices being too close together",
      "Using too much electricity",
      "Devices using different communication protocols (Zigbee vs Z-Wave vs Wi-Fi)",
      "Having too many mobile apps installed"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Different communication protocols (Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, etc.) often cannot communicate directly, requiring bridges or hubs for integration."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Why might cloud reliance cause integration issues?",
    options: [
      "Cloud services use too much bandwidth",
      "If cloud servers go down, integrations may break",
      "Cloud storage is too expensive",
      "Clouds block Wi-Fi signals"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When smart home devices depend on cloud servers for integration, any server downtime, maintenance, or service changes can disrupt device communication and automation."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is one symptom of an ecosystem conflict?",
    options: [
      "Devices consume more power than expected",
      "Devices get physically hot",
      "Routines only partially work - some devices respond while others don't",
      "Devices make unusual noises"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Partial routine failures, where only some devices in an automation respond while others don't, is a classic sign of ecosystem conflicts between different platforms."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Why is it important to check device compatibility first when troubleshooting?",
    options: [
      "To determine the warranty status",
      "To avoid wasting time on solutions that won't work with incompatible devices",
      "To calculate the power consumption",
      "To check the device's age"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Starting with compatibility checks prevents wasting time on network or configuration solutions when the fundamental issue is that devices simply cannot work together."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How can simplifying a setup help with troubleshooting?",
    options: [
      "It reduces electricity costs",
      "It makes devices work faster",
      "It removes competing hubs and duplicate integrations that cause conflicts",
      "It makes devices last longer"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Removing duplicate hubs and conflicting integrations eliminates competing control systems that can cause device confusion and unreliable operation."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What role does firmware updating play in resolving ecosystem conflicts?",
    options: [
      "It makes devices use less power",
      "It fixes known compatibility issues and improves integration reliability",
      "It changes the device's physical appearance",
      "It reduces the device's price"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Firmware updates often include fixes for known compatibility issues, improved protocol support, and better integration with other platforms."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Why should clients avoid having too many hubs?",
    options: [
      "Hubs are expensive to maintain",
      "Multiple hubs can compete for device control causing confusion and conflicts",
      "Hubs use too much Wi-Fi bandwidth",
      "Hubs make too much noise"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Multiple hubs can create competing control systems, duplicate device entries, and conflicting automation rules, leading to unreliable system operation."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Give one preventative measure for ecosystem conflicts.",
    options: [
      "Buy the most expensive devices available",
      "Install devices as far apart as possible",
      "Stick to one main ecosystem (e.g., SmartThings + Alexa) when possible",
      "Use only battery-powered devices"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Choosing one primary ecosystem and sticking to it reduces compatibility issues and ensures devices are designed to work together reliably."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "In the real-world Glasgow example, what hub was used to consolidate the conflicting devices?",
    options: [
      "Philips Hue Bridge",
      "Samsung SmartThings",
      "Amazon Echo Hub",
      "Apple HomeKit Hub"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The electrician installed a Samsung SmartThings hub as the primary controller to consolidate the Philips Hue lights, Ring doorbell, and Hive heating system."
