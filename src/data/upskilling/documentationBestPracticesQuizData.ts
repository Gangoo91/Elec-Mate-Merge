    question: "When recording test results on certificates, which approach demonstrates best practice?",
    options: [
      "Record 'PASS' or 'FAIL' for simplicity and clarity",
      "Record actual numerical values with appropriate units and precision",
      "Only record values that are outside acceptable limits",
      "Use approximate values rounded to the nearest whole number"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Recording actual numerical values with appropriate units and precision is essential for professional documentation. This enables trend analysis, fault diagnosis, and demonstrates thoroughness. Generic 'PASS/FAIL' entries provide insufficient information for future reference."

    question: "A client asks you to downgrade a C2 observation to C3 to avoid urgent repair costs. What should you do?",
    options: [
      "Agree to maintain good client relationships",
      "Compromise by adding detailed explanations to justify the change",
      "Refuse and maintain your professional technical assessment",
      "Seek a second opinion before making any changes"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Professional integrity requires maintaining your technical assessment regardless of commercial pressure. Changing observation codes for non-technical reasons compromises safety and exposes you to professional liability. Your assessment must be based on objective technical criteria."

    question: "What is the most important factor when documenting electrical observations?",
    options: [
      "Using standardised terminology and abbreviations",
      "Providing specific, actionable descriptions with supporting evidence",
      "Including photographs for all observations",
      "Referencing specific regulation numbers"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Specific, actionable descriptions with supporting evidence enable effective remedial action and demonstrate professional competence. While other factors are helpful, clear documentation that enables appropriate response is the most critical requirement."

    question: "How should you handle situations where complete testing wasn't possible due to operational constraints?",
    options: [
      "Assume the untested areas are satisfactory",
      "Use average values from similar installations",
      "Clearly document limitations and recommend future investigation",
      "Refuse to issue any certificate until complete testing is possible"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Clear documentation of limitations is essential for professional accountability. Explain what couldn't be tested, why, and recommend appropriate future investigation. This ensures clients understand the scope of the assessment and any associated risks."

    question: "What is the recommended approach for maintaining consistency when multiple inspectors work on the same project?",
    options: [
      "Have the most experienced inspector review all observations",
      "Use different observation codes to identify different inspectors",
      "Establish standardised procedures and decision-making criteria",
      "Complete all documentation after the inspection team leaves site"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Standardised procedures and decision-making criteria ensure consistency across team members. This includes consistent training, regular calibration exercises, peer review processes, and clear communication channels throughout the project."

    question: "If you discover an error in a certificate after issue, what should be your immediate priority?",
    options: [
      "Wait to see if the client notices the error",
      "Assess whether the error affects safety conclusions",
      "Issue a new certificate without mentioning the error",
      "Document the error but take no further action"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Immediately assess whether the error affects safety conclusions. If safety is impacted, notify the client immediately and take appropriate corrective action. All errors should be corrected promptly with proper documentation and version control."

    question: "How long should electrical certificates typically be retained?",
    options: [
      "5 years from issue date",
      "10 years from issue date",
      "For the life of the installation plus reasonable period for legal purposes",
      "Until the next inspection is completed"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Certificates should be retained for the life of the installation plus a reasonable period for legal purposes (typically 6-10 years minimum). This ensures availability for future electrical work, legal requirements, and professional accountability."

    question: "When documenting circuit information, what level of verification is required?",
    options: [
      "Accept existing circuit schedules without verification",
      "Verify key circuits only to save time",
      "Physically verify circuit details against actual installation during inspection",
      "Rely on client information if it appears reasonable"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Physical verification against the actual installation is essential for accurate documentation. Existing schedules may be incorrect or outdated. Professional responsibility requires verification of circuit details to ensure safety and reliability of documentation."

    question: "What is the primary advantage of digital documentation systems for electrical certification?",
    options: [
      "Faster completion of certificates",
      "Built-in validation and error checking procedures", 
      "Reduced costs for consumables",
      "Better client presentation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Built-in validation and error checking procedures are the primary advantage, helping prevent common mistakes, ensuring completeness, and maintaining consistency. While other benefits exist, quality assurance through systematic validation is most important for professional documentation."

    question: "What approach should you take when explaining technical results to non-technical clients?",
    options: [
      "Provide only simplified summaries without technical details",
      "Use full technical terminology to demonstrate competence",
      "Provide clear explanations of safety implications alongside technical details",
      "Refer clients to other technical professionals for explanations"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Provide clear explanations of safety implications alongside maintaining full technical details. This ensures client understanding while maintaining professional documentation standards. Adapt communication style while preserving technical accuracy and completeness."
