    question: "What is the main purpose of a BMS dashboard?",
    options: [
      "To replace the need for trained operators",
      "To convert technical data into actionable information for decision-making",
      "To increase system complexity",
      "To store historical data only"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "BMS dashboards convert complex technical data into clear, actionable information that allows facility managers and operators to quickly assess building performance and make informed decisions."

    question: "Why do dashboards simplify building data?",
    options: [
      "They reduce the amount of data collected",
      "They only show the most important sensors",
      "They present complex control systems as easy-to-read graphics and summaries",
      "They eliminate the need for sensors"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Dashboards simplify building data by presenting complex control systems and hundreds of data points as easy-to-read graphics, charts, and visual summaries that non-technical users can understand."

    question: "Give one example of information displayed on a dashboard floor plan.",
    options: [
      "Electrical cable specifications",
      "Room temperatures with colour-coded zones showing normal/alarm status",
      "Supplier contact details",
      "Maintenance schedules only"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Dashboard floor plans typically display live data overlays such as room temperatures, occupancy status, equipment status, or alarm conditions using colour coding (green=normal, red=alarm, yellow=warning)."

    question: "What is one KPI that might be used in a dashboard?",
    options: [
      "Number of cables installed",
      "Percentage of time within comfort temperature band",
      "Number of drawings produced",
      "Quantity of sensors purchased"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A common KPI displayed on BMS dashboards is '% time within comfort band' which shows how often building conditions meet target ranges, helping assess system performance and occupant comfort."

    question: "Why is remote access important for modern dashboards?",
    options: [
      "It reduces installation costs",
      "It allows operators to monitor and respond to building issues from anywhere",
      "It eliminates the need for on-site equipment",
      "It makes dashboards more complex"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Remote access through web-based dashboards allows facility managers to monitor building performance, respond to alarms, and make adjustments from anywhere using tablets, phones, or laptops."

    question: "What is one risk of miswired sensors feeding into dashboards?",
    options: [
      "Higher electricity costs",
      "Operators make incorrect decisions based on false data displayed",
      "Sensors last longer",
      "Dashboards run faster"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Miswired sensors can display false values on dashboards, leading operators to make incorrect decisions about building systems, potentially affecting comfort, efficiency, and safety."

    question: "Why is accurate labelling important for dashboards?",
    options: [
      "It makes cables look neater",
      "It ensures dashboard displays correspond to the correct equipment and locations",
      "It reduces material costs",
      "It speeds up installation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Accurate labelling ensures that dashboard displays show data from the correct sensors and equipment, preventing confusion and ensuring operators can identify exactly which systems or locations need attention."

    question: "What is the electrician's role in dashboard commissioning?",
    options: [
      "Programming the dashboard software",
      "Testing devices and verifying that field changes appear correctly on dashboards",
      "Training end users",
      "Writing operating manuals"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "During commissioning, electricians test devices and verify that changes in the field (like adjusting thermostats or switching equipment) are reflected accurately and immediately on dashboard displays."

    question: "What type of chart might be used for historical performance in dashboards?",
    options: [
      "Pie charts only",
      "Interactive trend charts showing data over time",
      "Organizational charts",
      "Flow charts"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Interactive trend charts are commonly used in dashboards to display historical performance data over time, allowing operators to analyze patterns, identify issues, and track improvements."

    question: "In the real-world example, why did CO₂ levels appear low on the dashboard?",
    options: [
      "The sensor was too sensitive",
      "The CO₂ sensor had been wired into the wrong input channel",
      "The ventilation system was working perfectly",
      "The dashboard software had a bug"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The CO₂ sensor had been wired into the wrong input channel, causing the dashboard to display values from an unused spare channel instead of the actual sensor readings, masking the real air quality problems."
