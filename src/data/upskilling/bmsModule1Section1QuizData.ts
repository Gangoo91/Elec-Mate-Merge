    question: "How does a BMS improve building efficiency?",
    options: [
      "It makes buildings taller",
      "It reduces energy waste through automated control",
      "It changes the building's appearance",
      "It increases the number of occupants"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A BMS improves efficiency by reducing energy waste through automated control of systems, optimising performance based on occupancy and usage patterns, and monitoring energy consumption."

    question: "What role does a BMS play in compliance and safety?",
    options: [
      "Makes buildings look more professional",
      "Ensures emergency systems work to required standards",
      "Reduces the number of safety inspections needed",
      "Eliminates all safety risks"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A BMS ensures that emergency systems like fire alarms, ventilation, and emergency lighting work to required standards and helps maintain compliance with building regulations and safety codes."

    question: "How does a BMS help reduce environmental impact?",
    options: [
      "Changes the building's exterior colour",
      "Helps buildings meet net-zero and sustainability targets",
      "Reduces the building's physical footprint",
      "Eliminates the need for renewable energy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "A BMS helps reduce environmental impact by optimising energy use, reducing waste, and helping buildings meet net-zero and sustainability targets through intelligent control and monitoring."

    question: "How do modern BMS differ from early building control systems?",
    options: [
      "Modern systems are smaller in size",
      "Modern systems are fully integrated and IoT-connected",
      "Modern systems cost less to install",
      "Modern systems require no maintenance"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Modern BMS are fully integrated systems connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), while early systems were standalone units controlling single elements like heating."
  },

    id: 8,
    question: "Which technological advancement has significantly improved modern BMS?",
    options: [
      "Faster internet speeds only",
      "Predictive analytics and AI capabilities",
      "Better building materials",
      "More efficient light bulbs"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Predictive analytics and AI capabilities have revolutionised BMS by enabling systems to 'learn' usage patterns and optimise performance automatically, making them much smarter than traditional controls."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What is a key difference between BMS and traditional controls?",
    options: [
      "BMS systems are always wireless",
      "BMS provides centralised control vs manual individual controls",
      "BMS systems are only for large buildings",
      "BMS systems don't require electricity"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "The key difference is that BMS provides centralised control and remote access with data-driven decision making, while traditional controls rely on manual switches, time clocks, and independent thermostats."

    question: "Why should electricians understand BMS even if they aren't directly installing them?",
    options: [
      "It's required by law in all countries",
      "Clients increasingly ask for systems that integrate with BMS",
      "It makes electrical work faster",
      "It reduces the cost of electrical installations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Electricians need to understand BMS because clients increasingly rely on them for energy savings and compliance, and may ask electricians to install or maintain systems that integrate into the BMS."
