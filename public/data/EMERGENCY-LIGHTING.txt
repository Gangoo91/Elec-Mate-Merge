Preface
The Electrician’s Guide to Emergency Lighting is one of a number of publications prepared
by the IET to provide guidance on electrical installations in buildings. This publication is
concerned with emergency lighting and in particular emergency escape lighting and must
be read in conjunction with the legislation, Approved Document B and the relevant British
Standards, in particular BS 5266.
Designers and installers should always consult these documents to satisfy themselves of
compliance.
It is expected that persons carrying out work in accordance with this Guide will be
competent to do so, competence being a statutory requirement of the Electricity at Work
Regulations 1989 for those engaged in electrical work.
