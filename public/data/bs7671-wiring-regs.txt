An ew Regulation group (419) has been inserted where automatic disconnection according to Regulation 411.3.2 is
not feasible, such as electronic equipment with limited short-circuit current.

Chapter 42 Protection against thermal effects

A new Regulation 421.1.7 has been introduced recommending the installation of arc fault detection devices (AFDDs)
to mitigate the risk of fire in AC final circuits of a fixed installation due to the effects of arc fault currents.

Regulation 422.2.1 has been redrafted. Reference to conditions BD2, BD3 and BD4 has been deleted. A note has
been added stating that cables need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire and
making reference to Appendix 2, item 17. Requirements have also been included for cables that are supplying safety
circuits.

Chapter 44 Protection against voltage disturbances and electromagnetic disturbances

Section 443, which deals with protection against overvoltages of atmospheric origin or due to switching, has been
redrafted.

The AQ criteria (conditions of external influence for lightning) for determining if protection against transient
overvoltages is needed are no longer included. Instead, protection against transient overvoltages has to be provided
where the consequence caused by overvoltage (see Regulation 443.4):
   (i) could result in serious injury to, or loss of, human life, or
  (ii) could result in interruption of public services/or damage to and cultural heritage, or
  (iii) could result in interruption of commercial or industrial activity, or
  (iv) could affect a large number of co-located individuals.

For all other cases, a risk assessment has to be performed in order to determine if protection against transient
overvoltage is required.

There is an exception not to provide protection for single dwelling units in certain situations.

Chapter 46 Isolation and switching

A new Chapter 46 has been introduced. This deals with non-automatic local and remote isolation and switching
measures for the prevention or removal of dangers associated with electrical installations or electrically powered
equipment. Also, switching for the control of circuits or equipment. Where electrically powered equipment is within
the scope of BS EN 60204, only the requirements of that standard apply.

Chapter 52 Selection and erection of wiring systems

Regulation 521.10.202, which gives requirements for the methods of support of wiring systems, has replaced
Regulation 521.11.201. This is a significant change. Regulation 521.10.202 requires cables to be adequately
supported against their premature collapse in the event of a fire and applies throughout the installation, not just in
escape routes as previously.

Regulation 527.1.3 has also been modified, and a note added stating that cables also need to satisfy the requirements
of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire.

Chapter 53 Protection, isolation, switching, control and monitoring

This chapter has been completely revised and deals with general requirements for protection, isolation, switching,
control and monitoring and with the requirements for selection and erection of the devices provided to fulfil such
functions.

Section 534 Devices for protection against overvoltage

This section focuses mainly on the requirements for the selection and erection of SPDs for protection against
transient overvoltages where required by Section 443, the BS EN 62305 series, or as otherwise stated. Section 534
has been completely revised. The most significant technical change refers to the selection requirements for the
voltage protection level.

Chapter 54 Earthing arrangements and protective conductors

Two new regulations (542.2.3 and 542.2.8) have been introduced concerning earth electrodes.

Chapter 55 Other equipment

Regulation 550.1 introduces a new scope.



                                                                                                                         5
New Regulation 559.10 refers to ground-recessed luminaires, the selection and erection of which shall take account
of the guidance given in Table A.1 of BS EN 60598-2-13.

Part 6 Inspection and testing
Part 6 has been completely restructured, including the regulation numbering to align with the CENELEC standard.
Chapters 61, 62 and 63 have been deleted and their content now forms two new Chapters 64 and 65.

Section 704 Construction and demolition site installations
This section contains a number of small changes, including requirements for external influences
(Regulation 704.512.2), and a modification to Regulation 704.410.3.6 to include the non-use of the protective
measure of electrical separation.

Section 708 Electrical installations in caravan/camping parks and similar locations
This section contains a number of changes including requirements for socket-outlets, RCD protection, and
operational conditions and external influences.

Section 710 Medical locations
This section contains a number of small changes including the removal of Table 710, and changes to Regulations
710.415.2.1 to 710.415.2.3 concerning equipotential bonding. In addition, a new Regulation 710.421.1.201 states
requirements regarding the installation of AFDDs.

Section 715 Extra-low voltage lighting installations
This section contains only minor changes including modifications to Regulation 715.524.201.

Section 721 Electrical installations in caravans and motor caravans
This section contains a number of changes to the requirements concerning electrical separation, RCDs, proximity to
non-electrical services and protective bonding conductors.

Section 722 Electric vehicle charging installations
This section contains significant changes to Regulation 722.411.4.1 concerning the use of a PME supply. The
exception concerning reasonably practicable has been deleted. Changes have also been made to requirements for
external influences, RCDs, socket-outlets and connectors.

Section 730 Onshore units of electrical shore connections for inland navigation vessels
This is an entirely new section. Section 730 applies to onshore installations dedicated to the supply of inland
navigation vessels for commercial and administrative purposes, berthed in ports and berths. Most, if not all, of the
measures used to reduce the risks in marinas apply equally to electrical shore connections for inland navigation
vessels. One of the major differences between supplies to vessels in a typical marina and electrical shore connections
for inland navigation vessels is the size of the supply needed.

Section 753 Heating cables and embedded heating systems
This retitled section has been completely revised. The scope of Section 753 has been extended to apply to embedded
electric heating systems for surface heating. The requirements also apply to electric heating systems for de-icing,
frost prevention and similar applications, and cover both indoor and outdoor systems. Heating systems for industrial
and commercial applications complying with BS EN 60519, BS EN 62395 and BS EN 60079 are not covered.

Appendices
The following main changes have been made within the appendices:

Appendix 1 British Standards to which reference is made in the Regulations has been updated, as necessary.
Appendix 3 Time/current characteristics of overcurrent protective devices and RCDs
The previous content of Appendix 14 concerning earth fault loop impedance has been moved into Appendix 3.

Appendix 6 Model forms for certification and reporting
This appendix includes minor changes to the certificates, changes to the inspections (for new installation work
only) for domestic and similar premises with up to 100 A supply, and examples of items requiring inspection for an
electrical installation condition report.
Appendix 8 Current-carrying capacity and voltage drop for busbar trunking and powertrack systems
This appendix includes changes regarding rating factors for current-carrying capacity.

Appendix 14 Determination of prospective fault current
As stated earlier, the content of Appendix 14 concerning earth fault loop impedance has been moved into
Appendix 3. Appendix 14 now contains information on the determination of prospective fault current.

Appendix 17 Energy efficiency
This is a new appendix that provides recommendations for the design and erection of electrical installations,
including installations having local production and storage of energy, for optimizing the overall efficient use of
electricity.

The recommendations within the scope of this appendix apply for new electrical installations and modification of
existing electrical installations. Much of this appendix will not apply to domestic and similar installations.

It is intended that this appendix will be developed into Part 8 of BS 7671 in a future amendment.




                             Introduction to Amendment 1:2020

                                                                                                                        7
                                   Introduction to Amendment 2:2022
    BS 7671:2018+A2:2022 Requirements for Electrical Installations was issued on 28th March 2022 and
    may be implemented immediately. BS 7671:2018+A1:2020 remains current and will be withdrawn on
    27th September 2022.

    The Regulations apply to the design, erection and verification of electrical installations, also additions and alterations
    to existing installations. Existing installations that have been installed in accordance with earlier editions of the
    Regulations may not comply with this edition in every respect. This does not necessarily mean that they are unsafe
    for continued use or require upgrading.

    Contractual and legal considerations

    This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions of a contract. Users are responsible for its
    correct application. Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity from legal obligations.
    NOTE 1 : Completion of an electrical installation designed to the withdrawn standard can be subject to the contractual agreement
             between all parties involved.
    NOTE 2: BSI publishes information on the uses of withdrawn British Standards.

    A summary of the main changes is given below.
    NOTE 3: This is not an exhaustive list.

    Part 1 Scope, Object and Fundamental principles

    Minor changes have been made including reference to prosumers electrical installations and installing
    fibre optic cables.

    Part 2 Definitions

    Definitions have been expanded and modified.

    Chapter 41 Protection against electric shock

    Section 411 contains a number of significant changes. Some of the main changes are mentioned below.

    Regulation 411.3.1.2 has been redrafted. The regulation now requires that in each consumer’s installation within a
    building extraneous-conductive-parts that are liable to introduce a dangerous potential difference be connected to
    the main earthing terminal.

    A note has been added clarifying that where non-metallic pipes, e.g. plastic, enter the building and are then connected
    to metallic pipes within the building, the metallic pipes within the building do not normally require protective
    bonding as they are unlikely to be extraneous-conductive-parts. Reference to insulating sections has been removed.

    Regulation 411.3.3 has been redrafted and now has three indents. There is still an exception to omit RCD protection
    where, other than BAI, BA3 or children (BA2, BA3) and mobile equipment (not exceeding 32 A) for use outdoors,
    a suitably documented risk assessment determines that RCD protection is not necessary.

    Regulation 411.4.2 now recommends an additional connection to Earth, by means of an earth electrode in accordance
    with Chapter 54, is made to the main earthing terminal.

    Chapter 42 Protection against thermal effects

    Regulation 421.1.7 has been redrafted. It is now a requirement to protect final circuits supplying socket-outlets with
    a rated current not exceeding 32 A using arc fault detection devices (AFDD) in Higher Risk Residential Buildings,
    Houses in Multiple Occupation, Purpose-built student accommodation and Care homes. For all other premises, the
    regulation recommends AFDDs for single-phase AC final circuits supplying socket-outlets not exceeding 32 A. The
    use of AFDDs does not obviate the need to apply one or more measures provided in other clauses in this standard.

    Regulation 422.1 (precautions where particular risks of fire exist) now introduces requirements for the fire safety
    design of the building(s) to be documented. Also requirements have been added where cables should have an
    improved fire performance.

    Regulation 422.2 now introduces separate requirements for escape routes and a new concept of 'protected escape
    routes'. Reference to conditions BD2, BD3 and BD4 have been deleted.




8
Chapter 44 Protection against voltage disturbances and electromagnetic disturbances

Regulation 443.4 for determining if protection against transient overvoltages is needed has been redrafted.
Regulation 443.4.1 now requires protection against transient overvoltages to be provided where the consequence
caused by the overvoltage could result in:
   (i) serious injury to, or loss of, human life
  (ii) failure of a safety service, as defined in Part 2
  (iii) significant financial or data loss.

For all other cases, protection against transient overvoltages shall be provided unless the owner of the installation
declares it is not required due to any loss or damage being tolerable and they accept the risk of damage to equipment
and any consequential loss.

Regulation 443.4.2 requires protection against overvoltages to be considered in the case of equipment likely to
produce switching overvoltages or disturbances and gives conditions.

Regulation 443.5 (Risk assessment method) has been deleted and Annex A443 (examples of calculated risk level
CRL for use of SPDs) has also been deleted.

Section 514 Identification and notices

Section 514 contains a number of significant changes (including illustrations of notices which have been removed
and examples are provided in Appendix 11). Some of the main changes are mentioned below.

Table 51 has been modified slightly to take into account changes of colour identification for DC and abbreviations
have been added.
Regulation 514.9.1 now contains an exception for domestic (household) premises.

Regulation 514.9.2 has been introduced to advise that all diagrams, charts, and information or instruction notices
comply with the applicable standards specified.

Regulation 514.12 (Notices: periodic inspection and testing) now contains an exception for domestic (household)
premises in certain situations.
Regulation 514.12.2, concerning the RCD notice, has been modified and now contains an exception for domestic
(household) premises in certain situations.

Regulation 514.14 concerning non-standard colours has been deleted.

A new Regulation 514.16.1 has been introduced requiring a label to indicate the presence of SPDs. However, there
is an exception for domestic (household) premises or similar.

Chapter 53 Protection, isolation, switching, control and monitoring

Regulation 531.3.2 indent (ii) highlights the use of RCBOs for individual final circuits in residential premises to
minimise unwanted tripping.

Regulation 531.3.3 now states that RCD Type AC shall only be used to serve fixed equipment, where it is known
that the load current contains no DC components.

Chapter 54 Earthing arrangements and protective conductors

Modifications have been made to Regulation Group 543.7 concerning earthing requirements for the installation of
equipment having high protective conductor currents.

Regulation 544.1.1 concerning main protective bonding conductors has also been revised.

Chapter 55 Other equipment

551.7 Additional requirements have been added for installations where the generating set or sets may operate in
parallel with other sources including systems for distribution of electricity to the public.

551.7.2 includes additional conditions.

554.4 Heating conductors and cables Regulations 554.4.2, 554.4.3, and 554.4.4 have been deleted.




                                                                                                                        9
Section 753 Heating cables and embedded heating systems

Changes include the addition of new regulations (relocated from Chapter 53) covering impact and the installation
of heating cables.

Chapter 82 Prosumer’s low-voltage electrical installations

This is an entirely new chapter. Historically, utility companies have managed the public transmission and distribution
network from the point of view of having central production adapted to demand variation. The objective of this
chapter is to provide requirements, such that, low-voltage electrical installations are compatible with the current
and future ways to deliver safely the electrical energy to cunent-using equipment either from the public network or
from other local sources.

Chapter 82 provides additional requirements, measures and recommendations for design, erection and verification
of all types of low voltage electrical installations. This includes local production and/or storage of energy in order
to achieve compatibility with existing and future ways to deliver electrical energy to current-using equipment or to
the public network by means of local sources. Such electrical installations are designated as Prosumer’s Electrical
Installations (PEIs).

Appendices

The following main changes have been made within the Appendices:

Appendix 3 Table 3A, covering the tripping times of RCDs, has been deleted.

Appendix 4 includes minor changes concerning a cable surrounded by thermal insulation.

Appendix 6 Model forms for certification and reporting

Minor changes have been made to the model forms and guidance for recipients. These include the addition of fields
for recording the details of SPDs and AFDDs.

The schedule of inspections has been simplified for initial verification. A new example checklist of items requiring
inspection during initial verification has been added to Appendix 6 but is not required to be provided with the
certificate.

The single page generic schedule of test results used for EIC and EICR has been redrafted. There is now a separate
page for the schedule of circuit details and a separate page for the schedule of test results.

Appendix 7 Deleted by BS 7671:2018+A2:2022

Appendix 11 Warning and user instruction labels

This is a new appendix that provides guidance for the types of safety signs, warning signs and instructions required
to be applied to electrical installations.

Appendix 13 Escape routes and fire protection

The previous content of Appendix 13 concerning methods for measuring the insulation resistance/impedance of
floors and walls to Earth has been removed and replaced by guidance on escape routes and fire protection. The
new content of Appendix 13 provides detailed guidance on protected escape routes in order to afford a safe passage
through the building to an exit.

Appendix 17 Energy efficiency

This appendix includes changes to the scope to cover dwellings and reference to the Building Regulations, changes
to user decisions, also new design recommendations, new information on determination of meshes, new information
on user requirements, new guidance covering impacts on the design of an installation, and new guidance on periodic
assessment.

     The dates in brackets refer to the year of issue of amendments to the documents.

     Where the above documents contain UK special national conditions, those conditions have been incorporated within
     BS 7671. If BS 7671 is applied in other countries the above documents should be consulted to confirm the status of
     a particular regulation.

     BS 7671 will continue to be amended from time to time to take account of the publication of new or amended
     CENELEC and IEC standards. The opportunity has been taken to revise regulations that experience has shown
     require clarification or to allow for new technology and methods.

     Reference is made throughout BS 7671 to publications of the British Standards Institution, both specifications and
     codes of practice. Appendix 1 lists these publications and gives their full titles whereas throughout BS 7671 they
     are referred to only by their numbers.

     Where reference is made in BS 7671 to a British Standard which takes account of a CENELEC Harmonization
     Document, European Norm (EN) or IEC standard, it is understood that the reference also relates to any European
     national standard similarly derived from the CENELEC standard, although account needs to be taken of any national
     exemptions.

                         Note by the Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) welcomes the publication of BS 7671:2018, Requirements for Electrical
Installations, IET Wiring Regulations 18th Edition and its updating with the second amendment, published in 2022.
BS 7671 and the IET/IEE Wiring Regulations have been extensively referred to in HSE guidance over the years.
Installations which conform to the standards laid down in BS 7671:2018+A2:2022 are regarded by HSE as likely
to achieve conformity with the relevant parts of the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. Installations to which
BS 7671 is relevant may have been designed and installed in accordance with an earlier edition, now superseded but
then current. That, in itself, would not mean that the installation would fail to comply with the Electricity at Work
Regulations, 1989.

                            Notes on the plan of the 18th Edition
This Edition is based on the plan agreed internationally for the arrangement of safety rules for electrical installations.

The regulation numbering follows the pattern and corresponding references of IEC HD 60364 series. The numbering
does not, therefore, necessarily follow sequentially. The numbering system used in Part 7 is explained in Section 700.

In the numbering system used, the first digit signifies a Part, the second digit a Chapter, the third digit a Section and
the subsequent digits the Regulation number. For example, Section number 413 is made up as follows:

            PART 4 - PROTECTION FOR SAFETY

            Chapter 41 (first chapter of Part 4) - PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTRIC SHOCK

            Section 413 (third section of Chapter 41) - PROTECTIVE MEASURE: ELECTRICAL SEPARATION

Part 1      sets out the scope, object and fundamental principles.

Part 2      defines the sense in which certain terms are used throughout the Regulations, and provides a list of
            symbols used and a list of abbreviations used in the Standard.

The subjects of the subsequent parts are as indicated below:
Part                                                           Subject
Part 3      Identification of the characteristics of the installation that will need to be taken into account in
            choosing and applying the requirements of the subsequent Parts. These characteristics may vary
            from one part of an installation to another and should be assessed for each location to be served by
            the installation.
Part 4      Description of the measures that are available for the protection of persons, livestock and property,
            and against the hazards that may arise from the use of electricity.
Part 5      Precautions to be taken in the selection and erection of the equipment of the installation.
Part 6      Inspection and testing.
Part 7      Special installations or locations - particular requirements.
Part 8      Functional requirements


The sequence of the plan should be followed in considering the application of any particular requirement of the
Regulations. The general index provides a ready reference to particular regulations by subject, but in applying any
one regulation the requirements of related regulations should be borne in mind. Cross-references are provided, and
the index is arranged to facilitate this.

In many cases, a group of associated regulations is covered by a side heading which is identified by a two-part
number, e.g. 544.2. Throughout the Regulations where reference is made to such a two-part number, that reference
is to be taken to include all the individual regulation numbers which are covered by that side heading and include
that two-part number.

The Regulations use the IEC decimal point numbering system to make it easier to embody future changes and
additions resulting from ongoing international standards work within IEC and CENELEC. In order to identify and
accommodate future IEC changes some regulations carry either a 100 or 200 number where 100 numbers represent
CENELEC Harmonization Document reference numbers and 200 numbers represent UK-only regulations. Some
regulations have not been 'updated' to indicate 100 and 200 numbers; that will only be done when those regulations
require a significant rewrite.




                                                                                                                             17

Short-circuit protective device (SCPD). Device intended to protect a circuit or part of a circuit against short-circuit
currents by interrupting them.
NOTE: Table A53.1 provides information regarding the different devices corresponding to the main generic function.
Show. Display or presentation in any suitable location, either a room, building or temporary structure.
Simple separation. Separation between circuits or between a circuit and Earth by means of basic insulation.
Simultaneously accessible parts. Conductors or conductive parts which can be touched simultaneously by a person
or, in locations specifically intended for them, by livestock.
NOTE: Simultaneously accessible parts may be: live parts, exposed-conductive-parts, extraneous-conductive-parts, protective
          conductors or earth electrodes.

Skilled person (electrically). Person who possesses, as appropriate to the nature of the electrical work to be
undertaken, adequate education, training and practical skills, and who is able to perceive risks and avoid hazards
which electricity can create.
NOTE 1 : The term ‘(electrically)’ is assumed to be present where the term 'skilled person' is used throughout BS 7671.
NOTE 2: Regulation 16 of the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 requires persons to be competent to prevent danger and
          injury. The HSE publication HSR25 provides guidance on this.

Socket-outlet. A device, provided with female contacts, which is intended to be installed with the fixed wiring, and
intended to receive a plug. A luminaire track system is not regarded as a socket-outlet system.
SPD disconnector. Device for disconnecting an SPD, or part of an SPD, from the power system.
NOTE: This disconnecting device is not required to have isolating capability for safety purposes. It is to prevent a persistent
          fault on the system and is used to give an indication of an SPD’s failure. Disconnectors can be internal (built in)
          or external (required by the manufacturer). There may be more than one disconnector function, for example an
          overcurrent protection function and a thermal protection function. These functions may be in separate units.

Spur.A branch from a ring or radial final circuit.
Stand. Area or temporary structure used for display, marketing or sales.
Standard test conditions (STC). Test conditions specified in BS EN 60904-3 for PV cells and PV modules.
Standby electrical source. Electrical source intended to maintain, for reasons other than safety, the supply to an
electrical installation or a part or parts thereof, in case of interruption of the normal supply.
Standby electrical supply system. Supply system intended to maintain, for reasons other than safety, the functioning
of an electrical installation or a part or parts thereof, in case of interruption of the normal supply.
Static convertor.A convertor having no moving parts and notably using semiconductor rectifiers.
Stationary equipment. Electrical equipment which is either fixed or which has a mass exceeding 18 kg and is not
provided with a carrying handle.
Street furniture. Fixed equipment located on a highway.
Supplementary insulation. Independent insulation applied in addition to basic insulation for fault protection.
Supplier (see Distributor).
Surge current, {534}. A transient wave appearing as an overcurrent caused by a lightning electromagnetic impulse.
Surge protective device (SPD), {534}. A device that is intended to limit transient overvoltages and divert surge
currents. It contains at least one non-linear component.
Switch, linked. A switch the contacts of which are so arranged as to make or break all poles simultaneously or in a
definite sequence.
Switch. A device designed to make or break the current in one or more electric circuits.
Switch-disconnector. A switch which, in the open position, satisfies the isolating requirements specified for a
disconnector.
NOTE: A switch-disconnector is otherwise known as an isolating switch.
Switchboard. An assembly of switchgear with or without instruments, but the term does not apply to groups of local
switches in final circuits.

Voltage, reduced (see Reduced low voltage system).

Voltage band
        Band I
        Band I covers:
        - installations where protection against electric shock is provided under certain conditions by the value
          of voltage;
        - installations where the voltage is limited for operational reasons (e.g. telecommunications, signalling,
          bell, control and alarm installations).
        Extra-low voltage (ELV) will normally fall within voltage Band I.
        Band II
        Band II contains the voltages for supplies to household and most commercial and industrial installations.
        Low voltage (LV) will normally fall within voltage Band II.
NOTE: Band II voltages do not exceed 1000 V AC rms or 1500 V DC.
Voltage protection level (Up), {534}. A parameter that characterizes the performance of an SPD in limiting the
voltage across its terminals, which is selected from a list of preferred values; this value is greater than the highest
value of the measured limiting voltages.
Wiring system. An assembly made up of cable or busbars and parts which secure and, if necessary, enclose the
cable or busbars.

                                               CHAPTER 30
301           ASSESSMENT OF GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
301.1          An assessment shall be made of the following characteristics of the installation in accordance with
the chapters indicated:
   (i) The purpose(s) for which the installation is intended to be used, its general structure and its supplies
        (Chapter 31)
  (ii)   The external influences to which it is to be exposed (Chapter 32)
 (iii)   The compatibility of its equipment (Chapter 33)
 (iv)    Its maintainability (Chapter 34)
  (v)    Recognized safety services (Chapter 35)
 (vi)    Assessment for continuity of service (Chapter 36).
These characteristics shall be taken into account in the choice of methods of protection for safety (see Chapters
41 to 44), isolation and switching (Chapter 46 and Section 537) and the selection and erection of equipment
(Chapters 51 to 56).

                                               CHAPTER 31
                        PURPOSES, SUPPLIES AND STRUCTURE
311           MAXIMUM DEMAND AND DIVERSITY
311.1           For economic and reliable design of an installation within thermal limits and admissible voltage
drop, the maximum demand shall be determined. In determining the maximum demand of an installation or part
thereof, diversity may be taken into account.
312           CONDUCTOR ARRANGEMENT AND SYSTEM EARTHING
The following characteristics shall be assessed:
   (i) Arrangement of current-carrying conductors under normal operating conditions
  (ii) Type of system earthing.

312.1          General
The following arrangements of current-carrying conductors under normal operating conditions are taken into
account in BS 7671.
312.1.1        Current-carrying conductors in AC circuits

                                         Fig 3.1 - Single-phase 2-wire

                                                                    L


                                                                    N




                                                                                                                     51
                                             Fig 3.2 - Single-phase 3-wire




                                                  Phase angle 0°
                                         * Numbering of conductors optional




                                       * Numbering of conductors optional

                                             Fig 3.5 - Three-phase 4-wire




Three-phase, 4-wire with neutral conductor or PEN conductor. By definition, the PEN conductor is not a live
conductor but a conductor carrying an operating current.
NOTE 1 : In the case of a single-phase 2-wire arrangement which is derived from a three-phase 4-wire arrangement, the two
         conductors are either two line conductors or a line conductor and a neutral conductor or a line conductor and a PEN
         conductor.
NOTE 2: In installations with all loads connected between lines, the installation of the neutral conductor may not be necessary.
312.1.2             Current-carrying conductors in DC circuits


                      Fig 3.6 - 2-wire                                             Fig 3.7 - 3-wire




NOTE:        PEL and PEM conductors are not live conductors although they carry operating current. Therefore, the designation
             2-wire arrangement or 3-wire arrangement applies.

312.2               Types of system earthing

The following types of system earthing are taken into account in BS 7671.
NOTE 1: Figures 3.8 to 3.10 show examples of commonly used three-phase systems. For IT, multiple source, DC and other
        systems see Appendix 9.
NOTE 2: For private systems, the source and/or the distribution system may be considered as part of the installation within the
        meaning of BS 7671.
NOTE 3: The codes used have the following meanings:


         First letter - Relationship of the power system to Earth:
         T      =    direct connection of one point to Earth
         I      =    all live parts isolated from Earth, or one point connected to Earth through a high impedance.
         Second letter - Relationship of the exposed-conductive-parts of the installation to Earth:
         T      =    direct electrical connection of exposed-conductive-parts to Earth, independently of the earthing of
                     any point of the power system
         N      =    direct electrical connection of the exposed-conductive-parts to the earthed point of the power
                     system (in AC systems, the earthed point of the power system is normally the neutral point or, if a
                     neutral point is not available, a line conductor).
         Subsequent letter(s) (if any) - Arrangement of neutral and protective conductors:
         S      =    protective function provided by a conductor separate from the neutral conductor or from the earthed
                     line (or, in AC systems, earthed phase) conductor
         C      =    neutral and protective functions combined in a single conductor (PEN conductor).




                                                                                                                                  53
     312.2.1        TN systems

     312.2.1.1     Single-source systems
     TN systems have one point directly earthed at the source, the exposed-conductive parts of the installation(s)
     being connected to that point by protective conductors. Two types of TN system are considered according to the
     arrangement of neutral and protective conductors, as follows:

                                                   Fig 3.8 - TN-S system




     Separate neutral and protective conductors throughout the system.
     The protective conductor (PE) is the metallic covering of the cable supplying the installations or a separate conductor.

     All exposed-conductive-parts of an installation are connected to this protective conductor via the main earthing
     terminal of the installation.


                                              Fig 3.9 - TN-C-S (PME) system




     Neutral and protective functions combined in a single conductor (PEN) in a part of the system.
     This type of distribution is known also as protective multiple earthing (PME).

     The supply system PEN conductor is earthed at two or more points and an earth electrode may be necessary at or
     near a consumer’s installation.

     All exposed-conductive-parts of an installation are connected to the PEN conductor via the main earthing terminal
     and the neutral terminal, these terminals being linked together.



54
312.2.2        TT system

312.2.2.1      Single-source system
A TT system has only one point directly earthed at the source, the exposed-conductive-parts of the installation(s)
being connected to earth electrodes electrically independent of the earth electrode of the supply system (the source
earth).

                                                Fig 3.10 - TT system




All exposed-conductive-parts of an installation are connected to an earth electrode which is electrically independent
of the source earth.
Separate neutral and protective conductors throughout the system.

NOTE: Additional earthing of the PE in the installation may be provided.
312.3           Not used

312.4          IT, multiple source, DC and other systems
See Appendix 9.

313           SUPPLIES

313.1          General
The following characteristics of the supply or supplies, from whatever source, and the normal range of those
characteristics where appropriate, shall be determined by calculation, measurement, enquiry or inspection:
   (i) The nominal voltage(s) and its characteristics including harmonic distortion
  (ii)   The nature of the current and frequency
  (iii) The prospective short-circuit current at the origin of the installation
  (iv) The earth fault loop impedance of that part of the system external to the installation, Z e
  (v)    The suitability for the requirements of the installation, including the maximum demand
  (vi)   The type and rating of the overcurrent protective device(s) acting at the origin of the installation.

These characteristics shall be ascertained for an external supply and shall be determined for a private source. These
requirements are equally applicable to main supplies and to safety services and standby supplies.
NOTE: The above information should be provided by distributors on request (see Appendix 2 sec 2).




                                                                                                                        55
     313.2          Supplies for safety services and standby systems

     Where the provision of safety services is required, for example, by the authorities concerned with fire precautions
     and other conditions for emergency evacuation of the premises, and/or where the provision of standby supplies is
     required by the person specifying the installation, the characteristics of the source or sources of supply for safety
     services and/or standby systems shall be separately assessed. Such supplies shall have adequate capacity, reliability
     and rating and appropriate changeover time for the operation specified.
     NOTE 1 : For further requirements for supplies for safety services, see Chapter 35 hereafter and Chapter 56.
     NOTE 2: For standby systems, there are no particular requirements in these Regulations.

     314           DIVISION OF INSTALLATION

     314.1           Every installation shall be divided into circuits, as necessary, to:
        (i) avoid danger and minimize inconvenience in the event of a fault
       (ii) facilitate safe inspection, testing and maintenance (see also Chapter 46 and Section 537)
       (iii) take account of hazards that may arise from the failure of a single circuit such as a lighting circuit
       (iv) reduce the possibility of unwanted tripping of RCDs due to excessive protective conductor (PE) currents not
            due to a fault
       (v)   mitigate the effects of electromagnetic disturbances (see also Chapter 44)
       (vi) prevent the indirect energizing of a circuit intended to be isolated.

     314.2          Separate circuits shall be provided for parts of the installation which need to be separately controlled,
     in such a way that those circuits are not affected by the failure of other circuits, and due account shall be taken of the
     consequences of the operation of any single protective device.

     314.3           The number of final circuits required, and the number of points supplied by any final circuit, shall
     be such as to facilitate compliance with the requirements of Chapter 43 for overcurrent protection, Chapter 46 and
     Section 537 for isolation and switching and Chapter 52 as regards current-carrying capacities of conductors.
     314.4           Where an installation comprises more than one final circuit, each final circuit shall be connected to a
     separate way in a distribution board. The wiring of each final circuit shall be electrically separate from that of every
     other final circuit, so as to prevent the indirect energizing of a final circuit intended to be isolated.

331           COMPATIBILITY OF CHARACTERISTICS

331.1          An assessment shall be made of any characteristics of equipment likely to have harmful effects
upon other electrical equipment or other services or likely to impair the supply, for example, for coordination with
concerned parties e.g. petrol stations, kiosks and shops within shops. Those characteristics include, for example:
   (i) transient overvoltages
  (ii)   undervoltage
  (iii) unbalanced loads
  (iv) rapidly fluctuating loads
  (v) starting currents
  (vi) harmonic currents
 (vii) earth leakage current
(viii) excessive PE conductor current not due to a fault
  (ix) DC feedback
  (x) high-frequency oscillations
  (xi) necessity for additional connections to Earth
 (xii) power factor.

For an external source of energy the distributor shall be consulted regarding any equipment of the installation having
a characteristic likely to have significant influence on the supply.

332           ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY

332.1         All electrical equipment forming part of an electrical installation shall meet the appropriate
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements and shall be in accordance with the relevant EMC standard.

332.2           Consideration shall be given by the designer of the electrical installation to measures reducing the
effect of induced voltage disturbances and electromagnetic interferences (EMI). Measures are given in Chapter 44.

                                              MAINTAINABILITY
341           GENERAL

341.1         An assessment shall be made of the frequency and quality of maintenance the installation can
reasonably be expected to receive during its intended life. The person or body responsible for the operation and/or
maintenance of the installation shall be consulted. Those characteristics are to be taken into account in applying the
requirements of Parts 4 to 8 so that, having regard to the frequency and quality of maintenance expected:
   (i) any periodic inspection and testing, maintenance and repairs likely to be necessary during the intended life
       can be readily and safely carried out, and
  (ii) the effectiveness of the protective measures for safety during the intended life shall not diminish, and
 (iii) the reliability of equipment for proper functioning of the installation is appropriate to the intended life.
NOTE:     There may be particular statutory requirements relating to maintenance.




                                                                                                                         57

                                              SAFETY SERVICES
351            GENERAL
NOTE 1: The need for safety services and their nature are frequently regulated by statutory authorities whose requirements have
        to be observed.
NOTE 2: Examples of safety services are: emergency escape lighting, fire detection and fire alarm systems, installations for fire
        pumps, firefighters lifts, smoke and heat extraction equipment.

351.1           The following electrical sources for safety services are recognized:
   (i)   Storage batteries
  (ii)   Primary cells
 (iii)   Generator sets independent of the normal supply
 (iv)    A separate feeder of the supply network that is effectively independent of the normal feeder (see Regulation
         560.6.5).

352           CLASSIFICATION

Refer to Regulation 560.4.

                                        CONTINUITY OF SERVICE
361           GENERAL

361.1          An assessment shall be made for each circuit of any need for continuity of service considered
necessary during the intended life of the installation, e.g. life-support systems. The following characteristics shall
be considered:
   (i) Selection of the system earthing
  (ii) Selection of the protective device in order to achieves electivity
 (iii) Number of circuits
  (iv) Multiple power supplies
   (v) Use of monitoring devices.
Simultaneously accessible exposed-conductive-parts shall be connected to the same earthing system individually,
in groups or collectively.
Conductors for protective earthing shall comply with Chapter 54.
A circuit protective conductor shall be run to and terminated at each point in wiring and at each accessory except a
lampholder having no exposed-conductive-parts and suspended from such a point.

411.3.1.2        Protective equipotential bonding

In each consumer’s installation within a building, extraneous-conductive-parts liable to introduce a dangerous
potential difference shall be connected to the main earthing terminal by protective bonding conductors complying
with Chapter 54. Examples of extraneous-conductive-parts may include:
    (i) metallic water installation pipes
   (ii) metallic gas installation pipes
  (iii) other metallic installation pipework and ducting
  (iv) central heating and air conditioning systems
   (v) exposed metallic structural parts of the building.
NOTE:       Where non-metallic pipes (e.g. plastic) enter a building and are then connected to metallic pipes within the building,
            the metallic pipes within the building do not normally require protective bonding as they are unlikely to be
            extraneous-conductive-parts.

Connection of a lightning protection system to the protective equipotential bonding shall be made in accordance
with BS EN 62305.
Where an installation serves more than one building the above requirement shall be applied to each building.
Where an incoming telecommunication cable has a metallic sheath, equipotential bonding shall be applied.
However, the consent of the owner or operator of the cable shall be obtained. Where consent is not granted, and
as a consequence this requirement is not met, details shall be recorded in the description section of the appropriate
electrical certification specified in Part 6.
411.3.2          Automatic disconnection in case of a fault

411.3.2.1       Except as provided by Regulation 411.3.2.5, a protective device shall automatically interrupt the
supply to the line conductor of a circuit or equipment in the event of a fault of negligible impedance between the
line conductor and an exposed-conductive-part or a protective conductor in the circuit or equipment within the
disconnection time required by Regulation 411.3.2.2, 411.3.2.3 or 411.3.2.4.
The protective device shall be suitable for isolation of at least the line conductor.
NOTE:     For IT systems, automatic disconnection is not necessarily required on the occurrence of a first fault
          (see Regulation 4 11.6.1). For the requirements for disconnection in the event of a second fault, occurring on a different
          live conductor, see Regulation 411.6.5.

411.3.2.2      Maximum disconnection times stated in Table 41.1 shall be applied to final circuits with a rated
current not exceeding:
   (i) 63 A with one or more socket-outlets, and
  (ii) 32 A supplying only fixed connected current-using equipment.
411.7.2        Requirements for basic protection
Basic protection shall be provided by either:
   (i) basic insulation according to Regulation 416.1 corresponding to the nominal voltage of the primary circuit
       of the source, or
  (ii) barriers or enclosures in accordance with Regulation 416.2.

411.7.3        Requirements for fault protection

The exposed-conductive-parts of the equipment of the FELV circuit shall be connected to the protective conductor of
the primary circuit of the source, provided that the primary circuit is subject to protection by automatic disconnection
of supply as described in Regulations 411.3 to 411.6.

411.7.4        Sources

The source of the FELV system shall either be a transformer with at least simple separation between windings or
shall comply with Regulation 414.3.

If an extra-low voltage system is supplied from a higher voltage system by equipment which does not provide
at least simple separation between that system and the extra-low voltage system, such as an autotransformer, a
potentiometer or a semiconductor device, the output circuit is not part of a FELV system and is deemed to be an
extension of the input circuit and shall be protected by the protective measure applied to the input circuit.
NOTE:     This does not preclude connecting a conductor of the FELV circuit to the protective conductor of the primary circuit.

411.7.5        Plugs, socket-outlets, LSCs, DCLs and cable couplers

Every plug, socket-outlet, luminaire supporting coupler (LSC), device for connecting a luminaire (DCL) and cable
coupler in a FELV system shall have a protective conductor contact and shall not be dimensionally compatible with
those used for any other system in use in the same premises.

411.8          Reduced low voltage systems

411.8.1        General

411.8.1.1      Where, for functional reasons, the use of extra-low voltage is impracticable and there is no requirement
for the use of SELV or PELV, a reduced low voltage system may be used, for which the provisions described in
Regulations 411.8.2 to 411.8.5 shall be made to provide basic protection and fault protection.

411.8.1.2      The nominal voltage of the reduced low voltage circuits shall not exceed 110 V AC rms between
lines (three-phase 63.5 V to earthed neutral, single-phase 55 V to earthed midpoint).

411.8.2        Requirements for basic protection

Basic protection shall be provided by either:
   (i) basic insulation according to Regulation 416.1 corresponding to the maximum nominal voltage of the
       reduced low voltage system given in Regulation 411.8.1.2, or
  (ii) barriers or enclosures in accordance with Regulation 416.2.

411.8.3        Requirements for fault protection

Fault protection by automatic disconnection of supply shall be provided by means of an overcurrent protective
device in each line conductor or by an RCD, and all exposed-conductive-parts of the reduced low voltage system
shall be connected to Earth. The earth fault loop impedance at every point of utilization, including socket-outlets,
shall be such that the disconnection time does not exceed 5 s.

Where a circuit-breaker is used, the maximum value of earth fault loop impedance (Zs ) shall be determined by the
formula in Regulation 411.4.4. Alternatively, the values specified in Table 41.6 may be used instead of calculation
for the nominal voltages (Uo ) and the types and ratings of overcurrent device listed therein.

Where a fuse is used, the maximum values of earth fault loop impedance (Zs ) corresponding to a disconnection time
of 5 s are stated in Table 41.6 for nominal voltages (Uo ) of 55 V and 63.5 V.




                                                                                                                                  73
413.1.2        Except as permitted by Regulation 413.1.3, this protective measure shall be limited to the supply of
one item of current-using equipment supplied from one unearthed source with simple separation.
NOTE: When this protective measure is used, it is particularly important that the basic insulation complies with the relevant
      product standard.

413.1.3        Where more than one item of current-using equipment is supplied from an unearthed source with
simple separation, the requirements of Regulation 418.3 shall be met.

413.2          Requirements for basic protection

All electrical equipment shall be subject to one of the basic protective provisions in Section 416 or to the protective
measures in Section 412.

413.3          Requirements for fault protection

413.3.1         Protection by electrical separation shall comply with Regulations 413.3.2 to 413.3.6.

413.3.2         The separated circuit shall be supplied through a source with at least simple separation, and the
voltage of the separated circuit shall not exceed 500 V.

413.3.3         Live parts of the separated circuit shall not be connected at any point to another circuit or to Earth or
to a protective conductor.

For electrical separation, arrangements shall be such that basic insulation is achieved between circuits in compliance
with Regulation 416.1.

413.3.4         Flexible cables shall be visible throughout any part of their length liable to mechanical damage.

413.3.5         For separated circuits the use of separate wiring systems is recommended. If separated circuits and
other circuits are in the same wiring system, multi-conductor cables without metallic covering, insulated conductors
in insulating conduit, insulating ducting or insulating trunking shall be used, provided that:
   (i) the rated voltage is not less than the highest nominal voltage, and
  (ii) each circuit is protected against overcurrent.

413.3.6       The exposed-conductive-parts of the separated circuit shall not be connected either to the protective
conductor or exposed-conductive-parts of other circuits, or to Earth.
NOTE: If the exposed-conductive-parts of the separated circuit are liable to come into contact, either intentionally or
      fortuitously, with the exposed-conductive-parts of other circuits, protection against electric shock no longer
      depends solely on protection by electrical separation but also on the protective provisions to which the latter
      exposed-conductive-parts are subject.

414           PROTECTIVE MEASURE: EXTRA-LOW VOLTAGE PROVIDED BY SELV OR PELV

414.1          General

414.1.1        Protection by extra-low voltage is a protective measure which consists of either of two different
extra-low voltage systems:
   (i) SELV, or
  (ii) PELV.

Protection by extra-low voltage provided by SELV or PELV requires:
  (iii) limitation of voltage in the SELV or PELV system to the upper limit of voltage Band I, 50 V AC or
        120 V DC (see BS EN 61140), and
  (iv) protective separation of the SELV or PELV system from all circuits other than SELV and PELV circuits, and
       basic insulation between the SELV or PELV system and other SELV or PELV systems, and
  (v)   for SELV systems only, basic insulation between the SELV system and Earth.

414.1.2        The use of SELV or PELV according to Section 414 is considered as a protective measure in all
situations.
NOTE: In certain cases Part 7 limits the value of the extra-low voltage to a value lower than 50 V AC or 120 V DC.




                                                                                                                                77
414.2           Requirements for basic protection and fault protection

Both basic protection and fault protection are deemed to be provided where:
   (i) the nominal voltage cannot exceed the upper limit of voltage Band I, and
  (ii) the supply is from one of the sources listed in Regulation 414.3, and
 (iii) the conditions of Regulation 414.4 are fulfilled.
NOTE 1 : If the system is supplied from a higher voltage system by equipment which provides at least simple separation between
         that system and the extra-low voltage system but which does not meet the requirements for SELV and PELV sources
         in Regulation 414.3, the requirements for FELV may be applicable, see Regulation 411.7.
NOTE 2: DC voltages for ELV circuits generated by a semiconductor convertor (see BS EN 60146-2) require an internal
        AC voltage circuit to supply the rectifier stack. This internal AC voltage exceeds the DC voltage. The internal
        AC circuit is not to be considered as a higher voltage circuit within the meaning of this regulation. Between internal
        circuits and external higher voltage circuits, protective separation is required.
NOTE 3: In DC systems with batteries, the battery charging and floating voltages exceed the battery nominal voltage, depending
        on the type of battery. This does not require any protective provisions in addition to those specified in this regulation.
        The charging voltage should not exceed a maximum value of 75 V AC or 150 V DC as appropriate according to the
        environmental situation as given in Table 1 of PD 6536 (IEC 61201).

414.3           Sources for SELV and PELV

The following sources may be used for SELV and PELV systems:
   (i) A safety isolating transformer in accordance with BS EN 61558-2-6 or BS EN 61558-2-8
  (ii) A source of current providing a degree of safety equivalent to that of the safety isolating transformer specified
       in (i) (e.g. motor-generator with windings providing equivalent isolation)
 (iii) An electrochemical source (e.g. a battery) or another source independent of a higher voltage circuit (e.g. a
       diesel-driven generator)
  (iv) Certain electronic devices complying with appropriate standards, where provisions have been taken such
       that, even in the case of an internal fault, the voltage at the outgoing terminals cannot exceed the values
       specified in Regulation 414.1.1. Higher voltages at the outgoing terminals are, however, permitted where, in
       case of contact with a live part or in the event of a fault between a live part and an exposed-conductive-part,
       the voltage at the output terminals is immediately reduced to the value specified in Regulation 414.1.1 or less.
         NOTE 1 : Examples of such devices include insulation testing equipment and monitoring devices.
         NOTE 2: Where higher voltages exist at the outgoing terminals, compliance with this regulation may be assumed if
                 the voltage at the outgoing terminals is within the limits specified in Regulation 414.1.1 when measured with
                 a voltmeter having an internal resistance of at least 3 000 ohms.

A mobile source supplied at low voltage, e.g. a safety isolating transformer or a motor-generator, shall be selected
and erected in accordance with the requirements for protection by the use of double or reinforced insulation
(see Section 412).

414.4           Requirements for SELV and PELV circuits

414.4.1          SELV and PELV circuits shall have:
   (i) basic insulation between live parts and other SELV or PELV circuits, and
  (ii) protective separation from live parts of circuits not being SELV or PELV, provided by double or reinforced
       insulation or by basic insulation and protective screening for the highest voltage present.

SELV circuits shall have basic insulation between live parts and Earth.

The PELV circuits and/or exposed-conductive-parts of equipment supplied by the PELV circuits may be earthed.
NOTE 1 : In particular, protective separation is necessary between the live parts of electrical equipment such as relays, contactors
         and auxiliary switches, and any part of a higher voltage circuit or a FELV circuit.
NOTE 2 : The earthing of PELV circuits may be achieved by a connection to Earth or to an earthed protective conductor within
         the source itself.
414.4.2        Protective separation of wiring systems of SELV or PELV circuits from the live parts of other circuits,
which have at least basic insulation, shall be achieved by one of the following arrangements:
   (i) SELV and PELV circuit conductors enclosed in a non-metallic sheath or insulating enclosure in addition to
       basic insulation
  (ii) SELV and PELV circuit conductors separated from conductors of circuits at voltages higher than Band I by
       an earthed metallic sheath or earthed metallic screen
 (iii) Circuit conductors at voltages higher than Band I may be contained in a multi-conductor cable or other
       grouping of conductors if the SELV and PELV conductors are insulated for the highest voltage present
 (iv) The wiring systems of other circuits are in compliance with Regulation 412.2.4.1
  (v) Physical separation.

414.4.3       Every socket-outlet and luminaire supporting coupler in a SELV or PELV system shall require the
use of a plug which is not dimensionally compatible with those used for any other system in use in the same
premises.

Plugs and socket-outlets in a SELV system shall not have a protective conductor contact.

414.4.4        Exposed-conductive-parts of SELV circuits shall not be connected to Earth, or to protective
conductors or exposed-conductive-parts of another circuit.
NOTE: If the exposed-conductive-parts of SELV circuits are liable to come into contact, either fortuitously or intentionally,
      with the exposed-conductive-parts of other circuits, protection against electric shock no longer depends solely on
      protection by SELV, but also on the protective provisions to which the latter exposed-conductive-parts are subject.

414.4.5        If the nominal voltage exceeds 25 V AC or 60 V DC or if the equipment is immersed, basic protection
shall be provided for SELV and PELV circuits by:
   (i) insulation in accordance with Regulation 416.1
  (ii) barriers or enclosures in accordance with Regulation 416.2.

Basic protection is generally unnecessary in normal dry conditions for:
   (i) SELV circuits where the nominal voltage does not exceed 25 V AC or 60 V DC
  (ii) PELV circuits where the nominal voltage does not exceed 25 V AC or 60 V DC and exposed-conductive-
       parts and/or the live parts are connected by a protective conductor to the main earthing terminal.

In all other cases, basic protection is not required if the nominal voltage of the SELV or PELV system does not
exceed 12 V A C or 30 V DC.

415           ADDITIONAL PROTECTION
NOTE: Additional protection in accordance with Section 415 may be specified with the protective measure. In particular,
      additional protection may be required with the protective measure under certain conditions of external influence and
      in certain special locations (see the corresponding section of Part 7).

415.1          Additional protection: RCDs
415.1.1         The use of RCDs with a rated residual operating current not exceeding 30 mA is recognized in
AC systems as additional protection in the event of failure of the provision for basic protection and/or the provision
for fault protection or carelessness by users.

415.1.2        The use of RCDs is not recognized as a sole means of protection and does not obviate the need to
apply one of the protective measures specified in Sections 411 to 414.

415.2          Additional protection: supplementary protective equipotential bonding
NOTE1 : Supplementary protective equipotential bonding is considered as an addition to fault protection.
NOTE 2: The use of supplementary protective equipotential bonding does not exclude the need to disconnect the supply for
        other reasons, for example protection against fire, thermal stresses in equipment, etc.
NOTE 3: Supplementary protective equipotential bonding may involve the entire installation, a part of the installation, an item
        of equipment, or a location.
NOTE 4: Additional requirements may be necessary for special locations (see the corresponding section of Part 7), or for other
        reasons.

415.2.1        Supplementary protective equipotential bonding shall include all simultaneously accessible
exposed-conductive-parts of fixed equipment and extraneous-conductive-parts including where practicable the main
metallic reinforcement of constructional reinforced concrete. The supplementary protective equipotential bonding
system shall be connected to the protective conductors of all equipment including those of socket-outlets.




                                                                                                                                  79
417.3.3       In places where bulky or long conductive objects are normally handled, the distances required by
Regulations 417.3.1 and 417.3.2 shall be increased, taking account of the relevant dimensions of those objects.

418            PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR APPLICATION ONLY WHERE THE INSTALLATION
               IS CONTROLLED OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF SKILLED OR INSTRUCTED
               PERSONS
NOTE:     The conditions of supervision under which the fault protective provisions of Section 418 may be applied as part of the
          protective measure are given in Regulation 410.3.6.

418.1           Non-conducting location
This method of protection is not recognized for general application.
NOTE:     This protective measure is intended to prevent simultaneous contact with parts which may be at different potentials
          through failure of the basic insulation of live parts.

418.1.1          All electrical equipment shall comply with one of the provisions for basic protection described in
Section 416.
418.1.2       Exposed-conductive-parts shall be arranged so that under ordinary circumstances persons will not
come into simultaneous contact with:
   (i) two exposed-conductive-parts, or
  (ii) an exposed-conductive-part and any extraneous-conductive-part
if these parts are liable to be at different potentials through failure of the basic insulation of a live part.
418.1.3         In a non-conducting location there shall be no protective conductor.
418.1.4        Regulation 418.1.2 is fulfilled if the location has an insulating floor and walls and one or more of the
following arrangements applies:
   (i) Relative spacing of exposed-conductive-parts and of extraneous-conductive-parts as well as spacing of
       exposed-conductive-parts
        This spacing is sufficient if the distance between two parts is not less than 2.5 m; this distance may be reduced
        to 1.25 m outside the zone of arm’s reach.
  (ii) Interposition of effective obstacles between exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts
         Such obstacles are sufficiently effective if they extend the distances to be surmounted to the values stated
         in point (i) above. They shall not be connected to Earth or to exposed-conductive-parts; as far as possible
         they shall be of insulating material.
 (iii) Insulation or insulating arrangements of extraneous-conductive-parts.
        The insulation shall be of sufficient mechanical strength and be able to withstand a test voltage of at least
        2 000 V. Leakage current shall not exceed 1 mA in normal conditions of use.
418.1.5         The resistance of insulating floors and walls at every point of measurement under the conditions
specified in Part 6 shall be not less than:
   (i) 50 kQ, where the nominal voltage of the installation does not exceed 500 V, or
  (ii) 100 k£2, where the nominal voltage of the installation exceeds 500 V.
NOTE:     If at any point the resistance is less than the specified value, the floors and walls are deemed to be extraneous-
          conductive-parts for the purposes of protection against electric shock.

418.1.6       The arrangements made shall be permanent and it shall not be possible to make them ineffective. The
arrangements shall also provide protection where the use of mobile equipment is envisaged.
NOTE 1: Attention is drawn to the risk that, where electrical installations are not under effective supervision, further conductive
        parts may be introduced at a later date (e.g. mobile Class I equipment, or extraneous-conductive-parts such as metallic
        water pipes), which may invalidate compliance with Regulation 418.1.6.
NOTE 2 : It is essential that the insulation of floors and walls cannot be affected by humidity.

418.1.7        Precautions shall be taken so that extraneous-conductive-parts cannot cause a potential to appear
within the vicinity of the location concerned.

418.2           Protection by earth-free local equipotential bonding
This method of protection shall be used only in special circumstances.
NOTE:     Earth-free local equipotential bonding is intended to prevent the appearance of a dangerous touch voltage.

418.2.1          All electrical equipment shall comply with one of the provisions for basic protection described in
Section 416.
418.2.2        Protective bonding conductors shall interconnect every simultaneously accessible exposed-
conductive-part and extraneous-conductive-part.

418.2.3       The local protective bonding conductors shall neither be in electrical contact with Earth directly, nor
through exposed-conductive-parts, nor through extraneous-conductive-parts.
NOTE: Where this requirement cannot be fulfilled, protection by automatic disconnection of supply is applicable
      (see Section 411).

418.2.4         Precautions shall be taken so that persons entering the equipotential location cannot be exposed to a
dangerous potential difference, in particular, where a conductive floor insulated from Earth is connected to the earth-
free protective bonding conductors.
418.2.5        Where this measure is applied, a warning notice complying with Regulation 514.13.2 shall be fixed
in a prominent position adjacent to every point of access to the location concerned.

418.3          Electrical separation for the supply to more than one item of current-using
               equipment
Where the measure is used to supply two or more items of equipment from a single source, a warning notice
complying with Regulation 514.13.2 shall be fixed in a prominent position adjacent to every point of access to the
location concerned.
NOTE: Electrical separation of an individual circuit is intended to prevent shock currents through contact with exposed-
      conductive-parts that may be energized by a fault in the basic insulation of the circuit.

418.3.1         All electrical equipment shall comply with one of the provisions for basic protection described in
Section 416.
418.3.2       Protection by electrical separation for the supply to more than one item of equipment shall be achieved
by compliance with all the requirements of Section 413 except Regulation 413.1.2, and with the requirements in
Regulations 418.3.3 to 418.3.8.
418.3.3         Precautions shall be taken to protect the separated circuit from damage and insulation failure.
418.3.4       The exposed-conductive-parts of the separated circuit shall be connected together by insulated,
non-earthed protective bonding conductors. Such conductors shall not be connected to the protective conductor or
exposed-conductive-parts of any other circuit or to any extraneous-conductive-parts.
NOTE: See Note to Regulation 413.3.6.

418.3.5        Every socket-outlet shall be provided with a protective conductor contact which shall be connected
to the equipotential bonding system provided in accordance with Regulation 418.3.4.
418.3.6      Except where supplying equipment with double or reinforced insulation, all flexible cables shall
embody a protective conductor for use as a protective bonding conductor in accordance with Regulation 418.3.4.
41 8.3.7        If two faults affecting two exposed-conductive-parts occur and these are fed by conductors of different
polarity, a protective device shall disconnect the supply in a disconnection time conforming with Table 41.1.
418.3.8        The product of the nominal voltage of the circuit in volts and length of the wiring system in metres
shall not exceed 100 000 Vm, and the length of the wiring system shall not exceed 500 m.

419            PROVISIONS WHERE AUTOMATIC DISCONNECTION ACCORDING TO
               REGULATION 411.3.2 IS NOT FEASIBLE
419.1           Where automatic disconnection is not feasible in circumstances where:
   (i) electronic equipment with limited short-circuit current is installed, or
  (ii) the required disconnection times cannot be achieved by a protective device
the provisions of Regulations 419.2 and 419.3 are applicable.
419.2           For installations with power electronic convertors with nominal voltage U o greater than 50 V AC or
120 V DC and where automatic disconnection is not feasible, the output voltage of the source shall be reduced to
50 V AC or 120 V DC or less in the event of a fault between a live conductor and the protective conductor or Earth
in a time as given in Regulation 411.3.2.2, 411.3.2.3 or 411.3.2.4, as appropriate (see BS EN 62477-1).
The power electronic convertor shall be one for which the manufacturer gives adequate methods for the initial
verification and periodic inspection and testing of the installation.
419.3          Except where Regulation 419.2 applies, if automatic disconnection cannot be achieved in the time
required by Regulation 411.3.2.2, 411.3.2.3 or 411.3.2.4 as appropriate, supplementary protective equipotential
bonding shall be provided in accordance with Regulation 415.2 and the voltage between simultaneously accessible
exposed-conductive-parts and/or extraneous-conductive-parts shall not exceed 50 V AC or 120 V DC.
                                                                                                                           83

420.1          Scope
This chapter applies to electrical installations and equipment with regard to measures for the protection of persons,
livestock and property against:
    (i)   the harmful effects of heat or thermal radiation developed by electrical equipment
   (ii)   the ignition, combustion or degradation of materials
  (iii)   flames and smoke where a fire hazard could be propagated from an electrical installation to other nearby fire
          compartments, and
  (iv)    safety services being cut off by the failure of electrical equipment.
NO T E 1 : For protection against thermal effects and fire, statutory requirements may be applicable. Refer to Appendix 2.
NOTE 2: Protection against overcurrent is dealt with in Chapter 43 of these Regulations.

421            PROTECTION AGAINST FIRE CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT

421.1           General requirements
421.1.1       Persons, livestock and property shall be protected against harmful effects of heat or fire which may
be generated or propagated in electrical installations.
Manufacturers’ instructions shall be taken into account in addition to the requirements of BS 7671.
NO T E 1 : Harmfid effects of heat or fire may be caused by:
              - heat accumulation, heat radiation, hot components or equipment
              - failure of electrical equipment such as protective devices, switchgear, thermostats, temperature limiters, seals of
                cable penetrations and wiring systems
              - overcurrent
              - insulation faults or arcs, sparks and high temperature particles
              - harmonic currents
              - external influences such as lightning surge
              - inappropriate selection or erection of equipment.
NOTE 2: Lightning strikes and overvoltages are covered in BS EN 62305 and Section 443 of these Regulations.
421.1.2         Fixed electrical equipment shall be selected and erected such that its temperature in normal operation
will not cause a fire. This shall be achieved by the construction of the equipment or by additional protective measures
taken during erection.

The heat generated by electrical equipment shall not cause danger or harmful effects to adjacent fixed material or to
material which may foreseeably be in proximity to such equipment.

Where fixed equipment may attain surface temperatures which could cause a fire hazard to adjacent materials, one
or more of the following installation methods shall be adopted. The equipment shall:
   (i) be mounted on a support which has low thermal conductance or within an enclosure which will withstand,
       with minimal risk of fire or harmful thermal effect, such temperatures as may be generated, or
  (ii) be screened by materials of low thermal conductance which can withstand, with minimal risk of fire or
       harmful thermal effect, the heat emitted by the electrical equipment, or
  (iii) be mounted so as to allow safe dissipation of heat and at a sufficient distance from adjacent material on
        which such temperatures could have deleterious effects. Any means of support shall be of low thermal
        conductance.

421.1.3         Where arcs, sparks or particles at high temperature may be emitted by fixed equipment in normal
service, the equipment shall meet one or more of the following requirements. It shall be:
   (i) totally enclosed in arc-resistant material
  (ii) screened by arc-resistant material from materials upon which the emissions could have harmful effects
  (iii) mounted so as to allow safe extinction of the emissions at a sufficient distance from materials upon which
        the emissions could have harmful effects
  (iv) in compliance with its standard.

Arc-resistant material used for this protective measure shall be of low ignitability in accordance with
BS EN ISO 11925-2, of low thermal conductivity and of adequate thickness to provide mechanical stability.

421.1.4        Fixed equipment causing a concentration and focusing of heat shall be at a sufficient distance from
any fixed object or building element so that the object or element is not subjected to a dangerous temperature in
normal conditions.

421.1.5       Where electrical equipment in a single location contains flammable liquid in significant quantity,
adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent the spread of liquid, flame and the products of combustion.
NOTE 1 : Examples of such precautions are:
          (a) a retention pit of sufficient size to collect any leakage of liquid and provide extinction in the event of fire
          (b) installation of the equipment in a chamber of adequate fire-resistance and the provision of sills or other means
              of preventing burning liquid spreading to other parts of the building, such a chamber being ventilated solely to
              the external atmosphere.
NOTE 2: The generally accepted lower limit for a significant quantity is 25 litres.
NOTE 3: For quantities less than 25 litres, it is sufficient to take precautions to prevent the escape of liquid.
NOTE 4: Products of combustion of liquid are considered to be smoke and gas.

421.1.201    Within domestic (household) premises, consumer units and similar switchgear assemblies shall
comply with BS EN 61439-3 and shall:
   (i) have their enclosure manufactured from non-combustible material, or
  (ii) be enclosed in a cabinet or enclosure constructed of non-combustible material and complying with
       Regulation 132.12.
NOTE: Ferrous metal, e.g. steel, is deemed to be an example of a non-combustible material.

421.1.6         Materials used for the construction of enclosures of electrical equipment shall comply with the
resistance to heat and fire requirements in an appropriate product standard.

Where no product standard exists, the materials of an enclosure shall withstand the highest temperature likely to be
produced by the electrical equipment in normal use.




                                                                                                                                 85
NOTE 2 : Generally, this means cables in a protected escape route should be limited to lighting and associated accessories,
         emergency lighting and fire detection and alarm systems, although cables for other safety systems may be necessary.
         Hospitals may have special requirements as detailed in Section 710.

422.2.1           Only cables that meet the following requirements shall be installed in protected escape routes:
        (i) cables meeting the requirements of 560.8.1 or cables with resistance to flame propagation according to the
            recommended requirements of the relevant part of BS EN 60332-3 series or, where cable management
            systems according to (iii) or (iv) below are used, to the recommended requirements of BS EN 60332-1-2
            and
       (ii) a minimum of 60 % light transmittance when tested in accordance with BS EN 61034-2.

Cables in protected escape routes shall be as short as practicable. Cables encroaching on escape routes shall not be
installed within arm’s reach unless they are provided with protection against mechanical damage likely to occur
during an evacuation.

Where used in protected escape routes, cable management systems shall be one or more of the following types and
shall be of limited smoke production so as not to inhibit escape:
      (iii) conduit systems classified as non-flame propagating according to BS EN 61386
      (iv) cable trunking systems and cable ducting systems classified as non-flame propagating according to
           BS EN 50085
       (v) cable tray and cable ladder systems classified as non-flame propagating according to BS EN 61537
      (vi) powertrack systems meeting the requirements of BS EN 61534.
NOTE 1 : Non-fire resisting cables need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire.
         See Appendix 2, item 17. There are no requirements in the CPR for fire resisting cables described in Regulation 560.8.
NOTE 2: Ferrous metal, e.g. steel, is deemed to be an example of a material having limited smoke production.

Cables that are supplying safety circuits shall have a resistance to fire rating of either the time authorized by
regulations for building elements or British Standards for the circuits or one hour in the absence of such a regulation
or standard. Refer to Regulation 560.8 for such cables.

422.2.2       Switchgear or controlgear shall be accessible only to authorized persons. If switchgear or
controlgear is placed in an escape route, it shall be enclosed in a cabinet or an enclosure constructed of
non-combustible or not readily combustible material.

These requirements do not apply to items of switchgear or controlgear installed to facilitate evacuation, such as fire
alarm call points.

422.2.3           In protected escape routes the use of electrical equipment containing flammable liquids is not
permitted.

This requirement does not apply to individual capacitors incorporated in equipment, such as a capacitor installed in
a discharge luminaire or a motor starter.

422.3            Locations with risks of fire due to the nature of processed or stored materials

The requirements of this regulation shall be applied in addition to those of Section 421 in locations where BE2
conditions exist.

This regulation does not apply to selection and erection of installations in locations with explosion risks, see
BS EN 60079-14 and BS EN 61241-14.
NOTE 1 : BE2 conditions exist where there is a risk of fire due to the manufacture, processing or storage of flammable materials
         including the presence of dust (see Appendix 5).
NOTE 2: Examples of locations presenting BE2 conditions include bams (due to the accumulation of dust and fibres),
        woodworking facilities, paper mills and textile factories (due to the storage and processing of combustible materials).
NOTE 3: Quantities of flammable materials or the surface or volume of the location may be regulated by national authorities.

422.3.1          Except for equipment for which an appropriate product standard specifies requirements, a luminaire

422.3.9         Wiring systems, other than mineral insulated cables, busbar trunking systems or powertrack systems,
shall be protected against insulation faults:
   (i) in a TN or TT system, by an RCD having a rated residual operating current (I An) not exceeding 300 mA
       according with Regulation 531.3.2 and to relevant product standards.

Where a resistive fault may cause a fire, e.g. for overhead heating with heating film elements, the rated residual
operating current shall not exceed 30 mA.
  (ii) in an IT system, by an insulation monitoring device with audible and visual signals provided in accordance
       with Regulation 538.1. Disconnection times in the event of a second fault are given in Chapter 41.
       Alternatively, RCDs with a rated residual operating current as specified in (i) may be used. In the event of a
       second fault, see Chapter 41 for disconnection times.

422.3.10       Circuits supplying or traversing locations where BE2 conditions exist shall be protected against
overload and against fault current by protective devices located outside and on the supply side of these locations.
Circuits originating inside these locations shall be protected against overcurrent by protective devices located at
their origin.

422.3.203       A heat storage appliance shall be of a type which prevents the ignition of combustible dusts or fibres
by the heat storing core.

422.4          Combustible constructional materials
The requirements of this regulation shall be applied in addition to those of Section 421 in locations where CA2
conditions exist.
NOTE: CA2 conditions exist where a building is mainly constructed of combustible materials, such as wood
      (see Appendix 5).

422.4.1        Precautions shall be taken so that electrical equipment does not ignite walls, floors or ceilings. In
prefabricated hollow walls containing a pre-installed wiring system including accessories, all boxes and enclosures
shall have a degree of protection of at least IP3X where the wall is liable to be drilled during erection.




                                                                                                                            89
     422.4.2          Except for equipment for which an appropriate product standard specifies requirements, a luminaire
     shall be kept at an adequate distance from combustible materials. Unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer,
     a small spotlight or projector shall be installed at the following minimum distance from combustible materials:

         (i) Rating up to 100 W                       0.5 m
        (ii) Over 100 and up to 300 W                 0.8 m
      (iii)   Over 300 and up to 500 W                1.0 m.

     Lamps and other components of luminaires shall be protected against foreseeable mechanical stresses. Such
     protective means shall not be fixed to lampholders unless they form an integral part of the luminaire or are fitted in
     accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
     A luminaire with a lamp that could eject flammable materials in case of failure shall be constructed with a safety
     protective shield for the lamp in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
     NOTE:     Refer to Table 55.3 regarding the marking of luminaires and their installation or mounting on normally flammable
               surfaces.

     422.4.201     Electrical equipment, e.g. installation boxes and distribution boards, installed on or in a combustible
     wall shall comply with the relevant standard for enclosure temperature rise.
     422.4.202      Electrical equipment that does not comply with Regulation 422.4.201 shall be enclosed with a
     suitable thickness of non-flammable material. The effect of the material on the heat dissipation from electrical
     equipment shall be taken into account.
     422.4.203       Cables shall comply with the requirements of BS EN 60332-1-2.
     NOTE:     Cables also need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire. See Appendix 2, item 17.

     422.4.204      Conduit and trunking systems shall be in accordance with BS EN 61386-1 and BS EN 50085-1
     respectively and shall meet the fire-resistance tests within these standards.

     422.5          Fire propagating structures
     The requirements of this regulation shall be applied in addition to those of Section 421 in locations where CB2
     conditions exist. Where the risk of flame propagation is high the cable shall meet the requirements of the appropriate
     part of BS EN 60332-3 series.
     NOTE 1 : CB2 conditions relate to the propagation of fire and exist where a building has a shape and dimensions which facilitate
               the spread of fire (e.g. chimney effect), such as high-rise buildings or where a building has a forced ventilation system
               (see Appendix 5).
     NOTE 2: Fire detectors may be provided to activate measures for preventing propagation of fire, for example, the closing of
               fireproof shutters in ducts, troughs or trunking.
     NOTE 3: Boxes and enclosures according to BS EN 60670-1 and BS EN 61439 series for use in hollow walls can be used.
     NOTE 4 : Cables also need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire. See Appendix 2, item 17.

     422.5.1         In structures where the shape and dimensions are such as will facilitate the spread of fire, precautions
     shall be taken so that the electrical installation does not propagate a fire (e.g. chimney effect).

     422.6          Selection and erection of installations in locations of national, commercial,
                    industrial or public significance
     The requirements of Regulation 422.1 shall          apply to locations that include buildings or rooms with assets of
     significant value. Examples include national        monuments, museums and other public buildings. Buildings such
     as railway stations and airports are generally      considered to be of public significance. Buildings or facilities such
     as laboratories, computer centres and certain       industrial and storage facilities can be of commercial or industrial
     significance.
     The following measures may be considered:
        (i) Installation of mineral insulated cables according to BS EN 60702
       (ii) Installation of cables with improved fire-resisting characteristics in case of a fire hazard, such as those
            complying with BS 7629-1, BS 7846 or BS 8592
       (iii) Installation of cables in non-combustible solid walls, ceilings and floors
       (iv) Installation of cables in areas with constructional partitions having a fire-resisting capability for a time of
            30 minutes or 90 minutes, the latter in locations housing staircases and needed for an emergency escape.
     Where these measures are not practicable improved fire protection may be possible by the use of reactive fire
     protection systems.

                          PROTECTION AGAINST OVERCURRENT
430           INTRODUCTION

430.1          Scope
This chapter provides requirements for the protection of live conductors from the effects of overcurrent.

This chapter describes how live conductors are protected by one or more devices for the automatic disconnection
of the supply in the event of overload current (Section 433) and fault current (Section 434), except in cases where
the overcurrent is limited in accordance with Section 436 or where the conditions described in Regulation 433.3
(omission of devices for protection against overload) or Regulation 434.3 (omission of devices for protection against
fault current) are met. Coordination of overload current protection and fault current protection is also covered
(Section 435).
NOTE 1 : Live conductors protected against overload current in accordance with Section 433 are also considered to be protected
         against faults likely to cause overcurrents of a magnitude similar to overload currents.
NOTE 2: The requirements of this chapter do not take account of external influences.
NOTE 3: Protection of conductors according to these regulations does not necessarily protect the equipment connected to the
         conductors.
NOTE 4: Disconnection does not necessarily mean isolation in this chapter.

430.2          Not used

430.3          General requirement
A protective device shall be provided to break any overcurrent in the circuit conductors before such a current could
cause a danger due to thermal or mechanical effects detrimental to insulation, connections, joints, terminations or
the surroundings of the conductors.

The protection against overload current and the protection against fault current shall be coordinated in accordance
with Section 435.
NOTE: An overcurrent may be an overload current or a fault current.

431           PROTECTION ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE CIRCUITS AND THE
              DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

431.1          Protection of line conductors
431.1.1        Except where Regulation 431.1.2 applies, detection of overcurrent shall be provided for all line
conductors and shall cause the disconnection of the conductor in which the overcurrent is detected, but not necessarily
the disconnection of the other line conductors except where the disconnection of one line conductor could cause
damage or danger.

If disconnection of a single line conductor may cause danger, for example in the case of a three-phase motor,
appropriate precautions shall be taken.

431.1.2        In a TN or TT system, for a circuit supplied between line conductors and in which the neutral
conductor is not distributed, overcurrent detection need not be provided for one of the line conductors, provided that
both the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled:
   (i) There exists, in the same circuit or on the supply side, differential protection intended to detect unbalanced
       loads and cause disconnection of all the line conductors, and
  (ii) the neutral conductor is not distributed from an artificial neutral point of the circuits situated on the load side
       of the differential protective device mentioned in (i).

431.2          Protection of the neutral conductor
431.2.1        TN orTT system

The neutral conductor shall be protected against short-circuit current.

Where the cross-sectional area of the neutral conductor is at least equivalent to that of the line conductors, and
the current in the neutral is not expected to exceed the value in the line conductors, it is not necessary to provide
overcurrent detection for the neutral conductor or a disconnecting device for that conductor.




                                                                                                                                 93
432.4          Characteristics of protective devices
The time/current characteristics of an overcurrent protective device shall comply with those specified in
BS 88 series, BS 3036, BS EN 60898, BS EN 60947-2 or BS EN 61009-1.

The use of another device is not precluded provided that its time/current characteristics provide a level of protection
not less than that given by the devices listed above.

433           PROTECTION AGAINST OVERLOAD CURRENT

433.1          Coordination between conductor and overload protective device
Every circuit shall be designed so that a small overload of long duration is unlikely to occur.

433.1.1       The operating characteristics of a device protecting a conductor against overload shall satisfy the
following conditions:
   (i) The rated current or current setting of the protective device (In ) is not less than the design current (Ib ) of the
       circuit, and
  (ii) the rated current or current setting of the protective device (In ) does not exceed the lowest of the
       current-carrying capacities (Iz ) of any of the conductors of the circuit, and
  (iii) the current (I2 ) causing effective operation of the protective device does not exceed 1.45 times the lowest of
        the current-carrying capacities (I z ) of any of the conductors of the circuit.

For adjustable protective devices, the rated current (In ) is the current setting selected.

The current (I 2 ) causing effective operation of the protective device is given in the product standard or may be
provided by the manufacturer.
NOTE 1 : Where overload protection is provided by BS 3036 fuses, refer to Regulation 433.1.202.
NOTE 2: Protection in accordance with this regulation may not provide protection in all cases, for example, where sustained
         overcurrents less than I2 occur.

433.1.201      Where the protective device is a general-purpose type (gG) fuse toBS 88-2, a fuse to BS 88-3, a
circuit-breaker to BS EN 60898, a circuit-breaker to BS EN 60947-2 or a residual current circuit-breaker with
integral overcurrent protection (RCBO) to BS EN 61009-1, compliance with conditions (i) and (ii) also results in
compliance with condition (iii) of Regulation 433.1.1.

433.1.202       Where the protective device is a semi-enclosed fuse to BS 3036 compliance with condition (iii) of
Regulation 433.1.1 is afforded if its rated current (In ) does not exceed 0.725 times the current-carrying capacity (I z )
of the lowest rated conductor in the circuit protected.

433.1.203         For direct buried cables or cables in buried ducts where the tabulated current-carrying capacity is
based on an ambient temperature of 20 °C compliance with condition (iii) of Regulation 433.1.1 is afforded if the
rated current or current setting of the protective device (I n) does not exceed 0.9 times the current-carrying capacity
(I z ) of the lowest rated conductor in the circuit protected.

433.1.204      Accessories to BS 1363 may be supplied through a ring final circuit, with or without unfused spurs,
protected by a 30 A or 32 A protective device complying with BS 88 series, BS 3036, BS EN 60898, BS EN 60947-2
or BS EN 61009-1 (RCBO). The circuit shall be wired with copper conductors having line and neutral conductors
with a minimum cross-sectional area of 2.5 mm2 except for two-core mineral insulated cables complying with
BS EN 60702-1, for which the minimum cross-sectional area is 1.5 mm2. Such circuits are deemed to meet the
requirements of Regulation 433.1.1 if the current-carrying capacity (Iz ) of the cable is not less than 20 A and if,
under the intended conditions of use, the load current in any part of the circuit is unlikely to exceed for long periods
the current-carrying capacity (Iz ) of the cable.

433.2          Position of devices for protection against overload
433.2.1          Except where Regulation 433.2.2 or 433.3 applies, a device for protection against overload shall be
installed at the point where a reduction occurs in the value of the cun-ent-carrying capacity of the conductors of the
installation.
NOTE: A reduction in current-carrying capacity may be due to a change in cross-sectional area, method of installation, type
      of cable or conductor, or in environmental conditions.




                                                                                                                              95
433.2.2          The device protecting a conductor against overload may be installed along the run of that conductor
if the part of the run between the point where a change occurs (in cross-sectional area, method of installation, type
of cable or conductor, or in environmental conditions) and the position of the protective device has neither branch
circuits nor outlets for connection of current-using equipment and fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
   (i) It is protected against fault current in accordance with the requirements stated in Section 434
  (ii) Its length does not exceed 3 m, it is installed in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fault to a minimum,
       and it is installed in such a manner as to reduce to a minimum the risk of fire or danger to persons
       (see also Regulation 434.2.1).

433.3          Omission of devices for protection against overload
This regulation shall not be applied to installations situated in locations presenting a fire risk or risk of explosion or
where the requirements for special installations and locations specify different conditions.

433.3.1        General

A device for protection against overload need not be provided:
   (i) for a conductor situated on the load side of the point where a reduction occurs in the value of
       current-carrying capacity, where the conductor is effectively protected against overload by a protective
       device installed on the supply side of that point
  (ii) for a conductor which, because of the characteristics of the load or the supply, is not likely to carry overload
       current, provided that the conductor is protected against fault current in accordance with the requirements
       of Section 434
  (iii) at the origin of an installation where the distributor provides an overload device and agrees that it affords
        protection to the part of the installation between the origin and the main distribution point of the installation
        where further overload protection is provided.

433.3.2        Position or omission of devices for protection against overload in IT systems

433.3.2.1       The provisions in Regulations 433.2.2 and 433.3 for an alternative position or omission of devices
for protection against overload are not applicable to IT systems unless each circuit not protected against overload is
protected by one of the following means:
   (i) Use of the protective measures described in Regulation 413.2
  (ii) An RCD that will operate immediately on the second fault
 (iii) For permanently supervised systems only, the use of an insulation monitoring device which either:
        (a) causes the disconnection of the circuit when the first fault occurs, or
        (b) gives a signal indicating the presence of a fault. The fault shall be corrected in accordance with
            operational requirements and recognition of the consequences of a second fault.

433.3.2.2       In an IT system without a neutral conductor it is permitted to omit the overload protective device in
one of the line conductors if an RCD is installed in each circuit.

433.3.3        Omission of devices for protection against overload for safety reasons

The omission of devices for protection against overload is permitted for circuits supplying current-using equipment
where unexpected disconnection of the circuit could cause danger or damage.

Examples of such circuits are:
   (i) the exciter circuit of a rotating machine
  (ii) the supply circuit of a lifting magnet
 (iii) the secondary circuit of a current transformer
  (iv) a circuit supplying a fire extinguishing device
  (v) a circuit supplying a safety service, such as a fire alarm or a gas alarm
  (vi) a circuit supplying medical equipment used for life support in specific medical locations where an IT system
       is incorporated.
NOTE:     Tn such situations consideration should be given to the provision of an overload alarm.
433.4           Overload protection of conductors in parallel
Where a single protective device protects two or more conductors in parallel there shall be no branch circuits or
devices for isolation or switching in the parallel conductors.
This regulation does not preclude the use of ring final circuits with or without spur connections.

433.4.1         Equal current sharing between parallel conductors
Except for a ring final circuit, where spurs are permitted, where a single device protects conductors in parallel
and the conductors are sharing currents equally, the value of Iz to be used in Regulation 433.1.1 is the sum of the
current-carrying capacities of the parallel conductors.
The measures to be taken to achieve equal current sharing are given in Regulation 523.7 (i).

433.4.2         Unequal current sharing between parallel conductors
Where the use of a single conductor is impractical and the currents in the parallel conductors are unequal, the design
current and requirements for overload protection for each conductor shall be considered individually.
NOTE:      Currents in parallel conductors are considered to be unequal if the difference between the currents is more than 10 %
           of the design current for each conductor. Refer to paragraph 2 of Appendix 10.

434            PROTECTION AGAINST FAULT CURRENT
This section only considers the case of a fault between conductors belonging to the same circuit.

434.1           Determination of prospective fault current
The prospective fault current shall be determined at every relevant point of the installation. This shall be done by
calculation, measurement or enquiry.

434.2           Position of devices for protection against fault current
A device providing protection against fault current shall be installed at the point where a reduction in the
cross-sectional area or other change causes a reduction in the current-carrying capacity of the conductors, except
where Regulation 434.2.1, 434.2.2 or 434.3 applies.

The requirements in Regulations 434.2.1 and 434.2.2 shall not be applied to installations situated in locations
presenting a fire risk or risk of explosion or where special requirements for certain locations specify different
conditions.

434.2.1         Except where Regulation 434.2.2 or 434.3 applies, a device for protection against fault current may
be installed other than as specified in Regulation 434.2, under the following conditions:

In the part of the conductor between the point of reduction of cross-sectional area or other change and the position
of the protective device there shall be no branch circuits or socket-outlets and that part of the conductor shall:
   (i) not exceed 3 m in length, and
  (ii) be installed in such a manner as to reduce the risk of fault to a minimum, and
          NOTE: This condition may be obtained, for example, by reinforcing the protection of the wiring against external
                influences.
  (iii) be installed in such a manner as to reduce to a minimum the risk of fire or danger to persons.

434.2.2          The device protecting a conductor may be installed on the supply side of the point where a change
occurs (in cross-sectional area, method of installation, type of cable or conductor, or in environmental conditions)
provided that it possesses an operating characteristic such that it protects the wiring situated on the load side against
fault current, in accordance with Regulation 434.5.2.

434.3          Omission of devices for protection against fault current
A device for protection against fault current need not be provided for:
   (i) a conductor connecting a generator, transformer, rectifier or an accumulator battery to the associated control
       panel where the protective device is placed in the panel
  (ii) a circuit where disconnection could cause danger for the operation of the installation concerned, such as
       those quoted in Regulation 433.3.3
 (iii) certain measuring circuits
  (iv)   the origin of an installation where the distributor installs one or more devices providing protection against
         fault current and agrees that such a device affords protection to the part of the installation between the origin
         and the main distribution point of the installation where further protection against fault current is provided,


                                                                                                                                   97
436          LIMITATION OF OVERCURRENT BY THE CHARACTERISTICS                          OF THE SUPPLY

Conductors are considered to be protected against overload current and fault current where they are supplied from a
source incapable of supplying a current exceeding the current-carrying capacity of the conductors (e.g. certain bell
transformers, certain welding transformers and certain types of thermoelectric generating set).

                 PROTECTION AGAINST VOLTAGE DISTURBANCES
440             INTRODUCTION

440.1           Scope

These requirements are intended to provide for the safety of electrical installations in the event of voltage disturbances
and electromagnetic disturbances generated due to different specified causes.

The requirements are not intended to apply to systems for distribution of energy to the public, or to power generation
and transmission for such systems, although such disturbances may be conducted into or between electrical
installations via these supply systems. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to those of Chapter 43.

440.2           General

This chapter covers the protection of electrical installations and measures against voltage disturbances and
electromagnetic disturbances. The requirements are arranged into four sections as follows:
    (i) Section 442      Protection of low voltage installations against temporary overvoltages due to earth faults
                         in the high voltage system and due to faults in the low voltage system

   (ii)   Section 443         Protection against overvoltages of atmospheric origin or due to switching
  (iii)   Section 444         Measures against electromagnetic disturbances
  (iv)    Section 445         Protection against undervoltage.


441            NOT USED

442            PROTECTION OF LOW VOLTAGE INSTALLATIONS AGAINST TEMPORARY
               OVERVOLTAGES DUE TO EARTH FAULTS IN THE HIGH VOLTAGE SYSTEM AND DUE
               TO FAULTS IN THE LOW VOLTAGE SYSTEM

442.1           Scope and object

This regulation provides requirements for the safety of the low voltage installation in the event of:
   (i) a fault between the high voltage system and Earth in the transformer substation that supplies the low voltage
       installation
  (ii) loss of the supply neutral in the low voltage system
  (iii) short-circuit between a line conductor and neutral in the low voltage installation
  (iv)    accidental earthing of a line conductor of a low voltage IT system.
NOTE:      The requirements for the earthing of transformers that provide a supply from a system for distribution of electricity in
           accordance with the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations (ESQCR) are addressed in the Distribution
           Code.
442.1.1         General

Section 442 gives rules for the designer and installer of the substation. It is necessary to have the following
information on the high voltage system:
   (i) Quality of the system earthing
  (ii) Maximum level of earth fault current
 (iii) Resistance of the earthing arrangement.

The following regulations consider four situations which generally cause the most severe temporary overvoltages:
  (iv) Fault between the high voltage system(s) and Earth (see Regulation 442.2)
  (v) Loss of the neutral in a low voltage system (see Regulation 442.3)
 (vi) Accidental earthing of a low voltage IT system (see Regulation 442.4)
 (vii) Short-circuit in the low voltage installation (see Regulation 442.5).
443.4          Overvoltage control

443.4.1         Transient overvoltages due to the effects of indirect lightning strokes

Protection against transient overvoltages shall be provided where the consequence caused by the overvoltage could
result in:
   (i) serious injury to, or loss of, human life
  (ii) failure of a safety service, as defined in Part 2
  (iii) significant financial or data loss.

For all other cases, protection against transient overvoltages shall be provided unless the owner of the installation
declares it is not required due to any loss or damage being tolerable and they accept the risk of damage to equipment
and any consequential loss.

443.4.2        Transient overvoltages caused by equipment

Protection against overvoltages shall be considered in the case of equipment likely to produce switching overvoltages
or disturbances exceeding the applicable rated impulse voltage of equipment according to Table 443.2, e.g. where
inductive or capacitive equipment, such as motors, transformers, capacitor banks, storage units or high current loads
are installed.

443.6          Classification of rated impulse voltages (overvoltage categories)

443.6.1        Purpose of classification of rated impulse voltages (overvoltage categories)

Overvoltage categories are defined within electrical installations for the purpose of insulation coordination and a
related classification of equipment with rated impulse voltages is provided (see Table 443.2).

The rated impulse voltage is used to classify equipment energized directly from the low voltage electrical installation
into overvoltage categories.

Rated impulse voltages for equipment selected according to the nominal voltage are provided to distinguish different
levels of availability of equipment with regard to continuity of service and an acceptable risk of failure.

Inherent overvoltage control for insulation coordination, based only on the rated impulse voltage of the equipment
in accordance with BS EN IEC 60664-1, is not sufficient where:
    -   transient overvoltages transmitted via the supply distribution system are not significantly attenuated
        downstream
          NOTE: Insulation coordination can be achieved in the whole installation by transient overvoltage protection of
                the equipment corresponding to the classified rated impulse voltage, thereby reducing the risk of failure to
                an acceptable level.
    - surge currents and partial lightning currents are distributed via underground cables
    - equipment is connected to multiple services, e.g. power, telecommunications and data lines.

It is necessary to consider the rated impulse voltage U w (see BS EN IEC 60664-1) of the most sensitive equipment
to be protected in the system or, in cases where a temporary loss of function of equipment is unacceptable, the
impulse immunity voltage (see BS EN 61000-4-5).

443.6.2        Rated impulse voltages of equipment and overvoltage categories

Category IV equipment is suitable for use at, or in the proximity of, the origin of the electrical installation, for
example, upstream of the main distribution board. Equipment of category IV has a very high impulse withstand
capability providing the required high degree of reliability, and shall have a rated impulse voltage not less than the
value specified in Table 443.2.


                                                                                                                               107

                    GUIDANCE ON OVERVOLTAGECONTROL BY
                       SPDs APPLIED TO OVERHEAD LINES
Where an installation is supplied by, or includes, an overhead line and SPDs are required according to
Regulation Group 443.4, the protective control of the overvoltage level may be obtained either by installing surge
protective devices directly in the installation close to the origin of the installation or, with the consent of the network
operator, in the overhead lines of the supply distribution network.

As an example, the following measures may be applied:
   (a) in the case of overhead supply distribution networks, overvoltage protection is erected at network junction
       points and especially at the end of each feeder longer than 0.5 km. Surge protective devices should be
       erected at every 0.5 km distance along the supply distribution lines. Nevertheless, the distance between
       surge protective devices should in no case exceed 1 km
   (b) if a supply distribution network is erected partly as an overhead network and partly as an underground
       network, overvoltage protection in the overhead lines should be applied in accordance with (a) at each
       transition point from an overhead line to an underground cable
   (c) in a TN distribution network supplying electrical installations, where the protective measure automatic
       disconnection of supply is applied, the earthing conductors of the surge protective devices connected to the
       line conductors are connected to the PEN conductor or to the PE conductor
   (d) in a TT distribution network supplying electrical installations, where the protective measure automatic
       disconnection of supply is applied, surge protective devices are provided for the line conductors and for the
       neutral conductor. At the place where the neutral conductor of the supply network is effectively earthed, a
       surge protective device for the neutral conductor is not necessary.

444           MEASURES AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES

444.1          Scope
This section provides basic requirements and recommendations to enable the avoidance and reduction of
electromagnetic disturbances.

Those involved in the design, installation and maintenance of, and alterations to, electrical installations shall give
due consideration to the measures described in this section.

Electromagnetic disturbances can disturb or damage information and communications technology systems or
information and communications technology equipment as well as equipment with electronic components or
circuits. Currents due to lightning, switching operations, short-circuits and other electromagnetic phenomena might
cause overvoltages and electromagnetic interference.

These effects are potentially more severe:
   (i) where large metal loops exist
  (ii) where different electrical wiring systems are installed in common routes, e.g. for power supply and for
       signalling and/or data communication cables connecting information and communications technology
       equipment within a building.
The value of the induced voltage depends on the rate of change (dl/dt) of the interference current and on the size of
the loop.

Power cables carrying large currents with a high rate of change of current (dl/dt) (e.g. the starting current of lifts or
currents controlled by rectifiers) can induce overvoltages in cables of information and communications technology
systems, which can influence or damage information and communications technology equipment or similar electrical
equipment.

In or near rooms for medical use, electromagnetic disturbances associated with electrical installations can interfere
with medical electrical equipment.

The requirements and recommendations given in this section can have an influence on the overall design of the
building including its structural aspects.
The requirements of the following standards shall be applied where appropriate:
 (iii) BS 6701: Telecommunications equipment and telecommunications cabling. Specification for installation,
       operation and maintenance
  (iv)   BS EN 50310: Telecommunications bonding networks for buildings and other structures

                                                                                                                              109

      444.4          Electromagnetic disturbances

      444.4.1        Sources of electromagnetic disturbances

      Consideration shall be given to the location of the sources of electromagnetic disturbances relative to the positioning
      of other equipment. Potential sources of electromagnetic disturbances within an installation typically include:
         (i) switching devices for inductive loads
        (ii) electric motors
        (iii) fluorescent lighting
        (iv)   welding machines
         (v) rectifiers
        (vi) choppers
       (vii) frequency convertors/regulators including Variable Speed Drives (VSDs)
      (viii) lifts
        (ix) transformers
        (x) switchgear
        (xi) power distribution busbars.
      NOTE:     For further information refer to the BS EN 50174 series of standards.

      444.4.2        Measures to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI)

      444.4.2.1     The following measures shall be considered, where appropriate, in order to reduce the effects of
      electromagnetic interference:
         (i)   Where screened signal or data cables are used, care should be taken to limit the fault current from power
               systems flowing through the screens and cores of signal cables, or data cables, which are earthed. Additional
               conductors may be necessary, e.g. a bypass conductor for screen reinforcement, see Figure 44.4

          Fig 44.4 - Bypass conductor for screen reinforcement to provide a common equipotential
                                              bonding system




        (ii) The use of surge protective devices and/or filters to improve electromagnetic compatibility with regard to
             conducted electromagnetic phenomena for electrical equipment sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances
       (iii) The installation of power cables (i.e. line, neutral and any protective earth conductors) close together in
             order to minimize cable loop areas
       (iv)    The separation of power and signal cables
        (v)    The installation of an equipotential bonding network, see Regulation 444.5.2.

      444.4.3        TN system

      To minimize electromagnetic disturbances, the following requirements shall be met.

      444.4.3.1       A PEN conductor shall not be used downstream of the origin of the installation.
      NOTE:     Regulation 8(4) of the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations (ESQCR) prohibits the use of PEN
                conductors in consumers’ installations.

444.4.4       TT system

In an installation forming part of a TT system, such as that shown in Figure 44.7, consideration shall be
given to overvoltages which might exist between live parts and extraneous-conductive-parts where the
extraneous-conductive-parts of different buildings are connected to different earth electrodes.

The use of an isolating transformer to provide a TN-S system shall be considered.

Where screened signal cables or data cables are common to several buildings supplied from an installation forming
part of a TT system, the use of a bypass bonding conductor (see Figure 44.8) or single-point bonding shall be
considered. The bypass conductor shall have a minimum cross-sectional area of 16 mm2 copper or equivalent, the
equivalent cross-sectional area being selected in accordance with Regulation 544.1.

Where the live conductors of the supply into any of the buildings exceed 35 mm 2 in cross-sectional area the bypass
conductor shall have a minimum cross-sectional area in accordance with Table 54.8.




                                                                                                                      113

      If consent according to the last paragraph of Regulation 411.3.1.2 (telecommunication cables) cannot be obtained,
      it is the responsibility of the owner or operator of the cable to avoid any danger due to the exclusion of those cables
      from the connection to the main equipotential bonding.

      444.4.6        Multiple-source TN or TT power supplies

      For TN or TT multiple-source power supplies to an installation, the system shall be earthed at one point only.

      For a TN system, to avoid having the neutral current flowing through the protective conductor, a single point of
      connection only shall be made as illustrated in Figure 44.9.

         Fig 44.9 - TN multiple-source power supply with single connection between PEN and earth




      NOTE 1 : Where multiple earthing of the star points of the sources of supply is applied, neutral conductor currents might flow
               back to the relevant star point, not only via the neutral conductor, but also via the protective conductor as shown in
               Figure 44.10. For this reason the sum of the partial currents flowing in the installation is no longer zero and a stray
               magnetic field is created, similar to that of a single conductor cable.
      NOTE 2: In the case of a single conductor cable carrying AC current, a circular electromagnetic field is generated around the
              conductor that might interfere with electronic equipment. Harmonic currents produce similar electromagnetic fields
              but they attenuate more rapidly than those produced by the fundamental current.

444.4.7        Transfer of supply

In an installation forming part of a TN system the transfer from one supply to an alternative supply shall be by means
of a multipole switching device which switches the line conductors and the neutral conductor, if any.
NOTE: This method prevents electromagnetic fields due to stray currents in the main supply system of an installation.

444.4.9        Separate buildings

Where different buildings have separate equipotential bonding systems, metal-free optical fibre cables or other non
conducting systems are preferred for signal and data transmission, e.g. microwave signal transformer for isolation
in accordance with BS EN 61558-2-1, 2-4, 2-6, 2-15 and either BS EN 60950-1 or BS EN 62368-1.

444.4.10       Inside buildings

Within a building, the requirements and recommendations of the following standards shall be applied for control,
signalling and communication circuits:
   (i) BS EN 50174-1: Information technology - Cabling installation: Installation specification and quality
       assurance
  (ii) BS EN 50174-2: Information technology - Cabling installation: Installation planning and practices inside
       buildings

444.5.1        Interconnection of earth electrodes

444.5.1.1      Within a single building

All protective and functional earthing conductors of an installation within a building shall be connected to the
main earthing terminal, as required by Regulation 542.4.1, except where this is precluded by the requirements of
legislation or Part 7.

444.5.1.2      Between buildings
For communication and data exchange between several buildings, the requirements of Regulation 542.1.3.3 apply
to both the protective and functional earthing requirements.
NOTE: Where interconnection of the earth electrodes is not possible or practicable, it is recommended that separation of
      communications networks is applied, for example, by using optical or radio links.




                                                                                                                           115
      444.5.2        Equipotential bonding networks

      The structure selected for these conductors shall be appropriate for the installation:
         (i) Metal sheaths, screens or armouring of cables shall be bonded to the common bonding network (CBN)
             unless such bonding is required to be omitted for safety reasons
        (ii)   Where screened signal or data cables are earthed, care shall be taken to limit the fault current from power
               systems flowing through the screens and cores of signal cables or data cables
        (iii) The impedance of equipotential bonding connections intended to carry functional earth currents having high
              frequency components shall be as low as practicable and this should be achieved by the use of multiple,
              separated bonds that are as short as possible
                NOTE: Where bonds of up to 1 metre long are used, their inductive reactance and impedance of route can be reduced
                         by choosing a conductive braid or a bonding strap/strip (with a width to thickness ratio of at least 5:1 and a
                         length to width ratio no greater than 5:1).
        (iv) Where a lightning protection system is installed, reference shall be made to BS EN 62305.

      444.5.3        Sizing and installation of copper bonding ring network conductors
      Equipotential bonding designed as a bonding ring network shall have the following minimum nominal dimensions:
         (i) Flat cross-section: 25 mm x 3 mm
        (ii) Round diameter: 8 mm.

      Bare conductors shall be protected against corrosion at their supports and on their passage through walls.

      444.5.3.1      Parts to be connected to the equipotential bonding network
      The following parts shall be connected to the equipotential bonding network:
         (i) Metallic containment, conductive screens, conductive sheaths or armouring of data transmission cables or
             of information and communications technology equipment
        (ii) Functional earthing conductors of antenna systems
        (iii) Conductors of the earthed pole of a DC supply for information and communications technology equipment
        (iv) Functional earthing conductors
        (v)    Protective conductors.

      444.5.7.1      Earthing busbar
      Where an earthing busbar is required for functional purposes, consideration shall be given to extending the main
      earthing terminal of the building by using one or more earthing busbars. This enables information and communications
      technology installations to be connected to the main earthing terminal by the shortest practicable route from any point
      in the building. Where the earthing busbar is erected to support the equipotential bonding network of a significant
      amount of information and communications technology equipment in a building, consideration shall be given to the
      installation of a bonding ring conductor or common mesh bonding network; see Annex A444 Figure A444.2.

      Consideration shall be given to the need for accessibility of the earthing busbar throughout its length and to the
      protection of bare conductors to prevent corrosion.

      444.5.7.2      Cross-sectional area of the earthing busbar
      For installations connected to a supply having a capacity of 200 A per phase or more, the cross-sectional area
      of the earthing busbar shall be not less than 50 mm 2 copper and shall be selected in accordance with Regulation
      444.5.2(iii).

      For supplies having a capacity of less than 200 A per phase the earthing busbar shall be selected in accordance with
      Table 54.8.

      Where the earthing busbar is used as part of a DC return current path, its cross-sectional area shall be selected
      according to the expected DC return currents.

444.6.1       General

Cables that are used at voltage Band II (low voltage) and cables that are used at voltage Band I (extra-low voltage)
which share the same cable management system or the same route, shall be installed according to the requirements
of Regulations 528.1 and 528.2. Circuits of the same voltage band might also require segregation or separation.

Electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility might produce different segregation or separation requirements.
The design shall meet both requirements.

444.6.2       Equipment

The minimum distance between information and communications technology cables and discharge, neon and
mercury vapour (or other high-intensity discharge) lamps shall be 130 mm. In this regard, low energy lamps (cfl)
are to be considered as gas discharge sources. Data wiring racks and electrical equipment shall always be separated.

      MEASURES AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC      DISTURBANCES

A444.1        Structures for the network of bonding conductors and earthing conductors
For dwellings, where normally a limited amount of electronic equipment is in use, a protective conductor network
in the form of a star network might be acceptable.

For commercial and industrial buildings and similar buildings containing multiple electronic applications, a
common equipotential bonding system is useful in order to comply with the EMC requirements of different types
of equipment.

The four basic structures described as follows might be used, depending on the importance and vulnerability of
equipment.
NOTE:    For further information, the methodology referred to in BS EN 50310 (Telecommunications bonding networks for
         buildings and other structures) is generally applicable.

A444.1.1      Protective conductors in a star network
This type of network is applicable to small installations associated with dwellings, small commercial buildings,
etc., and from a general point of view to equipment that is not interconnected by signal cables; see Figure A444.1.

A444.1.2      Multiple meshed bonding star network
This type of network is applicable to small installations with different small groups of interconnected communicating
equipment. It enables the local dispersion of currents caused by electromagnetic interference; see Figure A444.2.
      A444.1.4      Protective conductors connected to a bonding ring conductor
      An equipotential bonding network in the form of a bonding ring conductor (BRC) is shown in Figure A444.4
      on the top floor of the structure. The BRC should preferably be made of copper, bare or insulated, and installed
      in such a manner that it remains accessible everywhere, e.g. by mounting on a cable tray, in a metallic conduit
      (see BS EN 61386 series), employing a surface mounted method of installation or cable trunking. All protective
      and functional earthing conductors may be connected to the BRC.

      A444.2       Equipotential bonding networks in buildings with several floors
      For buildings with several floors, it is recommended that, on each floor, an equipotential bonding system be
      installed; see Figure A444.4 for examples of bonding networks in common use; each floor is a type of network.
      The bonding systems of the different floors should be interconnected, at least twice, by conductors selected in
      accordance with the requirements of Chapter 54.

                                           protection system




      A444.3       Installations containing a high density of interconnected equipment
      In severe electromagnetic environments, it is recommended that the common meshed bonding star network
      described in A444.1.3 be adopted.

A444.4        Design guidelines for segregation of circuits
Where both the specification of the information technology cable and its intended application is known, the
requirements of BS EN 50174-2 and BS EN 50174-3 are appropriate.

BS EN 50174 series standards contain requirements and recommendations for the installation of information
technology cabling which support a range of applications delivering the following services:
   (i) ICT (information and communications technology) e.g. local area networks
  (ii) BCT (broadcast communication technologies) e.g. audio-visual, television
  (iii) CCCB (command control and communications in buildings) e.g. building automation
  (iv) PMCA (process monitoring, control and automation) e.g. industrial networks (Fieldbus).

Where the specification and/or intended application of the information technology cable is not available, then the
cable separation distance between the power and information technology cables should be a minimum of 200 mm
in free air.

This distance can be reduced if a screened power cable, a metallic barrier, or containment system is used as
described in Table A444.1.

 TABLE A444.1 - Summary of minimum separation distances where the specification and/or the intended
                   application of the information technology cable is not available

 These recommendations of segregation are based upon the following assumptions:
    (i) The electromagnetic environment complies with the levels defined in the BS EN 61000-6 series of
        standards for conducted and radiated disturbances (e.g. mains power cabling)
   (ii) The LV supply is non-deformed but has high-frequency content consistent with the switching and operation
        of connected equipment in accordance with the BS EN 61000-6 series of standards
          NOTE: “Deformed” LV power supplies and the use of other equipment lie outside the scope of BS 7671 and
                    might require additional engineering practices.
   (iii) The total design current in the LV circuits does not exceed 600 A
   (iv) Balanced information technology/telecommunications cables have electromagnetic immunity performance
        in accordance with BS EN 50288 series standards for Category 5 and above
    (v) Coaxial information technology/telecommunications cables have electromagnetic immunity performance
        in accordance with BS EN 50117-4-1 standard for Category BCT-C
   (vi) The applications supported by the cabling are designed to operate using the information technology
        cabling installed or to be installed.

 NOTE 1: Screening performance (DC-lOOMHz) equivalent to welded mesh steel basket of mesh size 50 mm x 100 mm
           (excluding ladders). This screening performance is also achieved with steel tray (duct without cover) of less than
           1.0 mm wall thickness and more than 20 % equally distributed perforated area. No part of the cable within the
           containment should be less than 10 mm below the top of the barrier.
 NOTE 2: Screening performance (DC-100 MHz) equivalent to steel tray (duct without cover) of 1.0 mm wall thickness and
           no more than 20 % equally distributed perforated area. This screening performance is also achieved with screened
           power cables that do not meet the performance defined in Note 1. No part of the cable within the containment should
           be less than 10 mm below the top of the barrier.
 NOTE 3: Screening performance (DC-100 MHz) equivalent to a fully enclosed steel containment system having a minimum
           wall thickness of 1.5 mm. Separation specified is in addition to that provided by any divider/barrier.
 NOTE 4: No physical separation other than that provided by the containment.
NOTE: Zero segregation in the Table references additional segregation/separation for EMC over and above the requirements
          for safety. Safety considerations must always take precedence over EMC requirements.

Where the above conditions do not apply, see Table A444.2.

NOTE 2: The worst-case separation based on voltage or current should be used.

Additional areas of concern are expressed in Regulation 444.4.1.
The minimum separation between the information technology cables and mains power cables includes all
allowances for cable movement between their fixing points or other restraints (see example in Figure A444.5).

                              Fig A444.5 - Example of cable separation distance

                                      Separation




The minimum separation requirement applies in three dimensions. However, where information technology
cables and mains power cables are required to cross and required minimum separation cannot be maintained then
maintaining the angle of their crossing at 90 degrees on either side of the crossing for a distance no less than the
applicable minimum separation requirement will minimize any electromagnetic disturbances.

445           PROTECTION AGAINST UNDERVOLTAGE

445.1          General requirements
445.1.1        Suitable precautions shall be taken where a reduction in voltage, or loss and subsequent restoration
of voltage, could cause danger. Provisions for a circuit supplying a motor shall comply with Regulation 552.1.3.
Where current-using equipment or any other part of the installation may be damaged by a drop in voltage and it is
verified that such damage is unlikely to cause danger, one of the following arrangements shall be adopted:
   (i) Suitable precautions against the damage foreseen shall be provided
  (ii) It shall be verified, in consultation with the person or body responsible for the operation and maintenance
         of the installation, that the damage foreseen is an acceptable risk.
445.1.2        A suitable time delay may be incorporated in the operation of an undervoltage protective device if
the operation of the equipment to which the protection relates allows without danger a brief reduction or loss of
voltage.
445.1.3        Any delay in the opening or reclosing of a contactor shall not impede instantaneous disconnection
by a control device or a protective device.
445.1.4        The characteristics of an undervoltage protective device shall be compatible with the requirements
for starting and use of the equipment to which the protection relates, as stated in the appropriate British or

                                    ISOLATION AND SWITCHING
460           SCOPE

Chapter 46 deals with:
   (i) non-automatic local and remote isolation and switching measures for the prevention or removal of dangers
       associated with electrical installations or electrically powered equipment, and
  (ii) switching for the control of circuits or equipment.

Where electrically powered equipment is within the scope of BS EN 60204, only the requirements of that standard
apply.

461           GENERAL

461 .1         According to the intended function(s), every device provided for isolation or switching shall comply
with the relevant requirements of Chapter 53.

461.2           In TN-C systems and TN-C-S systems, the PEN conductor shall not be isolated or switched.

In TN-C-S and TN-S systems, isolation or switching of the neutral conductor is not required if protective equipotential
bonding is installed and either:
   (i)   the neutral conductor is reliably connected to Earth by a low resistance to meet the disconnection times of
         the protective devices according to the requirements of Chapter 41, or
  (ii) the distributor declares that either the PEN or the neutral conductor of the supply is reliably connected
       to Earth by a low resistance to meet the disconnection times of the protective devices according to the
       requirements of Chapter 41.

462           ISOLATION

462.1           Each electrical installation shall have provisions for isolation from each supply.

462.1.201       A main linked switch or linked circuit-breaker shall be provided as near as practicable to the origin
of every installation as a means of switching the supply on load and as a means of isolation.

A main switch intended for operation by ordinary persons, e.g. of a household or similar installation, shall interrupt
both live conductors of a single-phase supply.

462.2         Every circuit shall be provided with isolation means for all live conductors, except as detailed in
Regulation 461.2.

Provision may be made for isolating a group of circuits by a common means, if the service conditions allow this.
462.3            Devices for isolationshall be designed and/or installed so as to prevent unintentional or inadvertent closure.

Examples of precautions are as follows:
      -   Located within a lockable space or lockable enclosure
      - Padlocking
      -   Located adjacent to the associated equipment.

462.4            Where residual electrical energy is potentially present, suitable means shall be provided for its discharge.

Where relevant, a warning label indicating the discharge time required before the enclosure can be safely opened
shall be provided.
NOTE:      Storage units do not need to be discharged since they are considered to be supply sources.

463            FUNCTIONAL SWITCHING (CONTROL)

463.1           General
463.1.1       Functional switching shall be provided for each part of a circuit which may require to be controlled
independently of other parts of the installation.

463.1.2         Functional switching devices need not necessarily switch off all live conductors of a circuit.
A single-pole switching device shall not be placed in the neutral conductor except for the connection of the control
device for lighting circuits as shown in Figure 46.1.

Key
      1 connection of the control device for lighting circuits
      2 circuit supplying the lamps
      3 control device.

Switching of the neutral shall be in compliance with Regulation 530.3.3.

463.1.3        In general, all current-using equipment requiring control shall be controlled by an appropriate
functional switching device.

A single functional switching device may control several items of current-using equipment intended to operate
simultaneously.

463.1.4          Functional switching devices ensuring the changeover of supply from alternative sources shall switch
off all live conductors and shall not be capable of putting the sources in parallel, unless the installation is specifically
designed for this condition.


                                                                                                                                  125
      463.2          Auxiliary circuits

      Auxiliary circuits shall be designed, arranged and protected to limit dangers resulting from a fault in the auxiliary
      circuit or an insulation fault between the auxiliary circuit and other conductive parts liable to cause malfunction
      (e.g. inadvertent operation) of the controlled apparatus; see Section 557.

      463.3          Motor control

      463.3.1        Motor control circuits shall be designed so as to prevent any motor from restarting automatically
      after a stoppage due to a fall in or loss of voltage, if such starting is liable to cause danger.

      Earth faults in control circuits should not cause unintentional starting, potentially hazardous motion, or prevent
      stopping of the motor.

      463.3.2         Where reverse-current braking of a motor is provided, provision shall be made for the avoidance of
      reversal of the direction of rotation at the end of braking if such reversal may cause danger.

      463.3.3        Where safety depends on the direction of rotation of a motor, provision shall be made for the
      prevention of reverse operation due to a reversal of phases.
      NOTE:     Attention is drawn to danger which may arise from the loss of one phase.

      464           SWITCHING OFF FOR MECHANICAL MAINTENANCE

      464.1          Means for switching off shall be provided where mechanical maintenance may involve a risk of
      physical injury.

      The switching off shall cause the disconnection of all live conductors, except as provided in Regulation 46 1.2, by a
      device suitable for isolation.
      NOTE 1 : Electrically powered mechanical equipment may include rotating machines as well as heating elements and
               electromagnetic equipment.
      NOTE 2: Systems powered by other means, e.g. pneumatic, hydraulic or steam, are not covered by these regulations. In such
               cases, switching off any associated supply of electricity may not be a sufficient measure.
      NOTE 3: Where electrically powered equipment is within the scope of BS EN 60204, the requirements for switching off for
               mechanical maintenance of that standard apply.

      464.2          Suitable means shall be provided to prevent electrically powered equipment from inadvertently or
      unintentionally reactivating during mechanical maintenance, unless the means of switching off is continuously
      under the control of any person performing such maintenance.

      465           EMERGENCY SWITCHING OFF

      465.1          Means shall be provided for emergency switching off of any part of an installation where it may be
      necessary to control the supply to remove an unexpected danger.

      465.2           Where a risk of electric shock or another risk of electrical origin is involved, the emergency switching
      off shall cause the disconnection of all live conductors, except as provided in Regulation 461.2, by a device suitable
      for isolation.

      465.3          Means for emergency switching off shall act as directly as possible on the appropriate supply conductors.

      The arrangement for emergency switching off shall be such that one single action only will interrupt the appropriate
      supply.

      465.4          The arrangement of the emergency switching shall be such that its operation does not introduce a
      further danger or interfere with the complete operation necessary to remove the danger.
      NOTE: The operation of the switching device is to be understood as switching off in case of emergency and switching on to
            re-energize the relevant circuit.

      The emergency operation function shall not impair the effectiveness of protective devices or of devices with other
      safety functions.

                                                 COMMON RULES
510           INTRODUCTION

510.1          General

This chapter deals with the selection of equipment and its erection. It provides common rules for compliance with
measures of protection for safety, requirements for proper functioning for intended use of the installation, and
requirements appropriate to the external influences.

510.2          Not used

510.3            Every item of equipment shall be selected and erected so as to allow compliance with the regulations
stated in this chapter and the relevant regulations in other parts of BS 7671 and shall take account of manufacturers’
instructions.

511           COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS

511.1          Every item of equipment shall comply with the relevant requirements of the applicable British or
Harmonized Standard, appropriate to the intended use of the equipment. The edition of the standard shall be the
current edition, with those amendments pertaining at a date to be agreed by the parties to the contract concerned
(see Appendix 1).

Alternatively, if equipment complying with a foreign national standard based on an IEC Standard is to be used, the
designer or other person responsible for specifying the installation shall verify that any differences between that
standard and the corresponding British or Harmonized Standard will not result in a lesser degree of safety than that
afforded by compliance with the British or Harmonized Standard. Such use shall be recorded on the appropriate
electrical certification specified in Part 6.
NOTE 1 : As a minimum, an appropriate foreign national standard should define relevant safety parameters, together with test
         criteria and requirements. For some products, for instance cables, these include the constructional details.
NOTE 2: The use of foreign national standards not based on an IEC Standard, and/or not compatible with the safety provisions
        of BS 7671, is not recommended.

511.2           Where equipment to be used is not covered by a British or Harmonized Standard or is to be used
outside the scope of its standard, the designer or other person responsible for specifying the installation shall confirm
that the equipment provides at least the same degree of safety as that afforded by compliance with BS 7671. Such
use shall be recorded on the appropriate electrical certification specified in Part 6.
NOTE:     An assessment of compliance with BS 7671 in respect of the degree of safety afforded would be expected to consider
          all the same criteria as in Note 1 to Regulation 511.1. This also applies to private specifications not containing the same
          criteria as in Note 1 to Regulation 511.1.


512           OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS AND EXTERNAL INFLUENCES

512.1          Operational conditions

512.1.1        Voltage

Every item of equipment shall be suitable for the nominal voltage (Uo) of the installation or the part of the installation
concerned, where necessary taking account of the highest and/or lowest voltage likely to occur in normal service. In
an IT system, equipment shall be insulated for the nominal voltage between lines.

512.1.2        Current

Every item of equipment shall be suitable for:
   (i) the design current, taking into account any capacitive and inductive effects, and
  (ii) the current likely to flow in abnormal conditions for such periods of time as are determined by the
       characteristics of the protective devices concerned.

512.1.3        Frequency

If frequency has an influence on the characteristics of the equipment, the rated frequency of the equipment shall
correspond to the nominal frequency of the supply to the circuit concerned.
512.1.4        Power

Every item of equipment selected on the basis of its power characteristics shall be suitable for the duty demanded
of the equipment.

512.1.5        Compatibility

Every item of equipment shall be selected and erected so that it will neither cause harmful effects to other equipment
nor impair the supply during normal service including switching operations.

Switchgear, protective devices, accessories and other types of equipment shall not be connected to conductors
intended to operate at a temperature exceeding 70 °C at the equipment in normal service unless the equipment
manufacturer has confirmed that the equipment is suitable for such conditions. The 70 °C limit is met if the live
conductor size is chosen based on the current rating for 70 °C cables of similar construction.

See also Regulation 526.2 concerning electrical connections, Regulations 523.1 and 536.4.202 and Table 4A3.

The designer of the fixed installation shall verify that the installed fixed equipment, where relevant, is designed
and manufactured in accordance with the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2016 and, upon request,
the responsible person for the fixed installation shall provide the required documentation as specified by the
Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations.
NOTE 1: Information on the parameters to be considered is given in Section 444. The level of detail of the documentation
        may vary from very simple information to much more detailed documentation for complex installations involving
        important potential EMC aspects.
NOTE 2: The responsible person referred to in this regulation is as defined in the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations
        2016 as the installer.
NOTE 3: Where the current rating is to be based on 70 °C, current-carrying capacities given in Tables 4D1 to 4D5 or 4H1 to
        4H4 of Appendix 4 may be used for 90 °C thermosetting insulated cables.

512.1.6        Impulse withstand voltage

Equipment shall be selected so that its impulse withstand voltage is at least equal to the required minimum impulse
withstand voltage according to the overvoltage category at the point of installation as defined in Section 443.

512.2          External influences

512.2.1         Equipment shall be of a design appropriate to the situation in which it is to be used or its mode of
installation shall take account of the conditions likely to be encountered.

512.2.2         If the equipment does not, by its construction, have the characteristics relevant to the external
influences of its location, it may nevertheless be used on condition that it is provided with appropriate additional
protection in the erection of the installation. Such protection shall not adversely affect the operation of the equipment
thus protected.

512.2.3         Where different external influences occur simultaneously, they may have independent or mutual
effects and the degree of protection shall be provided accordingly.

512.2.4         The selection of equipment according to external influences is necessary not only for proper
functioning, but also for the reliability of the measures of protection for safety complying with BS 7671 generally.
Measures of protection afforded by the construction of equipment are valid only for the given conditions of external
influence if the corresponding equipment specification tests are made in these conditions of external influence.
NOTE: For the purpose of BS 7671, the following classes of external influence are conventionally regarded as normal:

          AA Ambient temperature                     AA4
          AB Atmospheric humidity                    AB4
          Other environmental conditions             XXI of each parameter
          (AC to AS)
          Utilization and construction               XXI of each parameter, except
          of buildings (B and C)                     XX2 for the parameter BC


513           ACCESSIBILITY
513.1           Except for a joint in cables where Section 526 allows such a joint to be inaccessible, every item of
equipment shall be arranged so as to facilitate its operation, inspection and maintenance and access to each connection.
Such facility shall not be significantly impaired by mounting equipment in an enclosure or a compartment.


                                                                                                                               131

A bare conductor shall be identified, where necessary, by the application of tape, sleeve or disc of the appropriate
colour prescribed in Table 51 or by painting with such a colour.

514.5         Identification of conductors by letters and/or numbers

514.5.1        The lettering or numbering system applies to identificationof individual conductors and of conductors
in a group. The identification shall be clearly legible and durable. All characters shall be in strong contrast to
the colour of the insulation. The identification shall be given in letters and/or Arabic numerals. In order to avoid
confusion, unattached numerals 6 and 9 shall be underlined.

514.5.2       Protective conductor

Conductors with green-and-yellow colour identification shall not be numbered other than for the purpose of circuit
identification.

514.5.3       Alphanumeric

The preferred alphanumeric system is described in Table 51.

514.5.4       Numeric

Conductors may be identified by numbers, the number 0 being reserved for the neutral or midpoint conductor.

514.6         Omission of identification by colour or marking

514.6.1       Identification by colour or marking is not required for:
   (i) concentric conductors of cables
  (ii) metal sheath or armour of cables when used as a protective conductor
 (iii) bare conductors where permanent identification is not practicable
 (iv) extraneous-conductive-parts used as a protective conductor
  (v) exposed-conductive-parts used as a protective conductor.




                                                                                                                       133

                SELECTION AND ERECTION OF WIRING SYSTEMS
520           INTRODUCTION

520.1          Scope

This chapter deals with the selection and erection of wiring systems.
NOTE:     These regulations also apply in general to protective conductors. Chapter 54 contains further requirements for those
          conductors.

520.2           Not used

520.3           Not used

520.4          General

Consideration shall be given to the application of the fundamental principles of Chapter 13 as it applies to:
   (i) cables and conductors
  (ii) their connections, terminations and/or jointing
  (iii) their associated supports or suspensions, and
  (iv) their enclosure or methods of protection against external influences.

521           TYPES OF WIRING SYSTEM

The requirements of Regulations 521.1 to 521.201 do not apply to busbar and powertrack systems covered by
Regulation 521.4.

521 .1        The installation method of a wiring system in relation to the type of conductor or cable used shall be
in accordance with Table 4A1 of Appendix 4, provided the external influences are taken into account according to
Section 522.

521.2         The installation method of a wiring system in relation to the situation concerned shall be in accordance
with Table 4A2 of Appendix 4. Other methods of installation of cables and conductors not included in Table 4A2 are
permitted provided that they fulfil the requirements of this chapter.

521.3          Examples of wiring systems, excluding systems covered by Regulation 521.4, are shown in
Table 4A2. Table 4A2 gives examples of installation methods of cables including reference method for obtaining
current-carrying capacity where it is considered that the same current-carrying capacities can safely be used. It is
not implied that such methods must be employed or that other methods are prohibited.

521.201         Prefabricated wiring systems intended for permanent connection in fixed installations incorporating
installation couplers conforming to BS EN 61535, shall comply with BS 8488.

521.4         Busbar trunking systems and powertrack systems

A busbar trunking system shall comply with BS EN 61439-6 and a powertrack system shall comply with the
appropriate part of the BS EN 61534 series. A busbar trunking system or a powertrack system shall be installed in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, taking account of external influences. See also Appendix 8.

521.5         AC circuits: electromagnetic effects

521.5.1       Ferromagnetic enclosures: electromagnetic                 effects

The conductors of an AC circuit installed in a ferromagnetic enclosure shall be arranged so that all line conductors
and the neutral conductor, if any, and the appropriate protective conductor are contained within the same enclosure.

Where such conductors enter a ferrous enclosure, they shall be arranged such that the conductors are only collectively
surrounded by ferromagnetic material.

These requirements do not preclude the use of an additional protective conductor in parallel with the steel wire
armouring of a cable where such is required to comply with the requirements of the appropriate regulations in
Chapters 41 and 54. It is permitted for such an additional protective conductor to enter the ferrous enclosure
individually.




                                                                                                                                 139
      521.5.2          Single-core cables armoured with steel wire or steel tape shall not be used for an AC circuit.
      NOTE: The steel wire or steel tape armour of a single-core cable is regarded as a ferromagnetic enclosure. For single-core
            armoured cables, the use of aluminium armour may be considered.

      521.5.201       Electromechanical stresses

      Every conductor or cable shall have adequate strength and be so installed as to withstand the electromechanical
      forces that may be caused by any current, including fault current, it may have to carry in service.

      521.6           Conduit, ducting, trunking, tray and ladder systems
      Two or more circuits are allowed in the same conduit, ducting or trunking system provided the requirements of
      Section 528 are met.

      Cable conduits shall comply with the appropriate part of the BS EN 61386 series, cable trunking or ducting shall
      comply with the appropriate part of the BS EN 50085 series and cable tray and ladder systems shall comply with
      B S E N 61537.

      521.7           Multicore cables: two or more circuits
      Two or more circuits are allowed in the same cable provided the requirements of Section 528 are met.

      521.8           Circuit arrangements
      521.8.1        Each part of a circuit shall be arranged such that the conductors are not distributed over different
      multicore cables, conduits, ducting systems, trunking systems or tray or ladder systems.

      This requirement need not be met where a number of multicore cables, forming one circuit, are installed in parallel.
      Where multicore cables are installed in parallel each cable shall contain one conductor of each line.

      521.8.2         The line and neutral conductors of each final circuit shall be electrically separate from those of every
      other final circuit, so as to prevent the indirect energizing of a final circuit intended to be isolated.

      521.8.3     Where two or more circuits are terminated in a single junction box this shall comply with
      BS EN 60670-22.

      521.9          Use of flexible cables
      521.9.1         Aflexible cable shall be used for fixed wiring only where the relevant provisions of BS 7671 are met.
      Flexible cables used for fixed wiring shall be of the heavy duty type unless the risk of damage during installation and
      service, due to impact or other mechanical stresses, is low or has been minimized or protection against mechanical
      damage is provided.
      NOTE: Descriptions of light, ordinary and heavy duty types are given in BS EN 50565-1.

      521.9.2       Equipment that is intended to be moved in use shall be connected by flexible cables, except equipment
      supplied by contact rails.

      521.9.3        Stationary equipment which is moved temporarily for the purposes of connecting, cleaning etc.,
      e.g. cookers or flush-mounting units for installations in false floors, shall be connected with flexible cable. If the
      equipment is not subject to vibration then non-flexible cables may be used.

      521.10         Installation of cables
      521.10.1      Non-sheathed cables for fixed wiring shall be enclosed in conduit, ducting or trunking. This
      requirement does not apply to a protective conductor complying with Section 543.

      Non-sheathed cables are permitted if the cable trunking system provides at least the degree of protection IPXXD or
      IP4X, and if the cover can only be removed by means of a tool or a deliberate action.
      NOTE: For a cable trunking system to meet IP4X requirements, IP4X trunking and related system components would need to
            be installed. If a system includes site-fabricated joints the installer must confirm the completed item meets at least the
            degree of protection IPXXD.

      521.10.201 A bare live conductor shall be installed on insulators.
      521.10.202 Wiring systems shall be supported such that they will not be liable to premature collapse in the event
      of afire.
      NOTE1 : Wiring systems hanging across access or egress routes may hinder evacuation and firefighting activities.
      NOTE 2: Cables installed in or on steel cable containment systems are deemed to meet the requirements of this regulation.



140
NOTE 3: This regulation precludes, for example, the use of non-metallic cable clips or cable ties as the sole means of support
        where cables are clipped direct to exposed surfaces or suspended under cable tray, and the use of non-metallic cable
        trunking as the sole means of support of the cables therein.
NOTE 4: Suitably spaced steel or copper clips, saddles or ties are examples that will meet the requirements of this regulation.

522           SELECTION AND ERECTION OF WIRING SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO EXTERNAL
              INFLUENCES
The installation method selected shall be such that protection against the expected external influences is provided
in all appropriate parts of the wiring system. Particular care shall be taken at changes in direction and where wiring
enters into equipment.
NOTE: The external influences categorized in Appendix 5 which are of significance to wiring systems are included in this
      section.

522.1          Ambient temperature (AA)

522.1.1        A wiring system shall be selected and erected so as to be suitable for the highest and lowest local

paid to the following:
   (i) The fixing of wiring systems to the building structure
  (ii) The connections between the fixed wiring and all items of essential equipment, e.g. safety services, shall be
       selected for their flexible quality.

523           CURRENT-CARRYING CAPACITIES OF CABLES

523.1         The current, including any harmonic current, to be carried by any conductor for sustained periods
during normal operation shall be such that the appropriate temperature limit specified in Table 52.1 is not exceeded.
The value of current shall be selected in accordance with Regulation 523.2, or determined in accordance with
Regulation 523.3.

  The maximum permissible conductor temperatures given in Table 52.1 on which the tabulated current-carrying capacities
 given in Appendix 4 are based, have been taken from IEC 60502-1 and BS EN 60702-1 and are shown on these tables in
 Appendix 4.
 b
  Where a conductor operates at a temperature exceeding 70 °C it shall be ascertained that the equipment connected to the
 conductor is suitable for the resulting temperature at the connection.
 c
  For mineral insulated cables, higher operating temperatures may be permissible dependent upon the temperature rating of
 the cable, its terminations, the environmental conditions and other external influences.
 NOTE:     For temperature limits applicable to specific types of cable or insulation, refer to the cable specification or
           manufacturer.

523.2         The requirement of Regulation 523.1 is considered to be satisfied if the current for non-sheathed and
sheathed cables does not exceed the appropriate values selected from the tables of current-carrying capacity given
in Appendix 4 with reference to Table 4A2, subject to any necessary rating factors.
NOTE:     The current-carrying capacities given in the tables are provided for guidance. It is recognized that there will be some
          tolerance in the current-carrying capacities depending on the environmental conditions and the precise construction of
          the cables.

523.3           The appropriate value of current-carrying capacity may also be determined as described in BS 7769
series (some parts of the BS 7769 series are now numbered BS IEC 60287 series, eventually all parts will be
renumbered), or by test, or by calculation using a recognized method, provided that the method is stated. Where
appropriate, account shall be taken of the characteristics of the load and, for buried cables, the effective thermal
resistance of the soil.

523.4         The ambient temperature shall be considered to be the temperature of the surrounding medium when
the non-sheathed or sheathed cable(s) under consideration are not loaded.

523.5            Groups containing more than one circuit
The group rating factors, see Tables 4C1 to 4C6 of Appendix 4, are applicable to groups of non-sheathed or sheathed
cables having the same maximum operating temperature.

For groups containing non-sheathed or sheathed cables having different maximum operating temperatures, the
current-carrying capacity of all the non-sheathed or sheathed cables in the group shall be based on the lowest
maximum operating temperature of any cable in the group together with the appropriate group rating factor.

If, due to known operating conditions, a non-sheathed or sheathed cable is expected to carry a current not greater
than 30 % of its grouped current-carrying capacity, it may be ignored for the purpose of obtaining the rating factor
for the rest of the group.

523.6            Number of loaded conductors
523.6.1        The number of conductors to be considered in a circuit are those carrying load current. Where
conductors in polyphase circuits carry balanced currents, the associated neutral conductor need not be taken
into consideration. Under these conditions a four-core cable is given the same current-carrying capacity as a
three-core cable having the same conductor cross-sectional area for each line conductor. The neutral conductor shall
be considered as a loaded conductor in the case of the presence of third harmonic current or multiples of the third
harmonic presenting a total harmonic distortion greater than 15 % of the fundamental line current.

523.6.2          Where the neutral conductor in a multicore cable carries current as a result of an imbalance in the
line currents, the temperature rise due to the neutral current is offset by the reduction in the heat generated by one or
more of the line conductors. In this case the conductor size shall be chosen on the basis of the highest line current.

In all cases the neutral conductor shall have a cross-sectional area adequate to afford compliance with
Regulation 523.1.




                                                                                                                                    145
523.201       Armoured single-core cables

The metallic sheaths and/or non-magnetic armour of single-core cables in the same circuit shall normally be
bonded together at both ends of their run (solid bonding). Alternatively, the sheaths or armour of such cables having
conductors of cross-sectional area exceeding 50 mm2 and a non-conducting outer sheath may be bonded together at
one point in their run (single point bonding) with suitable insulation at the unbonded ends, in which case the length
of the cables from the bonding point shall be limited so that voltages from sheaths and/or armour to Earth:
   (i) do not cause corrosion when the cables are carrying their full load current, for example by limiting the
       voltage to 25 V, and
  (ii) do not cause danger or damage to property when the cables are carrying short-circuit current.

524           CROSS-SECTIONAL AREAS OF CONDUCTORS

524.1          The cross-sectional area of each conductor in a circuit shall be not less than the values given in
Table 52.3, except as provided for extra-low voltage lighting installations according to Regulation 715.524.201.

524.2         Neutral conductors

524.2.1        The neutral conductor, if any, shall have a cross-sectional area not less than that of the line conductor:
   (i) in single-phase, two-wire circuits, whatever the cross-sectional area
  (ii) in polyphase and single-phase three-wire circuits, where the size of the line conductors is less than or equal
       to 16 mm2 for copper, or 25 mm2 for aluminium
 (iii) in circuits where it is required according to Regulation 523.6.3.

524.2.2         If the total harmonic content due to triplen harmonics is greater than 33 % of the fundamental line
current, an increase in the cross-sectional area of the neutral conductor may be required (see Regulation 523.6.3 and
Appendix 4, section 5.5).

524.2.3         For a polyphase circuit where each line conductor has a cross-sectional area greater than 16 mm2 for
copper or 25 mm2 for aluminium, the neutral conductor is permitted to have a smaller cross-sectional area than that
of the line conductors provided that the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled:
   (i) The expected maximum current including harmonics, if any, in the neutral conductor during normal service
       is not greater than the current-carrying capacity of the reduced cross-sectional area of the neutral conductor, and
          NOTE:   The load carried by the circuit under normal service conditions should be practically equally distributed
                  between the lines.
  (ii) the neutral conductor is protected against overcurrents according to Regulation 431.2, and
 (iii) the size of the neutral conductor is at least equal to 16 mm2 for copper or 25 mm2 for aluminium, account
       being taken of Regulation 523.6.3.




                                                                                                                              147

      525              VOLTAGE DROP IN CONSUMERS’ INSTALLATIONS

      525.1           In the absence of any other consideration, under normal service conditions the voltage at the terminals
      of any fixed current-using equipment shall be greater than the lower limit corresponding to the product standard
      relevant to the equipment.

      525.201         Where fixed current-using equipment is not the subject of a product standard the voltage at the
      terminals shall be such as not to impair the safe functioning of that equipment.

      525.202         The above requirements are deemed to be satisfied if the voltage drop between the origin of the
      installation (usually the supply terminals) and a socket-outlet or the terminals of fixed current-using equipment does
      not exceed that stated in Appendix 4, section 6.4.

      525.203        A greater voltage drop than stated in Appendix 4, section 6.4 may be accepted for a motor during
      starting periods and for other equipment with high inrush currents, provided that it is verified that the voltage
      variations are within the limits specified in the relevant product standard for the equipment or, in the absence of a
      product standard, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

      526              ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

      526.1           Every connection between conductors or between a conductor and other equipment shall provide
      durable electrical continuity and adequate mechanical strength and protection.
      NOTE: See Regulation 522.8 - Other mechanical stresses.

      526.2              The selection of the means of connection shall take account of, as appropriate:
            (i) the material of the conductor and its insulation
           (ii) the number and shape of the wires forming the conductor
           (iii) the cross-sectional area of the conductor
           (iv) the number of conductors to be connected together
           (v) the temperature attained at the terminals in normal service such that the effectiveness of the insulation of the
               conductors connected to them is not impaired
           (vi) the provision of adequate locking arrangements in situations subject to vibration or thermal cycling.




148
Where the fire-segregated compartment provides a means of evacuation in an emergency then the cable shall meet
the requirements of the appropriate part of BS EN 60332-3 series.
NOTE: Cables manufactured for the above application also need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their
      reaction to fire. See Appendix 2, item 17.

527.1.4        Cables not complying with the cable requirements of Regulation 527.1.3 shall be limited to short
lengths for connection of appliances to the permanent wiring system and shall not pass from one fire-segregated
compartment to another.

527.1.5        Products having the necessary resistance to flame propagation as specified in the BS EN 61386
series, the appropriate part of BS EN 50085 series, BS EN 61439-6, BS EN 61534 series, BS EN 61537 or
BS EN 60570 may be installed without special precautions. Other products complying with standards having similar
requirements for resistance to flame propagation may be installed without special precautions.

527.1.6        Parts of wiring systems other than cables which do not comply, as a minimum, with the flame
propagation requirements as specified in the BS EN 61386 series, the appropriate part of BS EN 50085 series,
BS EN 61439-6, BS EN 61534 series or BS EN 61537 but which comply in all other respects with the requirements
of their respective product standard shall, if used, be completely enclosed in suitable non-combustible building
materials.

527.2          Sealing of wiring system penetrations

527.2.1          Where a wiring system passes through elements of building construction such as floors, walls, roofs,
ceilings, partitions or cavity barriers, the openings remaining after passage of the wiring system shall be sealed
according to the degree of fire-resistance (if any) prescribed for the respective element of building construction
before penetration.

This requirement is satisfied if the sealing of the wiring system concerned has passed a relevant type test meeting
the requirements of Regulation 527.2.3.

527.2.1.1       During the erection of a wiring system temporary sealing arrangements shall be provided as
appropriate.

527.2.1.2      During alteration work, sealing which has been disturbed shall be reinstated as soon as practicable.

527.2.2        A wiring system such as a conduit system, cable ducting system, cable trunking system, busbar or
busbar trunking system which penetrates elements of building construction having specified fire-resistance shall
be internally sealed to the degree of fire-resistance of the respective element before penetration as well as being
externally sealed as required by Regulation 527.2.1.

This requirement is satisfied if the sealing of the wiring system concerned has passed a relevant type test meeting
the requirements of Regulation 527.2.3.
NOTE: Reference should be made to the intended manufacturers’ guidance on the specific fire sealing product to be used with
      regard to the size and arrangement of trunking or containment.

527.2.3         A conduit system, cable trunking system or cable ducting system classified as non-flame propagating
according to the relevant product standard and having a maximum internal cross-sectional area of 710 mm2 need not
be internally sealed provided that:
   (i) the system satisfies the test of BS EN 60529 for IP33, and
  (ii) any termination of the system in one of the compartments, separated by the building construction being
       penetrated, satisfies the test of BS EN 60529 for IP33.

527.2.4         Any sealing arrangement intended to satisfy Regulation 527.2.1 or 527.2.1.1 shall resist external
influences to the same degree as the wiring system with which it is used and, in addition, it shall meet all of the
following requirements:
   (i) It shall be resistant to the products of combustion to the same extent as the elements of building construction
       which have been penetrated
  (ii) It shall provide the same degree of protection from water penetration as that required for the building
       construction element in which it has been installed
 (iii) It shall be compatible with the material of the wiring system with which it is in contact
  (iv) It shall permit thermal movement of the wiring system without reduction of the sealing quality
  (v) It shall be of adequate mechanical stability to withstand the stresses which may arise through damage to the
      support of the wiring system due to fire.
The seal and the wiring system shall be protected from dripping water which may travel along the wiring system or
which may otherwise collect around the seal unless the materials used in the seal are all resistant to moisture when
finally assembled for use.
NOTE:     This regulation may be satisfied if:
             - either cable cleats, cable ties or cable supports are installed within 750 mm of the seal, and are able to withstand
                the mechanical loads expected following the collapse of the supports on the fire side of the seal to the extent that
                no strain is transferred to the seal, or
             - the design of the sealing system itself provides adequate support.

528            PROXIMITY OF WIRING SYSTEMS TO OTHER SERVICES

528.1           Proximity to electrical services
Except where one of the following methods is adopted, neither a voltage Band I nor a voltage Band II circuit shall
be contained in the same wiring system as a circuit of nominal voltage exceeding that of low voltage, and a Band I
circuit shall not be contained in the same wiring system as a Band II circuit:
   (i) Every cable or conductor is insulated for the highest voltage present
  (ii) Each conductor of a multicore cable is insulated for the highest voltage present in the cable
  (iii) The cables are insulated for their system voltage and installed in a separate compartment of a cable ducting
        or cable trunking system

NOTE 2: Segregation requirements for communications services are given in BS 6701 and BS EN 50174 series.

528.3          Proximity to non-electrical services
528.3.1         A wiring system shall not be installed in the vicinity of services which produce heat, smoke or fumes
likely to be detrimental to the wiring, unless it is protected from harmful effects by shielding arranged so as not to
affect the dissipation of heat from the wiring.

In areas not specifically designed for the installation of cables, e.g. service shafts and cavities, the cables shall be
laid so that they are not exposed to any harmful influence by the normal operation of adjacent installations (e.g. gas,
water or steam lines).

528.3.2        Where a wiring system is routed below services liable to cause condensation (such as water, steam
or gas services), precautions shall be taken to protect the wiring system from deleterious effects.

528.3.3         Where an electrical service is to be installed in proximity to one or more non-electrical services it
shall be so arranged that any foreseeable operation carried out on the other services will not cause damage to the
electrical service or the converse.
NOTE:     This may be achieved by:
            (i) suitable spacing between the services, or
           (ii) the use of mechanical or thermal shielding.




                                                                                                                                       151
      528.3.4        Where an electrical service is located in close proximity to one or more non-electrical services, both
      the following conditions shall be met:

             other services in normal use
        (ii) Fault protection shall be afforded in accordance with the requirements of Section 411.
      NOTE: The requirements for segregation between low pressure gas systems and electrical equipment are given in BS 6891.

      528.3.5       No cable shall be run in a lift or hoist well unless it forms part of the lift installation as defined in
      BS EN 81 series.

      529          SELECTION AND ERECTION OF WIRING SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO
                   MAINTAINABILITY,INCLUDING CLEANING

      529.1          With regard to maintainability, reference shall be made to Regulation 132.12.

      529.2          Where it is necessary to remove any protective measure in order to carry out maintenance, provision
      shall be made so that the protective measure can be reinstated without reduction of the degree of protection originally
      intended.

      529.3         Provision shall be made for safe and adequate access to all parts of a wiring system which may
      require maintenance.

      530           INTRODUCTION

      530.1          Scope

      This chapter deals with general requirements for protection, isolation, switching, control and monitoring and with
      the requirements for selection and erection of the devices provided to fulfil such functions.
      NOTE: In Chapter 53, reference to short-circuit, where relevant, includes earth fault. Short-circuit Protective Device (SCPD),
            where relevant, also means earth fault current protective device.

      530.2          Not used

      530.3          General and common requirements

      530.3.1         Every item of equipment shall be selected and erected so as to allow compliance with the requirements
      stated in the following regulations.

      530.3.2      The moving contacts of multipole switching devices marked for the connection of the neutral or
      midpoint may close before and open after the other contacts.

      530.3.3         A switching device shall not be inserted in the neutral conductor alone.

      530.3.4        Devices embodying more than one function, as defined in the following regulations, shall comply
      with the relevant requirements of this chapter appropriate to each separate function.

      530.3.5         Equipment intended for protection only shall not be provided for functional switching of circuits.
      NOTE: See Table 537.4 - Guidance on the selection of protective, isolation and switching devices.

      530.4          Fixing of equipment

      530.4.1        Taking into account the manufacturer’s instructions, if any, equipment shall be erected in such a
      way that connections between wiring and equipment shall not be subject to undue stress or strain resulting from the
      normal use of the equipment.

      530.4.2        Unenclosed equipment shall be mounted in a suitable mounting box or enclosure in compliance
      with the relevant part of BS EN 60670, BS EN 62208 or other relevant standards such as BS EN 61439 series.
      Socket-outlets, connection units, plate switches and similar accessories shall be fitted to a mounting box complying
      with BS 4662 or BS 5733 and with the relevant part of BS EN 60670.

      530.4.3         Equipment such as circuit-breakers, switches, socket-outlets, control equipment, etc. may be installed
      on or in a cable trunking system complying with BS EN 50085 series. Wherever equipment is fixed on or in cable
      trunking, skirting trunking or in mouldings it shall not be fixed on covers which can be removed inadvertently.

      531           DEVICES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTRIC SHOCK BY AUTOMATIC
                    DISCONNECTION OF SUPPLY

      531.1          General

      531.1.1         Devices for protection against electric shock by automatic disconnection of supply shall be suitable
      for isolation in accordance with Chapter 46 and Section 537.

      Automatic reclosing of devices for protection against electric shock by automatic disconnection of supply shall
      only be installed in the associated part of the installation where access is restricted to instructed persons or skilled
      persons only.

      A warning notice shall be clearly displayed near the point of access to the associated part of the installation controlled
      by the auto-reclosing device, indicating its automatic reclose function must be disengaged prior to entry.
      NOTE: Automatic Reclosing Devices are intended to reclose circuit-breakers, RCBOs and RCCBs after tripping, in order to
            re-establish continuity of service.




154
      In IT systems, in the event of a second fault, the operation of the overcurrent protective device shall result in
      the disconnection of all corresponding live conductors, including the neutral conductor, if any (see also
      Regulation 431.2.2).

      531.3           Residua! current devices (RCDs)

      531.3.1         General

      Except where Regulation 531.3.1.201 applies, an RCD shall disconnect all live conductors of the circuit protected.

      The protective conductor shall not pass through the sensor of the RCD except where this is unavoidable, e.g. in the
      case of armoured cables. In such exceptional cases, the protective conductor alone has to be passed again through
      the sensor but in the reverse direction. The protective conductor shall be insulated and shall not be earthed either at
      the first or at the second passing through the sensor.

      A protective conductor current shall not contribute to the measurement of the residual current.

      531.3.1.201 For protection against electric shock, there is no requirement to disconnect/switch the neutral in
      TT or TN systems.

      531.3.1.202 It is not permissible to introduce an external connection for the purpose of intentionally creating a
      residual current to trip an RCD.
      NOTE 1 : This does not preclude the use of an RCD with a functional earth connection.
      NO T E 2: This does not preclude the use of a test instrument in accordance with Part 6.

      531.3.2         Unwanted tripping

      Residual current protective devices shall be selected and erected such as to limit the risk of unwanted tripping. The
      following shall be considered:
         (i) subdivision of circuits with individual associated RCDs. RCDs shall be selected and the circuits subdivided
             in such a way that any earth leakage current likely to occur during normal operation of the connected load
             will not cause unwanted tripping of the device. See also Section 314
        (ii) the use of RCBOs for individual final circuits in residential premises. See also Section 314
        (iii) in order to avoid unwanted tripping by protective conductor currents and/or earth leakage currents, the
              accumulation of such currents downstream of the RCD shall be not more than 30 % of the rated residual
              operating current
                NO T E 1 : This will also allow a better selection of the type of RCDs according to the nature of the circuit or the load.
                NOTE 2: RCDs may operate at any value of residual current in excess of 50 % of the rated residual current.
        (iv) use of short time-delayed RCDs, provided the applicable requirements of Chapter 41 are met
                NO T E 3:   In the case of transient effects, tripping of the RCD may occur by charging of bypass capacitors or by other
                            electromagnetic disturbances.
        (v) coordination of general type RCDs, selective type RCDs and time-delayed RCDs (CBRs according to
            BS EN 60947-2) as covered in Section 536
                NO T E 4:   CBR is a circuit-breaker incoiporating residual current protection.
        (vi) coordination of RCDs with surge protective devices (SPD) according to Regulation 534.4.7.

      531.3.3        Types of RCD

      Different types of RCD exist, depending on their behaviour in the presence of DC components and frequencies. The
      appropriate RCD shall be selected from the following:
         (i) RCD Type AC: RCD tripping on alternating sinusoidal residual current, suddenly applied or smoothly
             increasing
        (ii) RCD Type A: RCD tripping on alternating sinusoidal residual current and on residual pulsating direct
             current, suddenly applied or smoothly increasing
                NO T E 1:   For RCD Type A, tripping is achieved for residual pulsating direct currents superimposed on a smooth
                            direct current up to 6 mA.
       (iii) RCD Type F: RCD for which tripping is achieved as for Type A and in addition:
              (a) for composite residual currents, whether suddenly applied or slowly rising, intended for circuit supplied
                  between line and neutral or line and earthed middle conductor
              (b) for residual pulsating direct currents superimposed on smooth direct current.


156
531 .3.5.4.2       Case of second fault on another live conductor when exposed-conductive-parts
                   are interconnected

Where RCDs are used according to Regulation 411.6.3(v), one RCD per circuit shall be used.

The operating characteristics of this RCD shall be selected according to Table 41.1 of Chapter 41.

531.3.5.4.3        Case of second fault on another live conductor when exposed-conductive-parts
                   are not interconnected

Where, in an installation, all exposed-conductive-parts are not interconnected, one RCD shall protect each group of
interconnected exposed-conductive-parts.

The conditions for determining the characteristics of the RCD shall be those for TT systems defined in
Regulation 411.5:
      - The rated residual operating current IAn has to be selected according to Table 53.1.
      - The disconnection time has to comply with the values given in Regulation 411.3.

In addition, fault protection for every circuit located downstream of this RCD shall be provided in accordance with
the requirements of Regulation 411,6.3(v). In this case every final circuit shall be individually protected by an RCD.

531.3.6        RCDs for additional protection

The use of RCDs with a rated residual operating current not exceeding 30 mA is recognized as additional
protection in compliance with Regulation 415.1. These RCDs shall be provided to comply with the requirements of
Regulation 411.3.3.

RCDs for additional protection in AC installations shall comply with:
      - BS EN 61008 series, or
      - BS EN 61009 series, or
      - B S E N 62423, or
      - BS 7288.

Where installed at the origin of a final circuit or a group of final circuits, an RCD with a rated residual operating
current not exceeding 30 mA may provide fault protection and additional protection simultaneously.
NOTE: Consideration shall be given to the division of the installation (see Regulations 531.3.2 and 314.2).

532            DEVICES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THE RISK OF FIRE

532.1          General

In locations where, in accordance with Chapter 42, a particular risk of fire exists, preventive protection measures
against the risk of fire are required. This may also apply to other locations of the electrical installation, depending
on a risk analysis.
NOTE: A suitable evaluation of the risk should be carried out by one or more persons competent in fire risk assessments.

The selection of protective and monitoring devices shall take into account the nature of the load and the likelihood
of the device to operate, e.g. fault currents of higher frequencies, DC fault currents or increased leakage currents.
(See also Regulation 331.1.)

532.2          Residual current devices (RCDs) for protection against the risk of fire

RCDs shall comply with Regulations 531.3.1 to 531.3.4 and with the applicable requirements of Regulation 531.3.5.

RCDs with a rated residual operating current not exceeding 300 mA shall be used. RCDs shall be installed at the
origin of the circuit to be protected.

532.3          Residual current monitoring devices (RCMs) for protection against the risk of fire in
               IT systems

In IT systems, RCMs may be used as an alternative to RCDs in accordance with Regulation 532.2, provided that the
location is supervised by one or more skilled or instructed person(s).

RCMs shall be in accordance with BS EN 62020 and operate in conjunction with switchgear suitable for isolation.

RCMs shall be installed at the origin of final circuits. The rated residual operating current shall not exceed 300 mA.
Audible and visual signals shall be provided by the RCMs.

                                                                                                                           15 9
      532.4          Insulation monitoring devices (IMDs) for protection against the risk of fire in IT
                     systems
      Insulation monitoring devices applied in IT systems for protection against the risk of fire shall comply with the
      requirements of Section 538.

      A fault location system in accordance with the requirement of Regulation 538.2 able to locate the faulty circuit, may
      also be used.

      532.5          Internal arc fault protection in a switchgear and controlgear assembly
      Where required for special applications, internal arc fault protection (e.g. optical detection system) detecting a fault
      arc together with a protection system can be selected in order to extinguish the arc.

      Alternatively, an assembly with arc ignition protected zone(s) can be selected to minimise the risk of an arcing fault.
      (Arcing class 1 in accordance with PD IEC/TR 61641.)
      NOTE:     Internal arc fault protection is typically associated with a switchboard used in special applications. An assembly that
                has been subject to an internal arcing fault can require maintenance or replacement.

      532.6          Arc fault detection devices (AFDDs)
      Where specified, arc fault detection devices shall be installed:
         (i) at the origin of the final circuits to be protected, and
        (ii) in AC single-phase circuits not exceeding 230 V.

      AFDDs shall comply with BS EN 62606. Coordination of AFDDs with overcurrent protective devices, if necessary,
      shall take account of the manufacturer's instructions.

      533           DEVICES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST OVERCURRENT

      533.1          General requirements

      533.1.1        Compliance with standards

      A device for protection against overcurrent shall comply with one or more of the following:
            - BS 88 series
            - BS 64 6
            - BS 1362
            - BS 3036
            - BS EN 60898 series
            - BS EN 60947 series
            - BS EN 61009 series
            - B S E N 62423.

      The use of another device is not precluded provided that its time/current characteristics provide a level of protection
      not less than that given by the devices listed above.

      The following protective devices shall be used only for protection against short-circuit current:
            - instantaneous trip circuit-breakers (ICB) in accordance with Annex O of BS EN 60947-2
            - aM and aR type fuses in accordance with BS HD 60269-2 or BS HD 60269-3.

      For every fuse and circuit-breaker there shall be provided on or adjacent to it an indication of its intended rated
      current as appropriate to the circuit it protects. For a semi-enclosed fuse, the intended rated current to be indicated
      is the value to be selected in accordance with Regulation 533.1.2.3.

      533.1.2       Fuses

      533.1.2.1    A fuse base shall be arranged so as to exclude the possibility of the fuse carrier making contact
      between conductive parts belonging to two adjacent fuse bases.

      A fuse base using screw-in fuses shall be connected so that the centre contact is connected to the conductor from the
      supply and the shell contact is connected to the conductor to the load.




160
      533.2.2        Additional requirements for protection against overload when harmonic currents are
                     present

      When selecting an overload protective device to comply with Regulation 433.1, account shall be taken of harmonic
      currents in accordance with Regulation 431.2.3.
      NOTE: See also Appendix 4 for further details on harmonics.

      533.3         Selection of devices for protection of wiring systems against fault current

      The application of the regulations of Chapter 43 shall take into account both the minimum and maximum fault
      current conditions, so that the highest energy let-through is taken into account.
      Where the standard covering a protective device specifies both a rated service short-circuit breaking capacity and
      a rated ultimate short-circuit breaking capacity, it is acceptable to select the protective device on the basis of the
      ultimate short-circuit breaking capacity for the maximum fault current conditions. Operational circumstances may,
      however, make it desirable to select the protective device on the service short-circuit breaking capacity, e.g. where
      a protective device is placed at the origin of the installation.
      Where the short-circuit breaking capacity of the protective device is lower than the maximum prospective
      short-circuit or earth fault current that is expected at its point of installation, it is necessary to comply with the
      requirements of the last paragraph of Regulation 536.1 and Regulation 536.5.
      NOTE: To calculate the maximum and minimum fault currents, see Technical Report PD CLC/TR 50480 'Determination of
            cross-sectional area of conductors and selection of protective devices'. See also Appendix 4, paragraph 2.5.

      534          DEVICES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST OVERVOLTAGE

      For further information see Appendix 16.

      534.1         General

      This section contains provisions for the application of voltage limitation in order to obtain insulation coordination
      in the cases described in Section 443, BS EN IEC 60664-1, BS EN 62305 series and BS EN 61643 series. This                |
      section focuses mainly on the requirements for the selection and erection of SPDs for protection against transient
      overvoltages where required by Section 443, the BS EN 62305 series, or as otherwise stated.
      BS EN 62305-4 and DD/CLC/TS 61643-12 series deal with the protection against the effects of direct lightning             |
      strokes or strokes near to the supply system. Both documents describe the selection and the application of surge
      protective devices (SPDs) according to the Lightning Protection Zones (LPZ) concept. The LPZ concept describes
      the installation of Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 SPDs. See Figure 534.1.




162
534.4.4        Selection of SPDs

534.4.4.1      General
The following parameters shall be considered for SPD protection:
     - voltage protection level (U p) of the SPD and rated impulse withstand voltage (Uw ) of the equipment to be
       protected (see Regulation 534.4.4.2)
     - continuous operating voltage (Uc) of the SPD, i.e. supply system (TT, TN, IT) (see Regulation 534.4.4.3)
     -   nominal discharge current (I nspd) and/or impulse discharge current (I imp) of the SPD (see Regulation 534.4.4.4)
     - SPD coordination (see Regulation 534.4.4.5)
     - expected short-circuit current (Isccr) (see Regulation 534.4.4.6)
     - follow current interrupt rating (I fi) (SPDs shall comply with the requirements of BS EN 61643-11).
NOTE:     Additional information regarding selection and application is given in DD CLC/TS 61643-12. Annex D of DD
          CLC/TS 61643-12 provides application examples of selecting SPDs.

534.4.4.2      Selection with regard to voltage protection level (Up)

The voltage protection level (Up) of SPDs shall be selected in accordance with impulse withstand voltage
Category II of Table 443.2 and in no case exceed the required rated impulse voltage of the equipment.
NOTE 1 : In some cases, for example where the continuous operation of the equipment is critical, the voltage protection level
         (Up) of SPDs can be selected to be lower than the impulse immunity of equipment. The impulse immunity voltage
         of equipment is lower than the impulse withstand of equipment and requires SPDs with lower voltage protection
         level U p between live conductors (e.g. line to neutral) to avoid equipment malfunction, particularly against switching
         transients. For further information see DD CLC/TS 61643-12.

In installations operating at 230/400 V, the voltage protection level of the installed SPD assembly shall not exceed
2.5 kV, as the SPD's connecting leads have additional inductive voltage drop across them (see Regulation 534.4.8).
It may, therefore, be necessary to select an SPD with a lower voltage protection level.

If the distance between the SPD and equipment to be protected (protective distance) is greater than 10 m, oscillations
could lead to a voltage at the equipment terminals of up to twice the SPD’s voltage protection level. Consideration
shall be given to the provision of additional coordinated SPDs, closer to the equipment, or the selection of SPDs
with a lower voltage protection level.
NOTE 2: It is recommended that the voltage protection level provided by SPDs does not exceed a safety margin of 80 % of the
        required rated impulse voltage for equipment according to Table 443.2 and corresponding to overvoltage category II.

This safety margin is not necessary where one of the following cases applies:
              - where the equipment is connected directly to the SPD terminals
              - where a protection scheme according to Figure 534.9 is already applied
              - where the voltage drop across the overcurrent protection in the SPD branch circuit is already taken into account
                for the voltage protection level U p
              - where protection according to overvoltage category II is provided but only overvoltage category III or IV
                equipment is installed at this location.
NOTE 3: DD CLC/TS 61643-12 gives additional information about the rated impulse voltage of equipment and the given U p for
        the SPD.

Table 534.1       Not used

534.4.4.3      Selection of SPDs with regard to continuous operating voltage (Uc)
In AC installations, the maximum continuous operating voltage U c of SPDs shall be equal to or higher than required
by Table 534.2.

534.4.5       Protection of the SPD against overcurrent

534.4.5.1     General
SPD installations shall be protected against overcurrent with respect to short-circuit currents.

This protection may be internal and/or external to the SPD according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The ratings and characteristics of external OCPDs for protecting the SPD assembly shall be selected in accordance
with Section 434 and be the highest permissible rating to provide a high surge current capability for the complete
assembly whilst not exceeding the ratings and characteristics as required in the SPD manufacturer's installation
instructions for the maximum overcurrent protection.

534.4.5.2     Arrangement of SPDs with relation to overcurrent protection
In case of OCPD operation arising from SPD failure, the continuity of the supply to the equipment is unaffected.
However, neither the installation nor the equipment is protected against possible further overvoltages
(see Figure 534.6). In such an arrangement, the effective voltage protection level within the installation is increased
due to the additional voltage drop at the external OCPD connected in series with the SPD.




                                                                                                                          169

      534.4.5.3        Selectivity between OCPDs

      Where selectivity between OCPDs is necessary to prevent danger and where required for proper functioning of the
      installation, the manufacturer's instructions shall be taken into account; see Regulation 536.4.

      534.4.6          Fault protection

      Fault protection, as defined in Chapter 41, shall remain effective in the protected installation even in the event of
      SPD failure.

      In the case of automatic disconnection of supply:
             -   in TN systems, this may generally be fulfilled by the OCPD on the supply side of the SPD (See Figure 16A1
                 of Appendix 16);
             -   in TT systems, this may be fulfilled by:
                 (a) the installation of SPDs downstream (load side) of an RCD (See Figure 16A2 of Appendix 16), or
                 (b) the installation of SPDs upstream (supply side) of the main RCD. Owing to the possibility of a failure of
                     an SPD connected between neutral conductor and PE, the conditions of Regulation 411.4.1 shall be met
                     and the SPDs shall be installed in accordance with connection Type CT2 (See Figure 16A3 of Appendix 16).
             -   in IT systems, no additional measure is needed (See Figure 16A4 of Appendix 16).

534.4.7         SPD installation in conjunction with RCDs

Where SPDs are installed in accordance with Regulation 534.4.1 and are on the load side of an RCD, an RCD
having an immunity to surge currents of at least 3 kA 8/20 shall be used.
NOTE 1 : Type S RCDs in accordance with BS EN 61008-1 and BS EN 61009-1 satisfy this requirement.

Installation of Type 1 SPDs downstream of an RCD is not recommended.
NOTE 2: In the case of a surge current higher than 3 kA 8/20, the RCD may trip causing interruption of the supply.

534.4.8         Connection of SPDs

All conductors and interconnections to the relevant line to be protected, together with the connections between the
SPD and any external OCPD, shall be kept as short and as straight as possible and any unnecessary cable loops shall
be avoided.

The length of the connecting conductors is defined as the sum of the path length of conductors used from the line
conductor to the PE in between connection points A and B as shown in Figure 534.8 (for example, a + b + c).

 NOTE: When the OCPD is not present, length b is equal to 0.



Consideration shall be given to limit the total wiring length of conductors between connection points of the SPD
assembly, which should preferably not exceed 0.5 m and in no case exceed 1.0 m.

To meet these requirements, the main protective conductor shall be connected to the earthing terminal located as
near as possible to the SPD by adding, if necessary, an intermediate earthing terminal (see Figure 534.9).

To determine the total length of the connecting conductors according to Figure 534.9, the following conductor
lengths shall not be taken into account:




                                                                                                                      171
             - between the main earthing terminal and the intermediate earthing terminal
             -   between the intermediate earthing terminal and the PE conductor.

      The length (and therefore inductance) of the conductors between the SPDs and the main earthing terminal shall be
      kept to a minimum. SPDs may be connected to the main earthing terminal or to the protective conductor via metallic
      parts, e.g. the metallic enclosures of the assembly (see Regulation 534.4.2), provided it is connected to PE and meets
      the requirements for a protective conductor in accordance with Chapter 54. Connection of the relevant SPD(s) to the
      main earthing terminal, and in addition to the main protective conductor, may improve the voltage protection level.

      If the total wiring length (a+b+c) as defined in Figure 534.8 exceeds 0.5 m, at least one of the following options
      shall be chosen:
             - select an SPD with a lower voltage protection level U p (a 1 m length of rectilinear conductor carrying a
               discharge current of 10 kA (8/20) adds a voltage drop of about 1 000 V)
             - install a second coordinated SPD close to the equipment to be protected so as to adapt the voltage protection
               level Up to the rated impulse voltage of the equipment to be protected
             - use the installation method as shown in Figure 534.9.

      - 16 mm2 copper or equivalent for Type 1 SPDs installed at or near the origin of the installation.

Referring to Regulation 433.3. l(ii), conductors connecting SPDs and the OCPDs to live conductors shall be rated
to withstand the prospective short-circuit current to be expected and shall have a cross-sectional area not less than:
     - 2.5 mm2 copper or equivalent for Type 2 SPDs installed at or near the origin of the installation
      - 6 mm2 copper or equivalent for Type 1 SPDs installed at or near the origin of the installation.

535           DEVICES FOR PROTECTION AGAINST UNDERVOLTAGE

Devices for protection against undervoltage shall comply with the relevant requirements of Section 445.

For protection of persons and property, devices for protection against undervoltage may be required.

Protective devices against undervoltage are selected as follows:
   (i) direct operating undervoltage release:
            lower value of the relay operating voltage
             higher value of the relay operating voltage
            time delay (if required)
  (ii) indirect operating undervoltage release:
            lower value of the operating voltage
             higher value of the operating voltage
            time delay (if required)
 (iii) automatic reclosing when the voltage is restored:
             with reclosing prevention
            without reclosing prevention.

The characteristics of the protective devices against undervoltage shall be coordinated with the requirements in the
relevant standards for switching on (inrush current) operation and switching off of the electrical equipment.

536           COORDINATION OF ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT FOR PROTECTION, ISOLATION,
              SWITCHING AND CONTROL

536.1          General

This section covers coordination in the case of a fault and overload conditions and also takes into consideration
aspects in Section 133 relevant to the coordination of electrical devices as follows:
      - overcurrent protective device (OCPD)
      - control and protective switching device (CPS)
      - residual current device (RCD)
      - contactor and starter
      - switch and disconnector.
NOTE 1 : Coordination of monitoring devices is under consideration.
NOTE 2: Reference to the meaning of some of the abbreviations used in this section may be found in Table A53.1 in Annex A53
         located at the end of this chapter.

Section 536 does not provide requirements for the selection of an electrical device alone, but provides requirements
for the selection of electrical devices to achieve electrical coordination between them.

The requirements also cover aspects of continuity of supply of the installation.

536.2          Electrical devices considered and function provided
NOTE: Table A53.1 in Annex A53 shows the functions provided by different electrical devices.




                                                                                                                              173
      536.3          Coordination requirements
      For selecting electrical devices as covered by the following regulations, the mutual interaction between those
      devices shall be considered so that they do not adversely affect the safety of the installation.

      The coordination of electrical devices considers requirements in case of:
           - short-circuit
           - overload
           -   residual currents.

      Aspects for coordination of electrical devices are:
           - selectivity
           - short-circuit protection
          -    overload protection.

      Electrical devices shall be selected taking into account the coordination characteristics as given by the manufacturers.

      536.4          Requirements for selectivity

      536.4.1        General

      Selectivity between OCPDs is defined in Regulation 536.4.1.2 for overload conditions and in Regulation 536.4.1.3
      for short-circuit conditions. Selectivity between RCDs is defined in Regulation 536.4.1.4 and selectivity between
      OCPD and RCD is defined in Regulation 536.4.1.5.

      In this regulation, the OCPD could be replaced by an SCPD.

      536.4.1.2      Selectivity under overload conditions between OCPDs

      536.4.1.2.1 General requirements
      Where selectivity is required, as shown in Figure 536.1, the design shall be verified either by:
          - desk study, taking into account the relevant product standards and the manufacturer's literature, or
          - appropriate software tools where information is provided by the manufacturer for this specific use, or
          - tests in accordance with the applicable product standard (in order to achieve the correct test performances
            and reproducibility), or
          -    manufacturer’s declaration.

      In the case of a desk study, when time/current characteristics are used to verify selectivity, account shall be taken
      of the reference ambient temperature for which the tripping curves are given and to load conditions before the
      overcurrent.

174
536.4.1.3      Selectivity under short-circuit conditions between OCPDs

536.4.1.3.1 General requirements
Where selectivity is required (see Figure 536.1), verification shall be made either by:
     - desk study, taking into account the relevant product standard and the manufacturer’s literature, or
     - appropriate software tools where information is provided by the manufacturer for this specific use, or
     - tests in accordance with the applicable product standard (in order to achieve the correct test performances
       and reproducibility), or
     - manufacturer’s declaration.

In the case of a desk study, when energy limitation curves are used to verify selectivity, account shall be taken of the
voltage for which the curves are given.

In cases given in A53.7 and A53.10 in Annex A53, selectivity will be obtained for short-circuit currents up to a
specific value, the selectivity limit current. The value of this limit will be given by the manufacturer. In a particular
installation selectivity may be total or partial.
NOTE:     Generally, manufacturers provide tables giving information on selectivity in case of short-circuit.

536.4.1.4      Selectivity between RCDs
(i) General requirements
Where selectivity is required (see Figure 536.2), verification shall be made either by:
     - desk study, taking into account the relevant product standard and the manufacturer’s literature, or
     - appropriate software tools where information is provided by the manufacturer for this specific use, or
     - tests in accordance with the applicable product standard (in order to achieve the correct test performances
       and reproducibility), or
     - manufacturer’s declaration.
NOTE 1 : Generally, manufacturers provide information specifying selectivity between RCDs.

(ii) Selectivity in case of residual currents
Selectivity in case of residual currents, as shown in Figure 536.2, is given under the following conditions:
     - the upstream RCD is of selective type (type S or time-delayed type with appropriate time delay setting), and
     - the ratio of the rated residual operating current of the upstream RCD to that of the downstream RCD is at
       least 3:1.

In the case of RCDs with adjustable rated residual operating current and time delay, reference shall be made to
manufacturer’s instructions for selectivity.
NOTE 2: RCD type S is in accordance with BS EN 61008 series or BS EN 61009 series.
NOTE 3: A time-delay type RCD in accordance with BS EN 60947-2, Annex B or Annex M will be marked with the symbol At
         followed by the limiting non-actuating time in ms or marked with an [S].




                                                                                                                            175

NOTE 4: RCD1 is type S or time-delayed type.

536.4.1.5     Selectivity between OCPDs and RCDs

536.4.1.5.1 Selectivity between RCD(s) and upstream OCPD
In the event of an earth fault, current may reach a high value that could exceed the instantaneous tripping current
of the upstream OCPD. Therefore, when selectivity between RCD(s) and upstream OCPD is required, an RCBO or
CBR shall be used and the requirements of selectivity according to Regulation 536.4.1.2 shall be applied.

                     Fig 536.3 - Selectivity between OCPD and RCD using RCBOs




In Figure 536.3, if RCCBs are used instead of RCBOs, selectivity cannot be guaranteed. In this case, if there
are OCPDs downstream of the RCCB, as shown in Figure 536.4, selectivity may be achieved provided that the
requirements of Regulation 536.4.1.2 and Regulation 536.4.1.3 are fulfilled. In addition, the connection between the
RCCB and the downstream OCPD shall be selected and erected so as to minimize the risk of earth faults.
NOTE: In order to minimize the risk of faults between RCCB and downstream OCPD, specific wiring accessories may be used
      (e.g. specific busbars).
                     Fig 536.4 - Selectivity between OCPD and RCD using RCCBs




536.4.1.6     Selectivity between RCDs and downstream OCPDs
In the event of an earth fault, the earth fault current may be lower than the instantaneous tripping current of the
downstream OCPD. In this case, the upstream RCD will trip and selectivity may not be achieved. Therefore, when
selectivity between RCDs and downstream OCPD is required, RCBOs shall be used and selectivity requirements
according to Regulation 536.4.1.4 shall be applied.

      536.4.2         Requirements for protection in case of short-circuit

      536.4.2.1       Combined short-circuit protection of OCPDs
      In this regulation, the OCPD could be replaced by an SCPD.

      This breaking technique allows the use of short-circuit protective devices with a lower breaking capacity than
      required in Chapter 43. It is only applicable to short-circuit protective devices.

                Fig 536.6 - Typical configuration for combined short-circuit protection of OCPDs




      Regulation 434.5.1 permits a device with a lower rated breaking capacity than the prospective short-circuit current
      at its point of installation to be used in specific conditions.

      When selecting two OCPDs for combined short-circuit protection, reference shall be made to the instructions of the
      manufacturer of the downstream OCPD. These instructions are derived from tests performed according to relevant
      product standards, as applicable (e.g. BS EN 60947-2 and BS EN 60898-1). Where no information is available from
      the manufacturer, combined short-circuit protection of OCPDs shall not be used, and each OCPD shall have the
      required short-circuit capability at the point of installation.

      If declared by the manufacturer of both devices, the combined short-circuit capability of OCPD1 and OCPD2 may
      be higher than the breaking capacity of either OCPD. In this case, the connection between the two devices has to
      minimize the risk of short-circuits and there shall not be any short-circuit contributions by other active equipment
      in parallel to OCPD1.
      NOTE 1 : Coordination of an OCPD with a separate current limiter to increase the short-circuit breaking capacity of an OCPD
               may be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
      NOTE 2: Combined short-circuit protection may be used for manual motor starter having a short-circuit capability in combination
               with OCPD, when declared in the manufacturer documentation.

      536.4.2.2      Back-up protection of contactors or overload relays
      In this regulation, the OCPD could be replaced by an SCPD.

      Contactors complying with BS EN 60947-4-1 or BS EN 61095 do not provide protection against short-circuit, thus
      they shall be protected by an upstream overcurrent protective device (OCPD).
      NOTE 1 : Control and Protective Switching Devices (CPS) provide protection against short-circuit, and therefore provide
               intrinsic coordination.

Regulation 512.1.2 requires equipment to be selected for the design current which it has to carry in normal service
and the current likely to flow in abnormal conditions. In the event of short-circuit, the let-through energy and the
peak current may cause the contactor to open its contacts at a level of current beyond its making and breaking
capacity. Coordination of the contactor and the OCPD is needed to achieve safe operation in case of short-circuit.

Coordination between a contactor and an OCPD is verified by mandatory short-circuit tests according to
BS EN 60947-4-1 or to BS EN 61095, as applicable.

Contactors shall be selected and erected in conjunction with the short-circuit protective device declared by the
manufacturer, such that the rated conditional short-circuit current is higher than the prospective short-circuit current
at the point of installation.

The rated conditional short-circuit current can only be obtained by type-testing and thus the data for the selection
of the OCPD shall be obtained from the manufacturer of the contactor, taking into account the rated operational
current, rated operational voltage and the corresponding utilization category.
NOTE 2: This information is generally provided in coordination tables which summarize the combination of devices (OCPD,
        contactor or motor starter) able to maintain a safe behaviour for a given rated conditional short-circuit.

In a motor circuit the overload current protection may be provided by separate overload relay electrically connected
with the contactor. In such a case protection of the overload relay shall also be achieved, since the overload relay
may be damaged by the let-through energy (I2t) of the OCPD. This information is generally provided in the
manufacturer’s coordination tables.

536.4.2.3     Back-up protection of switches, Transfer Switching Equipment (TSE) or impulse
              relays
Switches complying with BS EN 60947-3 or BS EN 60669-2-4, Transfer Switching Equipment (TSE) complying
with BS EN 60947-6-1 and impulse relays complying with BS EN 60669-2-2 are used to switch loads or circuits
(e.g. distribution switchboard, lighting circuit, specific load). These devices do not provide protection against
short-circuit, thus they shall be protected by an overcurrent protective device (OCPD).
NOTE: Fuse combination units to BS EN 60947-3 consist of a switch and integral fuse(s) and have a short-circuit capability
      declared by the manufacturer which does not require the use an upstream OCPD.

Should a short-circuit occur on the load side of a switch, the current will flow through both devices (OCPD and
switch); therefore the let-through energy and the peak current limited by the OCPD need to be compatible with the
short-circuit withstand of the switch, the TSE or the impulse relay.

Figure 536.9 gives a typical schematic for coordination of a switch with a short-circuit protective device (OCPD).

Fig 536.8        Not used




                                                                                                                             179
                                  Fig 536.9 - Coordination between OCPD and switch




      The OCPD may also be situated downstream of the switch, TSE or impulse relay provided that the connection
      between the switch and the downstream OCPD is selected and erected so as to minimize the risk of earth faults and
      short-circuits.

      Switches, Transfer Switching Equipment and impulse relays shall be selected and erected in conjunction with the
      short-circuit protective device declared by the manufacturer in order that their rated conditional short-circuit current
      is equal to or higher than the prospective short-circuit current at the point of installation.

      The rated conditional short-circuit current of the switch can only be obtained by type-testing and thus the data for
      the selection of the OCPD shall be obtained from the manufacturer of the switch, taking into account the rated
      operational current and the rated operational voltage.

      For switches according to BS EN 60947-3, where the OCPD is not specified by the switch manufacturer, an
      alternative method for coordination between the OCPD and the switch is as follows:
           - the rated short-circuit making capacity of the switch is higher than the peak value of the prospective
             short-circuit current at the point of installation, and
           - the OCPD time-current characteristic is within the limits of Icw of the switch, as stated by the manufacturer, or
           - the rated short-circuit making capacity is higher than the peak value of the prospective short-circuit current
             at the point of installation, and
           - the rated short time withstand current is higher than the prospective short-circuit current at the point
             of installation and the corresponding withstand time is longer than the operating time of the SCPD, if
             applicable, or
           - if at the prospective short-circuit current, the protective device has an energy let-through (Ft) and cut-off
             current not exceeding the values for the switch provided by the manufacturer.

      536.4.2.4     Back-up protection of RCCBs
      In this regulation, the OCPD could be replaced by an SCPD.

      RCCBs complying with BS EN 61008 series are intended to protect persons against electric shocks. They may
      also be used to provide protection against fire hazards due to a persistent earth fault. These devices have a limited
      short-circuit current withstand capability, thus they shall be protected by an upstream overcurrent protective device.

      Should a short-circuit occur on the load side of a RCCB, the current will flow through both devices (OCPD and
      RCCB); therefore the let-through energy and the peak current limited by the OCPD need to be compatible with the
      short-circuit withstand capability of the RCCB.

536.4.4        Requirements for selectivity between OCPDs equipped with undervoltage relay

In case of fault (short-circuit or earth fault) a high fault current may generate a voltage drop through the installation.
Voltage drop may also occur in the installation for other reasons (for example, switching and reclosing of
HV switching device).

Where one undervoltage relay is installed in the OCPD on the supply side or elsewhere in the installation, possible
undervoltage relay operation shall not impair selectivity achieved between OCPDs and/or RCDs in series.

                       Fig 536.11 - Selectivity with OCPD and undervoltage relays




For selectivity, undervoltage relay operation shall be time-delayed according to the maximum short-circuit or earth
fault clearance time. In all cases, instructions provided by the manufacturer shall be fulfilled in order not to impair
the safety of the electrical installation.

536.4.5       Low voltage assemblies according to BS EN 61439 series

The interface characteristics of an assembly conforming to BS EN 61439 series shall be compatible with the ratings
of the circuits to which it is connected and with the installation conditions. The characteristics of the assembly
shall be declared by the manufacturer, taking into account the interface characteristics of the relevant BS EN 61439
product standard.

536.4.201     Fault current (short-circuit) ratings

The relevant fault current (short-circuit) rating of the assembly should be equal to or exceed the maximum prospective
fault current at the point of connection to the system.

The terminology used to define the short-circuit rating of an assembly is given in the BS EN 61439 series as follows:
    - rated short-time withstand current, Icw
    - rated peak withstand current, Ipk
    -   rated conditional short-circuit current, Icc.

The assembly manufacturer’s ratings and instructions shall be taken into account.

For an installation with a 230 V single-phase supply rated up to 100 A that is under the control of ordinary persons,
switchgear and controlgear assemblies shall either comply with BS EN 61439-3 having a suitable fault current
(short-circuit) rating for the maximum prospective fault current at the point of connection to the system or be a
consumer unit incorporating components and protective devices specified by the manufacturer complying with
BS EN 61439-3, including the 16 kA conditional short-circuit test described in Annex ZB of the standard.
NOTE:     When the single-phase PSCC value of 19.6 kA is cited from Engineering Recommendation P25, the 16 kA conditional
          rating described in Annex ZB of BS EN 61439-3, for incoming service equipment, will satisfy design requirements
          where the service cable is at least 2 metres in length.
      537.2.3       Devices suitable for isolation shall be selected according to the requirements which are based on the
      overvoltage categories applicable at their point of installation.

      Devices for isolation shall be designed for overvoltage category III or IV except the plug of a plug and socket-outlet
      combination identified in Table 537.4 as suitable for isolation.
      NOTE:      Where electrically powered equipment is within the scope of BS EN 60204, the requirements for isolation of that
                 standard apply.

      537.2.4        Devices for isolation shall be selected and/or installed so as to prevent unwanted or unintentional
      closure (see Regulation 462.3).

      This may be achieved by locating the device in a lockable space or lockable enclosure or by padlocking or by other
      suitable means.

      537.2.5         Provision shall be made for securing off-load isolating devices against unwanted or unintentional
      opening.

      This may be achieved, for example, by locating the device in a lockable space or lockable enclosure or by padlocking.
      Alternatively, the off-load device may be interlocked with a load-breaking one.

      537.2.6         Means of isolation shall preferably be provided by a multipole switching device which disconnects
      all applicable poles of the relevant supply but single-pole devices situated adjacent to each other are not excluded,
      subject to the provisions of Regulation 461.2.

      537.2.7         Each device used for isolation shall be clearly identified by position or durable marking to indicate
      the installation or circuit it isolates.

      537.2.8       Where a link is inserted in the neutral conductor for isolating purposes, the link shall comply with the
      following requirements:
          - it cannot be removed without the use of a tool, and
          - it is accessible to one or more skilled persons only.

      537.3.1.3       Functional switching devices may control the current without necessarily opening the corresponding
      poles.
      NOTE:      Semiconductor switching devices and some control auxiliaries are examples of devices capable of interrupting the
                 current in the circuit but not opening the corresponding poles.

      537.3.2         Devices for switching off for mechanical maintenance

                 mechanical maintenance of that standard apply.

      537.3.2.2       Devices for switching off for mechanical maintenance shall be inserted in the main supply circuit.

      Where a switch is provided for this purpose, it shall be capable of cutting off the full load current of the relevant
      part of the installation.

      Interruption of a circuit for the control of mechanical movement is permitted only where a condition equivalent to
      the direct interruption of the main supply is provided by one of the following:
         (i) Supplementary safeguards, such as mechanical retainers
        (ii) Compliance with the requirements of a British or Harmonized Standard specification for the control devices
             used.




186
537.3.2.3     Devices for switching off for mechanical maintenance or control switches for such devices shall

durable marking so as to be identifiable for their intended use.

537.3.3        Devices for emergency switching off

NOTE: Emergency switching off is an emergency operation intended to switch off the supply of electrical energy to all or part
      of an installation where a risk of electric shock or another risk of electrical origin is involved.

537.3.3.1       Selection and erection of devices for emergency switching off shall be in accordance with the

NOTE: Where electrically powered equipment is within the scope of BS EN 60204, the requirements for emergency switching
         off of that standard apply.

537.3.3.2       The devices for emergency switching off shall be capable of breaking the full load current of the
relevant parts of the installation taking into account stalled motor currents where appropriate.

537.3.3.3       Means for emergency switching off may consist of:
     -   one switching device capable of directly cutting off the appropriate supply, or
     -   a combination of devices activated by a single action for the purpose of cutting off the appropriate supply.

Plugs and socket-outlets shall not be provided for use as means for emergency switching off.

installation.

The operation of the emergency switching device shall have priority over any other function relative to safety and
shall not be inhibited by any other operation of the installation.

537.4          Firefighter's switches
537.4.1         Firefighter's   switches shall comply with B S EN 60669-2-6 or B S EN 60947-3.




                                                                                                                                187
537.4.2       A firefighter's switch shall be provided in the low voltage circuit supplying:
   (i) outdoor lighting installations operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage, and
  (ii) indoor discharge lighting installations operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage.

This requirement does not apply to a portable discharge lighting luminaire or to a sign of rating not exceeding
100 W and fed from an accessible socket-outlet.
NOTE:      Installations in certain premises subject to licensing conditions, such as petrol station forecourts, may require the
           installation of a firefighter’s switch.

537.4.2.1        Every outdoor installation on each single premises should wherever practicable be controlled by a

      -   'ON' and 'OFF' positions, in letters not less than 10 mm high;
      -   letters reading 'FIREFIGHTER'S SWITCH’ or 'FIRE SWITCH' in letters not less than 10 mm high.

Once installed, the handle off position shall be up.
NOTE:      The 'ON' position means powered and the 'OFF' position means unpowered.


538            MONITORING DEVICES

538.1           Insulation monitoring devices (IMDs) for IT systems

538.1.1         General

IMDs shall be in accordance with BS EN 61557-8.

An IMD is intended to permanently monitor the insulation resistance of an IT system and provides an alarm where
the insulation resistance R f is below the response value Ra.

R a is the response value of the IMD as described in BS EN 61557-8.
R f is the insulation resistance between the system to which it is connected and either the earth, the PE connection or
another reference point for protective equipotential bonding.

Examples of these systems would be an electrical installation, a mobile generator or a safety service.

An IMD shall be installed in an IT system where selected to meet with the requirement of Regulation 411.6.4.

IMDs shall be installed as close as practicable to the origin of the part of the installation to be monitored.

Instructions shall be provided indicating that when the IMD detects an insulation fault to earth, the insulation fault
shall be located and eliminated in order to restore normal operating conditions with the shortest practicable delay.

Where the IT system is used for continuity of supply, the occurrence of a first insulation fault shall be indicated at a
suitable location so it is audible and/or visible by instructed or skilled person(s).
NOTE:      This alarm may be relayed through a building management system (BMS).
It is recommended to use an IMD that signals an interruption of the measurement connections to the system
conductors and earth.

538.1.2        Installation of insulation monitoring devices

Where a neutral conductor is distributed, an insulation monitoring device (IMD) may be connected to the neutral
conductor. In this case, no overcurrent protective device shall be inserted in the conductor connecting the IMD to
the neutral.
An IMD shall be connected symmetrically or unipolarly between the live conductors and earth or the PE connection
or another reference point for protective equipotential bonding.
Where the neutral conductor is not distributed, the ‘line’ terminal of the IMD may be connected:
  (i) either to an artificial neutral point with the three impedances connected to line conductors, or
   (ii) to a line conductor.
Where, in a polyphase system, the IMD is connected between one line conductor and earth, it shall be suitable to
withstand at least the line-to-line voltage between its ‘line’ terminal and its ‘earth’ terminal.
NOTE: This voltage appears across these two terminals in the case of a single insulation fault on another line conductor.

For DC installations, the ‘line’ terminal(s) of the IMD shall be connected either directly to the midpoint, if any, or
to one or all of the supply conductors.
The supply circuit of IMD shall be connected either to the installation on the same circuit of the connecting point of
the ‘line’ terminal and as close as possible to the origin of the system, or to an auxiliary source.
The connecting point to the installation shall be selected in such a way that the IMD is able to monitor the insulation
of the installation in all operating conditions.
Where the installation is supplied from more than one power supply, connected in parallel, one IMD per supply shall
be used, provided they are interlocked in such a way that only one IMD remains connected to the system. All other
IMDs monitor the disconnected power supply, enabling the reconnection of this supply without any pre-existing
insulation fault.
IMDs shall be able to measure the insulation resistance of the system if DC components caused by electronic
equipment, e.g. rectifiers or convertors, are contained in the fault current.

538.1.3        Setting of the insulation monitoring device

The IMD shall have a selection of setting values and be adjusted to suit the respective installation.
When operating normally with the maximum of loads connected, the IMD shall be set to a lower value corresponding
to the normal insulation of the system.
NOTE: A value of 100 Q/V (300 Q/V for pre-warning) of the rated system voltage is an example of typical setting values.

Where IMDs are installed in locations where ordinary persons have access to their use they shall be selected and/
or installed in such a way that it shall be impossible to modify the settings except by the use of a key, a tool or a
password.

538.2          Equipment for insulation fault location in IT systems
Equipment for insulation fault location shall be in accordance with BS EN 61557-9. Where an IT system has been
selected for continuity of service, it is recommended to combine the IMD with devices enabling the fault location
on load. Their function is to indicate the faulty circuit when the IMD has detected an insulation fault.

538.3          Monitoring of off-line circuits
The insulation monitoring of circuits switched off may be carried out in TN, TT and IT systems with insulation
monitoring devices (IMDs) provided that the IMD is automatically deactivated whenever the safety equipment is
activated. A prerequisite for it is that the monitored electrical circuits are isolated from all poles of the system.
NOTE: As an example, this can be applicable to a circuit comprising safety equipment which is normally de-energized such
      that the safety equipment is allowed to work without intervention of supply during the emergency.

The reduction of the insulation level shall be indicated locally by either a visual or an audible signal with the option
of remote indication.
If the equipment is disconnected from the installation during the off-load insulation measuring process, the insulation
levels to be measured are generally very high. The alarm threshold should be above 300 kQ.

                                                                                                                            189
A53.1        Basis of correct coordination
The basis of the coordination between electrical equipment is to take advantage of the correct combination of their
electrical characteristics in order not to impair:
    - the safety of an installation (i.e. to avoid equipment combustion due to an electrical fault). Combined
      short-circuit protection of OCPDs and back-up protection by an OCPD relate to the safety of an installation
    - the safety due to continuity of service, if needed (i.e. to restrict disconnection to the faulty circuit in case of
      overcurrent or fault to earth).

Selectivity between electrical devices provides continuity of service and thus avoids dangers linked to the loss of
supply of specific circuits.

A53.2        Parameters
The parameters for the correct coordination between electrical devices may be:
    - design current
    -   prospective short-circuit or fault current
    - operating time of devices
    - system voltage
    - energy (let-through I2t values)
    - peak let-through current.

In addition, for fuses, the following parameters should be considered:
    -   pre-arcing I2t and pre-arcing time
    - operating I 2t and operating time.

A53.3         Between circuit-breakers or circuit-breaker and CPS or circuit-breaker and overload
              relay or circuit-breaker and motor starter
Selectivity in case of overload is verified by the comparison of time/current characteristics of the devices involved.
The maximum operating time of the device on the load side must be lower than the non-tripping time of the
circuit-breaker for any overload current. Separation of the characteristics in both the time and current axes provides
selective operation in this zone.

A53.4         Between fuses
Selectivity in case of overload is verified by the comparison of time/current characteristics of the fuses involved.
The total operating time of the fuse on the load side must be lower than the pre-arcing time of the fuse on the supply
side. Fuses to BS EN 60269-2 of the same utilization category (e.g. type gG) with rated current of 16 A and above
will provide total selectivity if the ratio of the rated currents is 1.6:1 or greater. Separation of the characteristics in
both the time and current axes provides selective operation in this zone.

A53.5         Between circuit-breaker (upstream) and fuse (downstream)
Selectivity in case of overload is verified by comparison of the time/current characteristics, taking into account
the trip setting of the circuit-breaker where applicable. When using published time-current characteristics, the
maximum operating time curve must be taken for the downstream device and the minimum operating time curve
must be taken for the upstream device. Separation of the characteristics in both the time and current axes provides
selective operation in this zone.

A53.6         Between fuse (upstream) and circuit-breaker (downstream)
Selectivity in case of overload is verified by comparison of the time/current characteristics, taking into account the
trip setting of the circuit-breaker where applicable. The maximum operating time of the circuit-breaker as given by
the manufacturer must be lower than the minimum pre-arcing time of the fuse as given by the product standard.
Separation of the characteristics in both the time and current axes provides selective operation in this zone.




                                                                                                                              193
A53.7         Between circuit-breakers
Generally, reference should be made to the manufacturers’ documentation.

In principle, selectivity is assured up to the fault current level at which the peak current let-through o f the downstream
circuit-breaker is less than the peak value corresponding to the instantaneous tripping level of the upstream
circuit-break er. Where the upstream circuit-breaker has dedicated selective behaviour, the selectivity limit might be higher.

A53.8         Between fuses
Selectivity in case of short-circuit is verified by comparison of the Ft values. The maximum operating Ft value of
the fuse on the load side should be lower than the minimum pre-arcing Ft value of the fuse on the supply side. Fuses
to BS EN 60269-1 of the same utilization category (e.g. type gG) with rated current of 16 A and above will provide
total selectivity if the ratio of the rated currents is 1.6:1 or greater.

A53.9         Between circuit-breaker (upstream) and fuse (downstream)
The peak let-through current of the fuse should be lower than the minimum instantaneous tripping current of the
circuit-breaker.

Data for peak values of fuses should be taken from the relevant standard or the manufacturers’ documentation. If
data is taken from the manufacturer, this should be stated in the documentation of the installation.

A53.10        Between fuse (upstream) and circuit-breaker (downstream)
The minimum pre-arcing Ft value of the fuse should be higher than the maximum let-through Ft value of the
circuit-breaker for any short-circuit current up to the maximum prospective short-circuit current to be considered.
Data for Ft values of fuses should be taken from the relevant standard/or the manufacturers’ documentation. If
data is taken from the manufacturer, this should be stated in the documentation of the installation. The maximum
let-through Ft value of the circuit-breaker should be obtained from the manufacturers’ data.

542           EARTHING ARRANGEMENTS

542.1          General requirements
542.1.1        The earthing arrangements may be used jointly or separately for protective and functional purposes,
according to the requirements of the installation.
542.1.201     The main earthing terminal shall be connected with Earth by one of the methods described in
Regulations 542.1.2.1 to 542.1.2.3, as appropriate to the type of system of which the installation is to form a part
and in compliance with Regulations 542.1.3.1 and 542.1.3.2.
NOTE:     Refer to Part 2 and Appendix 9 for definitions of systems.

542.1.2        Supply arrangements

542.1.2.1      For a TN-S system, means shall be provided for the main earthing terminal of the installation to be
connected to the earthed point of the source of energy. Part of the connection may be formed by the distributor’s
lines and equipment.
542.1.2.2      For a TN-C-S system, where protective multiple earthing is provided, means shall be provided for the
main earthing terminal of the installation to be connected by the distributor to the neutral of the source of energy.
542.1.2.3      For a TT or IT system, the main earthing terminal shall be connected via an earthing conductor to an
earth electrode complying with Regulation 542.2.
542.1.2.4      Where the supply to an installation is at high voltage, protection against faults between the high
voltage supply and earth shall be provided in accordance with Section 442.

542.1.3        Installation earthing arrangements

542.1.3.1     The earthing arrangements shall be such that:
   (i) the value of impedance from the consumer’s main earthing terminal to the earthed point of the supply for
       TN systems, or to Earth for TT and IT systems, is in accordance with the protective and functional
       requirements of the installation, and considered to be continuously effective, and
  (ii) earth fault currents and protective conductor currents which may occur are carried without danger,
       particularly from thermal, thermomechanical and electromechanical stresses, and
 (iii) they are adequately robust or have additional mechanical protection appropriate to the assessed conditions
       of external influence.
542.1.3.2       Precautions shall be taken against the risk of damage to other metallic parts through electrolysis.
542.1.3.3        Where a number of installations have separate earthing arrangements, any protective conductors
common to any of these installations shall either be capable of carrying the maximum fault current likely to flow
through them or be earthed within one installation only and insulated from the earthing arrangements of any other
installation. In the latter circumstances, if the protective conductor forms part of a cable, the protective conductor
shall be earthed only in the installation containing the associated protective device.

542.2          Earth electrodes
542.2.1        The design used for, and the construction of, an earth electrode shall be such as to withstand damage
and to take account of possible increase in resistance due to corrosion.




                                                                                                                         197
      542.2.2        Suitable earth electrodes shall be used. The following types of earth electrode are recognized for the
      purposes of the Regulations:
         (i)   Earth rods or pipes

        (vi) Lead sheaths and other metal coverings of cables, where not precluded by Regulation 542.2.5
       (vii) other suitable underground metalwork.
      NOTE: Further information on earth electrodes can be found in BS 7430.

      542.2.3         Where foundation earth electrodes are installed, the materials and dimensions of the earth electrodes
      shall be selected to withstand corrosion and to have adequate mechanical strength.
      NOTE: If a lightning protection system (LPS) is present, BS EN 62305-1 applies.

      542.2.4         The type and embedded depth of an earth electrode shall be such that soil drying and freezing will
      not increase its resistance above the required value.

      542.2.5          The use, as an earth electrode, of the lead sheath or other metal covering of a cable shall be subject
      to all of the following conditions:

        (ii) The sheath or covering shall be in effective contact with Earth
        (iii) The consent of the owner of the cable shall be obtained
        (iv) Arrangements shall exist for the owner of the electrical installation to be warned of any proposed change to
             the cable which might affect its suitability as an earth electrode.

      542.2.6         A metallic pipe for gases or flammable liquids shall not be used as an earth electrode. The metallic
      pipe of a water utility supply shall not be used as an earth electrode. Other metallic water supply pipework shall not
      be used as an earth electrode unless precautions are taken against its removal and it has been considered for such a use.

      542.2.7         An earth electrode shall not consist of a metal object immersed in water.

      542.2.8       Where an earth electrode consists of parts that must be connected together, connections shall be made
      by welding, pressure connectors, clamps or other suitable mechanical connectors.

      542.3          Earthing conductors

      550.1         Scope

      Chapter 55 specifies requirements and recommendations for the selection and erection of low voltage electrical
      equipment not covered by other parts of BS 7671 except Part 7 and Chapter 82, intended to be part of the fixed
      installation.

      551           LOW VOLTAGE GENERATING SETS

      551.1          Scope

      This section applies to low voltage and extra-low voltage installations which incorporate generating sets intended to
      supply, either continuously or occasionally, all or part of the installation. Requirements are included for installations
      with the following supply arrangements:
         (i) Supply to an installation which is not connected to a system for distribution of electricity to the public
        (ii) Supply to an installation as an alternative to a system for distribution of electricity to the public
        (iii) Supply to an installation in parallel with a system for distribution of electricity to the public
        (iv) Appropriate combinations of the above.

      This section does not apply to self-contained items of extra-low voltage electrical equipment which incorporate
      both the source of energy and the energy-using load and for which a specific product standard exists that includes
      the requirements for electrical safety.
      NOTE:     Where a generating set with an output not exceeding 16 A is to be connected in parallel with a system for distribution
                of electricity to the public, procedures for informing the electricity distributor are given in the Electricity Safety,
                Quality and Continuity Regulations (ESQCR). In addition to the ESQCR requirements, where a generating set with
                an output exceeding 16 A is to be connected in parallel with a system for distribution of electricity to the public,
                requirements of the electricity distributor should be ascertained before the generating set is connected. Requirements
                of the distributor for the connection of units rated up to 16 A are given in BS EN 50549-1.

      551.1.1         Generating sets with the following power sources are considered:
         (i) Combustion engines
        (ii) Turbines
        (iii) Electric motors
        (iv) Photovoltaic cells
        (v) Batteries
        (vi) Other suitable sources.

      551.1.2         Generating sets with the following electrical characteristics are considered:
         (i) Mains-excited and separately excited synchronous generators
        (ii) Mains-excited and self-excited asynchronous generators
        (iii) Mains-commutated and self-commutated static convertors with or without bypass facilities.

      551.1.3         The use of generating sets for the following purposes is considered:
         (i) Supply to permanent installations
        (ii) Supply to temporary installations
        (iii) Supply to mobile equipment which is not connected to a permanent fixed installation
        (iv) Supply to mobile units (Section 717 also applies).

      551.2          General requirements

      551.2.1         The means of excitation and commutation shall be appropriate for the intended use of the generating
      set and the safety and proper functioning of other sources of supply shall not be impaired by the generating set.

      551.2.2         The prospective short-circuit current and prospective earth fault current shall be assessed for each
      source of supply or combination of sources which can operate independently of other sources or combinations. The
      short-circuit rating of protective devices within the installation and, where appropriate, connected to a system for
      distribution of electricity to the public, shall not be exceeded for any of the intended methods of operation of the
      sources.



208
551.2.3         Where the generating set is intended to provide a supply to an installation which is not connected to
a system for distribution of electricity to the public or to provide a supply as a switched alternative to such a system,
the capacity and operating characteristics of the generating set shall be such that danger or damage to equipment
does not arise after the connection or disconnection of any intended load as a result of the deviation of the voltage
or frequency from the intended operating range. Means shall be provided to automatically disconnect such parts of
the installation as may be necessary if the capacity of the generating set is exceeded.
NOTE 1 : Consideration should be given to the intended duty cycle and size of individual connected loads as a proportion of the
         capacity of the generating set and to the starting characteristics of any connected electric motors.
NOTE 2: Consideration should be given to the power factor specified for protective devices in the installation.
NOTE 3: The installation of a generating set within an existing building or installation may change the conditions of external
         influence for the installation (see Part 3), for example by the introduction of moving parts, parts at high temperature
         or by the presence of flammable fluids and noxious gases, etc.

551.2.4       Provision for isolation shall meet the requirements of Chapter 46 and Section 537 for each source or
combination of sources of supply.

551.3          Protective measure: Extra-low voltage provided by SELV or PELV
551.3.1        Additional requirements for SELV and PELV where the installation is supplied from
               more than one source

Where a SELV or PELV system may be supplied by more than one source, the requirements of Regulation 414.3
shall apply to each source. Where one or more of the sources is earthed, the requirements for PELV systems in
Regulation 414.4 shall apply.

If one or more of the sources does not meet the requirements of Regulation 414.3, the system shall be treated as a
FELV system and the requirements of Regulation 411.7 shall apply.

551.3.2        Where it is necessary to maintain the supply to an extra-low voltage system following the loss of
one or more sources of supply, each source of supply or combination of sources of supply which can operate
independently of other sources or combinations shall be capable of supplying the intended load of the extra-low
voltage system. Provisions shall be made so that loss of the low voltage supply to an extra-low voltage source does
not lead to danger or damage to other extra-low voltage equipment.
NOTE: Such provisions may be necessary in supplies for safety services (see Chapter 56).

551.4          Fault protection
551.4.1       Fault protection shall be provided for the installation in respect of each source of supply or
combination of sources of supply that can operate independently of other sources or combinations of sources.

The fault protective provisions shall be selected or precautions shall be taken so that where fault protective provisions
are achieved in different ways within the same installation or part of an installation according to the active sources
of supply, no influence shall occur or conditions arise that could impair the effectiveness of the fault protective
provisions.
NOTE: This might, for example, require the use of a transformer providing electrical separation between parts of the installation
      using different earthing systems.

551.4.2      The generating set shall be connected so that any provision within the installation for protection by
RCDs in accordance with Chapter 41 remains effective for every intended combination of sources of supply.
NOTE: Connection of live parts of the generator with Earth may affect the protective measure.

551.4.3        Protection by automatic disconnection of supply

551.4.3.1     Protection by automatic disconnection of supply shall be provided in accordance with Section 411,
except as modified for particular cases by Regulation 551.4.3.2, 551.4.3.3 or 551.4.4.

551.4.3.2   Additional requirements for installations where the generating set provides a
switched alternative to the system for distribution of electricity to the public (standby systems)
551.4.3.2.1 Protection by automatic disconnection of supply shall not rely upon the connection to the earthed
point of the system for distribution of electricity to the public when the generator is operating as a switched alternative
to a TN system. A suitable means of earthing shall be provided.




                                                                                                                                    209
      This regulation does not apply to a static convertor provided to supply specific items of current-using equipment
      within the final circuit to which it is connected.

      551.7.3        In selecting and using a generating set to run in parallel with the system for distribution of electricity
      to the public, care shall be taken to avoid adverse effects to that system and to other installations in respect of
      power factor, voltage changes, harmonic distortion, unbalance, starting, synchronizing or voltage fluctuation effects.
      Where synchronization is necessary, the use of an automatic synchronizing system which considers frequency,
      phase sequence and voltage is to be preferred.

      551.7.4         Means of automatic switching shall be provided to disconnect the generating set from the system for
      distribution of electricity to the public in the event of loss of that supply or deviation of the voltage or frequency at
      the supply terminals from declared values.

      For a generating set with an output exceeding 16 A, the type of protection and the sensitivity and operating times
      depend upon the protection of the system for distribution of electricity to the public and the number of generating
      sets connected and shall be agreed by the distributor. For a generating set with an output not exceeding 16 A, the
      settings shall comply with BS EN 50549-1.

      In the case of the presence of a static convertor, the means of switching shall be provided on the load side of the
      static convertor.

      551.7.5          Means shall be provided to prevent the connection of a generating set to the system for distribution
      of electricity to the public in the event of loss of that supply or deviation of the voltage or frequency at the supply
      terminals from values required by Regulation 551.7.4.
      NOTE: For a generating set with an output not exceeding 16 Aintended to operate in parallel with a system for distribution of
                electricity to the public the requirements are given in BS EN 50549-1.

      551.7.6          Means shall be provided to enable the generating set to be isolated from the system for distribution
      of electricity to the public. For a generating set with an output exceeding 16 A, the accessibility of this means of
      isolation shall comply with national rules and distribution system operator requirements. For a generating set with
      an output not exceeding 16 A, the accessibility of this means of isolation shall comply with BS EN 50549-1.

      551.7.7          Where a generating set may operate as a switched alternative to the system for distribution of
      electricity to the public, the installation shall also comply with Regulation 551.6.

      551.8          Requirements for installations incorporating stationary batteries

      551.8.1         Stationary batteries shall be installed so that they are accessible only to skilled or instructed persons.
      NOTE: This generally requires the battery to be installed in a secure location or, for smaller batteries, a secure enclosure.

      The location or enclosure shall be adequately ventilated.

      551.8.2       Battery connections shall have basic protection by insulation or enclosures or shall be arranged so that
      two bare conductive parts having between them a potential difference exceeding 120 volts cannot be inadvertently
      touched simultaneously.

      552            ROTATING MACHINES
      NOTE: See also Regulation 463.3 Motor control.

      552.1          Rotating machines

      552.1.1        All equipment, including cable, of every circuit carrying the starting, accelerating and load currents
      of a motor shall be suitable for a current at least equal to the full-load current rating of the motor when rated in
      accordance with the appropriate British or Harmonized Standard. Where the motor is intended for intermittent duty
      and for frequent starting and stopping, account shall be taken of any cumulative effects of the starting or braking
      currents upon the temperature rise of the equipment of the circuit.

      552.1.2        Every electric motor having a rating exceeding 0.37 kW shall be provided with control equipment
      incorporating means of protection against overload of the motor. This requirement does not apply to a motor
      incorporated in an item of current-using equipment complying as a whole with an appropriate British or Harmonized
      Standard.

      552.1.3         Except where failure to start after a brief interruption would be likely to cause greater danger, every
      motor shall be provided with means to prevent automatic restarting after a stoppage due to a drop in voltage or
      failure of supply, where unexpected restarting of the motor might cause danger. This requirement does not preclude
      arrangements for starting a motor at intervals by an automatic control device, where other adequate precautions are
      taken against danger from unexpected restarting.

      554           CURRENT-USING EQUIPMENT

      554.1          Electrode water heaters and boilers
      554.1.1        Every electrode water heater and electrode boiler shall be connected to an AC system only, and shall
      be selected and erected in accordance with the appropriate requirements of this section.

      554.1.2         The supply to the electrode water heater or electrode boiler shall be controlled by a linked
      circuit-breaker arranged to disconnect the supply from all electrodes simultaneously and provided with an overcurrent
      protective device in each conductor feeding an electrode.

      554.1.3        The earthing of the electrode water heater or electrode boiler shall comply with the requirements of
      Chapter 54 and, in addition, the shell of the electrode water heater or electrode boiler shall be bonded to the metallic
      sheath and armour, if any, of the incoming supply cable. The protective conductor shall be connected to the shell of
      the electrode water heater or electrode boiler and shall comply with Regulation 543.1.1.

      554.1.4         Where an electrode water heater or electrode boiler is directly connected to a supply at a voltage
      exceeding low voltage, the installation shall include an RCD arranged to disconnect the supply from the electrodes
      on the occurrence of a sustained earth leakage current in excess of 10 % of the rated current of the electrode water
      heater or electrode boiler under normal conditions of operation, except that if in any instance a higher value is
      essential for stability of operation of the electrode water heater or electrode boiler, the value may be increased to a
      maximum of 15 %. A time delay may be incorporated in the device to prevent unnecessary operation in the event of
      imbalance of short duration.

      554.1.5         Where an electrode water heater or electrode boiler is connected to a three-phase low voltage supply,
      the shell of the electrode water heater or electrode boiler shall be connected to the neutral of the supply as well as

      boiler is single-phase and one electrode is connected to a neutral conductor earthed by the distributor, the shell of
      the electrode water heater or electrode boiler shall be connected to the neutral of the supply as well as to the earthing
      conductor.

      554.1.7         Where the electrode water heater or electrode boiler is not piped to a water supply or in physical
      contact with any earthed metal, and where the electrodes and the water in contact with the electrodes are so shielded
      in insulating material that they cannot be touched while the electrodes are live, a fuse in the line conductor may be
      substituted for the circuit-breaker required under Regulation 554.1.2 and the shell of the electrode water heater or
      electrode boiler need not be connected to the neutral of the supply.

      554.2          Heaters for liquids or other substances having immersed heating elements
      554.2.1        Every heater for liquid or other substance shall incorporate or be provided with an automatic device

      554.3          Water heaters having immersed and uninsulated heating elements
      554.3.1        Every single-phase water heater or boiler having an uninsulated heating element immersed in the
      water shall comply with the requirements of Regulations 554.3.2 and 554.3.3. This type of water heater or boiler is
      deemed not to be an electrode water heater or electrode boiler.

      554.3.2          All metal parts of the heater or boiler which are in contact with the water (other than current-carrying
      parts) shall be solidly and metallically connected to a metal water pipe through which the water supply to the heater
      or boiler is provided, and that water pipe shall be connected to the main earthing terminal by means independent of
      the circuit protective conductor.

      554.3.3        The heater or boiler shall be permanently connected to the electricity supply through a double-pole
      linked switch which is either separate from and within easy reach of the heater or boiler or is incorporated therein,
      and the wiring from the heater or boiler shall be connected directly to that switch without the use of a plug and
      socket-outlet.

      554.3.4         Before a heater or boiler of the type referred to in Regulation 554.3.1 is connected, the installer shall
      confirm that no single-pole switch, non-linked circuit-breaker or fuse is fitted in the neutral conductor in any part of
      the circuit between the heater or boiler and the origin of the installation.

      554.4          Heating conductors and cables
      NOTE:     For electric floor and ceiling heating systems in buildings the requirements of Section 753 must also be met.

      557.3.2.2       Auxiliary circuit supplied from the main circuit via transformer
      Where an auxiliary circuit is supplied by more than one transformer, they shall be connected in parallel both on the
      primary and secondary sides.

      557.3.3         Auxiliary circuit supplied by an independent source

      Where an independent source is used a loss of supply or undervoltage of the main circuit source shall be detected.
      An independent auxiliary circuit shall not create a hazardous situation.
      NOTE:     Batteries and a power supply system independent of the mains are examples of independent sources.
      557.3.4         Auxiliary circuits with or without connection to earth

      557.3.4.1       Generali
      An auxiliary circuit shall comply with the earthing requirements of BS 7671 except as modified by
      Regulation 557.3.4.2 or 557.3.4.3.
      NOTE 1 : It depends on the requirements for an auxiliary circuit as to whether it is operated earthed or unearthed. For example,
               in an earthed auxiliary circuit an earth fault in a non-earthed conductor leads to disconnection of the power supply of
               the auxiliary circuit; in an unearthed auxiliary circuit, an earth fault in a conductor leads only to a signal from the IMD
               (see Regulation 557.3.4.3).
      NOTE 2: The use of unearthed auxiliary circuits should be considered where high reliability is required.

      557.3.4.2       Earthed auxiliary circuit
      An earthed auxiliary circuit supplied via a transformer shall be connected to earth only at one point on the secondary
      side of the transformer. The connection to earth shall be situated close to the transformer. The connection shall be
      easily accessible and capable of being isolated for insulation measurement.




216
557.3.4.3       Unearthed auxiliary circuit
Except in the case of a SELV or PELV circuit, if an auxiliary circuit is operated unearthed via a transformer,
an insulation monitoring device (IMD) according to BS EN 61557-8 shall be installed on the secondary side.
Consideration shall be given to the use of risk assessment to determine whether the signal from the IMD is to initiate
an acoustic and/or a flash alarm, or be transmitted to a monitoring system.

557.3.5         Power supplies for auxiliary circuits

557.3.5.1       General
The rated voltage of an auxiliary circuit, and the components used in the circuit, shall be compatible with the supply
to that circuit.
NOTE 1: If the supply voltage is too low for the design of the circuit then the operation will not be reliable for the proper
           function of relays.

Account shall be taken of the effects of voltage drop on the electrical equipment of the auxiliary circuit, including
inrush and starting currents.
N O TE 2 : Motors starting direct-on-line can draw a starting current from the main circuit that will reduce the supply voltage to
           an auxiliary circuit dependent on the main circuit, below the minimum operating voltage of the associated switchgear.

557.3.5.2       Standby power supply or power supply for safety services
Where a standby power supply or a power supply from a generating set is used to supply auxiliary circuits, the
frequency variation shall be taken into account.

557.3.5.3       AC supply
The nominal voltage of control circuits shall preferably not exceed:
   (i) 230 V for circuits with 50 Hz nominal frequency
   (ii) 277 V for circuits with 60 Hz nominal frequency

respectively, taking into account voltage tolerances according to BS EN 60038.
NOTE:      The dimensioning of cable length with respect to the conductor capacitances, e.g. connection to a limit switch,
           needs to be coordinated with the selected relays or solenoid valves. The standing voltage caused by high conductor
           capacitances may impair the switching off of relays or solenoid valves.

557.3.5.4       DC supply

557.3.5.4.1         Supply by a power system
The nominal voltage of control circuits shall preferably not exceed 220 V.

557.3.5.4.2         Supply by batteries
Where batteries are used as a power supply for auxiliary circuits, the voltage fluctuation due to charging or
discharging shall not exceed voltage tolerances specified in BS EN 60038, unless the auxiliary circuit is specifically
designed to compensate for such voltage fluctuation.
557.3.6         Protective measures

557.3.6.1       Protection of wiring systems
N O T E 1 : In the case of extended auxiliary circuits it is necessary to check that the required operating current of the protective
          device will be achieved also at the far end of the respective cables or conductors, Regulation 433.1.

Single-phase earthed AC auxiliary circuits supplied on the secondary side of the transformer for an auxiliary supply
and earthed DC auxiliary circuits are permitted to be protected by single-pole devices. The protective devices shall
only be inserted in conductors which are not connected directly to earth.

In unearthed AC or DC auxiliary circuits, short-circuit protection shall be provided for all line conductors.
N O T E 2 : The use of protective devices which disconnect all lines of an unearthed auxiliary circuit will aid fault diagnosis and
          maintenance activities.

If the short-circuit protective device on the primary side of the transformer for an auxiliary circuit is selected so that
it also protects against short-circuit current on the secondary side, a protective device on the secondary side of the
transformer may be omitted.
N O T E 3 : For a fault on the transformer secondary side, the magnitude of the short-circuit current on the primary side depends
          also on the impedance of the transformer.



                                                                                                                                        217
          557.3.6.2         Protection against short-circuit
          Switching contacts of electrical switching devices of the auxiliary circuit shall be protected against damage caused
          by short-circuit currents, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

          557.4             Characteristics of cables and conductors

          557.4.1           Minimum cross-sectional areas

          In order to provide adequate mechanical strength, the following minimum cross-sectional areas indicated in Table
          55.2 shall be met. If there are special mechanical strength requirements for cables or conductors, then a larger cross-
          sectional area of conductor, selected in accordance with Chapter 52, may be required.

               Other auxiliary circuits may need a larger cross-sectional area of copper conductor, e.g. for measuring.

          NOTE:        The cross-sectional area of copper conductors is derived from Section 524.

          557.5             Requirements for auxiliary circuits used for measurement
          557.5.1           General

          557.5.2           Auxiliary circuits for direct measurement of electrical quantities

          An auxiliary circuit for direct measurement of electrical quantities shall be protected against the effects of a fault by
          one of the following means:
                (i)   Provision of a device for protection against fault current in accordance with Section 434. Where operation of
                      the device could cause danger, or lead to a hazardous situation, such operation shall also cause disconnection
                      of the main circuit
               (ii) Simultaneous fulfilment of conditions (a) and (b) of Regulation 434.3.

          Where a measurement device is connected to the main circuit via a current transformer, the following requirements
          shall be taken into account:
                (i) The secondary side of the transformer in a low voltage installation shall not be earthed, except where the
                    measurement can only be carried out with a connection to earth
               (ii) Protective devices interrupting the circuit shall not be used on the secondary side of the transformer
               (iii) Conductors on the secondary side of the transformer shall be insulated for the highest voltage of any live
                     parts or shall be installed such that their insulation cannot come into contact with other live parts, e.g.
                     contact with busbars
               (iv) Terminals for temporary measurements shall be provided.

          The above requirements do not apply to summation current transformers where hazardous voltages do not occur,

         (f) Long break: an automatic supply available in more than 15 s.

      560.4.2        The essential equipment for safety services shall be compatible with the changeover time in order to
      maintain the specified operation.

      560.5         GENERAL

      560.5.1         Safety services may be required to operate at all relevant times including during mains and local
      supply failure and through fire conditions. To meet this requirement specific sources, equipment, circuits and wiring
      are necessary. Some applications also have particular requirements, as in Regulations 560.5.2 and 560.5.3.

      560.5.2        For safety services required to operate in fire conditions, the following two conditions shall be fulfilled:
         (i) An electrical source for safety supply shall be so selected as to maintain a supply of adequate duration, and
        (ii) all equipment of safety services shall be so provided, either by construction or by erection, with fire-resisting
             protection of adequate duration.
      NOTE: The safety source is generally additional to the normal source. The normal source is, for example, the public supply
            network.

      560.5.3       Where automatic disconnection of supply is used as a protective measure against electric shock,
      non-disconnection on the first fault is preferred. In IT systems, continuous insulation monitoring devices shall be
      provided which give an audible and visual indication in the event of a first fault.

      560.5.4         A failure in the control or bus system of a normal installation shall not adversely affect the function
      of safety services.

      560.6         ELECTRICAL SOURCES FOR SAFETY SERVICES

      560.6.1        The following electrical sources for safety services are recognized:
         (i) Storage batteries
        (ii) Primary cells
       (iii) Generator sets independent of the normal supply
        (iv) A separate feeder of the supply network that is effectively independent of the normal feeder.

      560.6.2       Safety sources for safety services shall be installed as fixed equipment and in such a manner that they
      cannot be adversely affected by failure of the normal source.

      560.6.3      Safety sources shall be installed in a suitable location and be accessible only to skilled or instructed
      persons (BA5 or BA4).

      560.6.4      The location of the safety source shall be properly and adequately ventilated so that exhaust gases,
      smoke or fumes from the safety source cannot penetrate areas occupied by one or more persons.

      560.6.5         Separated independent feeders from a distributor’s network shall not serve as electrical sources for
      safety services unless assurance can be obtained that the two supplies are unlikely to fail concurrently.
      NOTE: Guidance on the specification of wiring systems for safety services may be found in BS 8519.

      560.6.6        The safety source shall have sufficient capability to supply its related safety service.

      560.6.7         A safety source may, in addition, be used for purposes other than safety services, provided that the
      availability for safety services is not thereby impaired. A fault occurring in a circuit for purposes other than safety
      services shall not cause the interruption of any circuit for safety services.


226
560.6.8         Special requirements for safety services having sources not capable of operation in
                parallel

560.6.8.1        Adequate precautions shall be taken to avoid the paralleling of sources.
NOTE:      This may be achieved by mechanical interlocking.

560.6.8.2        Short-circuit protection and fault protection shall be provided for each source.

560.6.9         Special requirements for safety services having sources capable of operation in
                parallel

Short-circuit protection and fault protection shall be effective irrespective of whether the installation is supplied
separately by either of the two sources or by both in parallel.
NOTE 1 : The parallel operation of a private source with the public supply network is subject to authorization by the distribution
          network operator (DNO). This may require special devices, for example to prevent reverse power. Refer also to
          Section 551, the DCode (Distribution Code of licensed distribution operators) and ENAEngineering Recommendations
          G98 (up to and including 16 A per phase) and G99 (greater than 16 A per phase).                                              |
NO T E 2: Precautions may be necessary to limit current circulation in the connection between the neutral points of the sources,
          in particular the effect of triplen harmonics.
NO T E 3: Guidance on the specification of wiring systems for safety services may be found in BS 8519.

560.6.10        Central power supply sources

The condition of the source for safety services (ready for operation, under fault conditions, feeding from the source
for safety services) shall be monitored.

560.7          CIRCUITS OF SAFETY SERVICES

560.7.1       Except where the recommendations of other safety standards apply, circuits of safety services shall
be independent of other circuits.
NOTE:      This means that any electrical fault or any intervention or modification in one system must not affect the correct
           functioning of the other. This may necessitate separation by fire-resistant materials or different routes or enclosures.

560.7.2          Circuits of safety services shall not pass through locations exposed to fire risk (BE2) unless they are
fire-resistant. The circuits shall not, in any case, pass through zones exposed to explosion risk (BE3).
NOTE:      Where practicable, the passage of circuits through locations presenting a fire risk should be avoided.

560.7.3        In accordance with Regulation 433.3.3, protection against overload may be omitted where the loss
of supply may cause a greater hazard. Where protection against overload is omitted, the occurrence of an overload
shall be monitored.


                                                                                                                                      227
      560.7.4         Overcurrent protective devices shall be selected and erected so as to avoid an overcurrent in one
      circuit impairing the correct operation of circuits of safety services.

      560.7.5         Switchgear and controlgear shall be clearly identified and grouped in locations accessible only to
      skilled or instructed persons (BA5 or BA4).

      560.7.6         In equipment supplied by two different circuits, a fault occurring in one circuit shall not impair the
      protection against electric shock or the correct operation of the other circuit. Such equipment shall be connected to
      the protective conductors of both circuits, if necessary.

      560.7.7        Safety circuit cables, other than metallic screened, fire-resistant cables, shall be adequately and
      reliably separated by distance or by barriers from other circuit cables, including other safety circuit cables.
      NOTE:      For battery cables, special requirements may apply.

      and wiring for lifts with special requirements, shall not be installed in lift wells or other flue-like openings.
      NOTE:     While fire-resistant cables will survive most fires, if they are located in an unstopped vertical well the upward air
                draught in a fire can generate excessive temperatures above the capabilities of the cable so they should be avoided as
                a route for safety systems.

      560.7.9       In addition to a general schematic diagram, full details of all electrical safety sources shall be given.

                           PERIODIC INSPECTION AND TESTING
651           GENERAL
651.1           Where required, periodic inspection and testing of every electrical installation shall be carried out
in accordance with Regulations 651.2 to 651.5 in order to determine, so far as is reasonably practicable, whether
the installation is in a satisfactory condition for continued service. Wherever possible, the documentation arising
from the initial certification and any previous periodic inspection and testing shall be taken into account. Where
no previous documentation is available, investigation of the electrical installation shall be undertaken prior to
carrying out the periodic inspection and testing.

651.2        Periodic inspection shall be carried out without dismantling, or with partial dismantling, as required,
supplemented by appropriate tests and measurements from Chapter 64, to provide for:
   (i) the safety of persons and livestock against the effects of electric shock and bums
  (ii) protection against damage to property by fire and heat arising from an electrical installation defect
 (iii) confirmation of correct rating and setting of protective devices required by Chapter 41
  (iv) confirmation of correct rating and setting of monitoring devices
  (v) confirmation that the installation is not damaged or deteriorated so as to impair safety
  (vi) the identification of installation defects and non-compliances with the requirements of the relevant parts of
       BS 7671, that may give rise to danger.
NOTE 1 : A generic list of examples of items requiring inspection is given in Appendix 6.
NOTE 2: Existing installations may have been designed and installed to conform to previous editions of BS 7671, applicable
        at the time of their design and erection. This does not necessarily mean that they are unsafe.

Where a circuit is permanently monitored by an RCM or an IMD it is not necessary to measure the insulation
resistance if the functioning of the RCM or IMD is correct.

The functioning of the RCM or IMD shall be verified.

651.3         Periodic inspection and testing shall not cause danger to persons or livestock and shall not cause
damage to property or equipment even if the circuit is defective.

Measuring instruments and monitoring equipment and methods shall be chosen in accordance with the relevant
parts of BS EN 61557. If other measuring equipment is used, it shall provide no less a degree of performance and
safety.

651.4           Details of any damage, deterioration, defects or dangerous conditions shall be recorded in a report.

651.5           The periodic inspection and testing shall be carried out by one or more skilled persons competent
in such work.

652           FREQUENCY OF PERIODIC INSPECTION AND TESTING
652.1           The frequency of periodic inspection and testing of an installation shall be determined having
regard to the type of installation and equipment, its use and operation, the frequency and quality of maintenance
and the external influences to which it may be subjected. The results and recommendations of previous certificates
and condition reports shall also be taken into account.

652.2         In the case of an installation under an effective management system for preventative maintenance in
normal use, periodic inspection and testing may be replaced by an adequate regime of continuous monitoring and
maintenance of the installation and all its constituent equipment by one or more skilled persons competent in such
work. Appropriate records shall be kept.

653           REPORTING FOR PERIODIC INSPECTION AND TESTING
653.1          Upon completion of the periodic inspection and testing of an existing installation, an Electrical
Installation Condition Report based on the model given in Appendix 6 shall be produced.

                                                     SECTION 701

                        LOCATIONS CONTAINING A BATH O R SHOWER
      701.1         Scope
      The particular requirements of this section apply to the electrical installations in locations containing a fixed bath
      (bath tub, birthing pool) or shower and to the surrounding zones as described in these regulations.

      This section does not apply to emergency facilities such as emergency showers used in industrial areas or
      laboratories.

      701.3         Assessment of general characteristics

      701.32        Classification of external influences

      701.32.1      General

      When applying this section, the zones specified in Regulations 701.32.2 to 4 shall be taken into account. For fixed
      prefabricated bath or shower units, the zones are applied to the situation when the bath or shower basin is in its
      usable configuration(s).

      Horizontal or inclined ceilings, walls with or without windows, doors, floors and fixed partitions may be taken into
      account where these effectively limit the extent of locations containing a bath or shower as well as their zones.
      Where the dimensions of fixed partitions are smaller than the dimensions of the relevant zones, e.g. partitions
      having a height lower than 2.25 m, the minimum distance in the horizontal and vertical directions shall be taken
      into account (see Figures 701.1 and 701.2).

      For electrical equipment in parts of walls or ceilings limiting the zones specified in Regulations 701.32.2 to
      701.32.4, but being part of the surface of that wall or ceiling, the requirements for the respective zone apply.

      701.32.2      Description of zone 0

      Zone 0 is the interior of the bath tub or shower basin (see Figures 701.1 and 701.2).

      For showers without a basin, the height of zone 0 is 0.10 m and its surface extent has the same horizontal extent
      as zone 1 (see Figure 701.2(f)).

      701.32.3      Description of zone 1

      Zone 1 is limited by:
         (i) the finished floor level and the horizontal plane corresponding to the highest fixed shower head or water
             outlet or the horizontal plane lying 2.25 m above the finished floor level, whichever is higher
        (ii) the vertical surface:
              (a) circumscribing the bath tub or shower basin (see Figure 701.1)
              (b) at a distance of 1.20 m from the centre point of the fixed water outlet on the wall or ceiling for showers
                  without a basin (see Figure 701.1(e) and (f)).

      Zone 1 does not include zone 0.

      The space under the bath tub or shower basin is considered to be zone 1. However, if the space under the bath tub
      or shower basin is only accessible with a tool, it is considered to be outside the zones.

      701.32.4      Description of zone 2

      Zone 2 is limited by:
         (i) the finished floor level and the horizontal plane corresponding to the highest fixed shower head or water
             outlet or the horizontal plane lying 2.25 m above the finished floor level, whichever is higher
        (ii) the vertical surface at the boundary of zone 1 and the parallel vertical surface at a distance of 0.60 m from
             the zone 1 border (see Figure 701.1).

      For showers without a basin, there is no zone 2 but an increased zone 1 is provided by the horizontal dimension of
      1.20 m mentioned in Regulation 701.32.3(ii)(b) (see Figure 701.1(e) and (f)).

                         SWIMMING POOLS AND OTHER BASINS
702.1         Scope, object and fundamental principles

702.11          Scope
The particular requirements of this section apply to the basins of swimming pools, the basins of fountains and the
basins of paddling pools. The particular requirements also apply to the surrounding zones of these basins.

In these areas, in normal use, the risk of electric shock is increased by a reduction in body resistance and contact of
the body with Earth potential. Swimming pools within the scope of an equipment standard are outside the scope of
these regulations.

Except for areas especially designated as swimming pools, the requirements of this section do not apply to natural
waters, lakes in gravel pits, coastal areas and the like.

702.3         Assessment of general characteristics

702.32          Classification of external influences
These requirements are based on the dimensions of three zones (examples are given in Figures 702.1 to 702.4).

Zones 1 and 2 may be limited by fixed partitions having a minimum height of 2.5 m.
   (i) Zone 0

This zone is the interior of the basin of the swimming pool or fountain including any recesses in its walls or floors,
basins for foot cleaning and waterjets or waterfalls and the space below them.
   (ii) Zone 1

      This zone is limited by:
            - zone 0
            - a vertical plane 2 m from the rim of the basin
            - the floor or surface expected to be occupied by persons
            - the horizontal plane 2.5 m above the floor or the surface expected to be occupied by persons.

Where the swimming pool or fountain contains diving boards, springboards, starting blocks, chutes or other
components expected to be occupied by persons, zone 1 comprises the zone limited by:
            - a vertical plane situated 1.5 m from the periphery of the diving boards, springboards, starting blocks,
              chutes and other components such as accessible sculptures, viewing bays and decorative basins
            - the horizontal plane 2.5 m above the highest surface expected to be occupied by persons.
   (iii) Zone 2

      This zone is limited by:
            - the vertical plane external to zone 1 and a parallel plane 1.5 m from the former
            - the floor or surface expected to be occupied by persons
            - the horizontal plane 2.5 m above the floor or surface expected to be occupied by persons.

There is no zone 2 for fountains.

702.4         Protection for safety

702.410.3       General requirements

702.410.3.4 Application of protective measures against electric shock

NOTE: Where a PME earthing facility is used as the means of earthing for the electrical installation of a swimming pool or
         other basin, it is recommended that an earth mat or earth electrode of suitably low resistance, e.g. 20 ohms or less, be
         installed and connected to the supplementary protective equipotential bonding.




                                                                                                                                    247
      702.410.3.4.1      Zones 0 and 1
      Except for fountains as stated in Regulation 702.410.3.4.2, in zone 0 only protection by SELV at a nominal voltage
      not exceeding 12 V AC rms or 30 V ripple-free DC is permitted, the source for SELV being installed outside zones
      0, 1 and 2.

      Except for fountains as stated in Regulation 702.410.3.4.2, in zone 1 only protection by SELV at a nominal voltage
      not exceeding 25 V AC rms or 60 V ripple-free DC is permitted, the source for SELV being installed outside
      zones 0, 1 and 2.

      Equipment for use in the interior of basins which is only intended to be in operation when people are not inside
      zone 0 shall be supplied by a circuit protected by:
         (i) SELV (Section 414), the source for SELV being installed outside zones 0, 1 and 2. However, it is permitted
             to install the source for SELV in zone 2 if its supply circuit is protected by an RCD having the characteristics
             specified in Regulation 415.1.1, or
        (ii) Automatic disconnection of supply (Section 411), using an RCD having the characteristics specified in
             Regulation 415.1.1, or
       (iii) Electrical separation (Section 413), the source for electrical separation supplying only one item of current
             using equipment and being installed outside zones 0, 1 and 2. However, it is permitted to install the source in
             zone 2 if its supply circuit is protected by an RCD having the characteristics specified in Regulation 415.1.1.

      The socket-outlet of a circuit supplying such equipment and the control device of such equipment shall have a notice
      in order to warn the user that this equipment shall be used only when the swimming pool is not occupied by persons.

                                                    MEDICAL LOCATIONS
      710.1          Scope

      The particular requirements of this section apply to patient healthcare facilities, such as, hospitals, private clinics,
      medical and dental practices, healthcare centres and dedicated medical rooms in the workplace to provide for the
      safety of patients and medical staff.
      In these areas the risk to patients is increased due to:
           - the reduction in body resistance, since the skin is often cut or broken, and
           - the threat from failure of the supply, especially to life supporting equipment.
      This section also applies to electrical installations in locations designed for medical research on patients.
      The requirements of this section do not apply to medical electrical (ME) equipment.
      N O T E 1 : The requirements of other sections of Part 7 may also apply.
      N O T E 2 : It may be necessary to modify the existing electrical installation, in accordance with BS 7671, when a change of
                utilization of the location occurs. Special care should be taken where intracardiac and/or life supporting procedures
                are performed in existing installations.
      N O T E 3 : Where applicable, the requirements of this section can also be used in veterinary clinics.
      N O T E 4 : For ME equipment and ME systems, refer to the BS EN 60601 series.
      N O T E 5 : Care should be taken so that other installations do not compromise the level of safety provided by installations meeting
                the requirements of this section.
      N O T E 6 : Supporting information about electrical services supply and distribution in healthcare premises, is given in Health
                Technical Memorandum (HTM) 06-01 'Electrical Services Supply and Distribution' and HTM 06-02 'Electrical Safety
                Guidance for Low Voltage Systems', published by the Department of Health. There are equivalent guidance documents
                in the other devolved administrations (Scotland (SHTM), Wales (WHTM) and Northern Ireland (HTM)).


      710.3          Assessment of general characteristics

      In order to determine the classification and Group number of a medical location, it is necessary that the relevant
      medical staff indicate which medical procedures will take place within the location. Based on the intended use, the
      appropriate classification for the location shall be determined.
      N O TE 1 : Classification of a medical location is related to the type of contact between applied parts and the patient, the threat
                to the safety of the patient owing to a discontinuity (failure) of the electrical supply, as well as the purpose for which
                the location is used. (Guidance on the allocation of a Group number and classification of safety services for medical
                locations is shown in Annex A710.)
      N O T E 2 : To provide protection of patients from possible electrical hazards, additional protective measures are applied in
                medical locations. The type and description of these hazards can vary according to the treatment being administered.
                The purpose for which a location is to be used may justify areas with different classifications (Group 0, 1 or 2) for
                different medical procedures.
      N O T E 3 : Applied parts are defined by the particular standards for ME equipment.
      N O T E 4 : Where a medical location may be used for different medical procedures the requirements           of the higher Group
                classification should be applied; refer to Annex A710.

      710.31          Purposes, supplies and structure

      710.312.2       Types of system earthing

      PEN conductors shall not be used in medical locations and medical buildings downstream of the main distribution
      board.
      NOTE:     Regulation 8(4) of the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations (ESQCR) prohibits the use of
                PEN conductors in consumers’ installations.

      710.313         Supplies

      710.313.1       Generafi

      In medical locations, the distribution system shall be designed and installed to facilitate the automatic changeover
      from the main distribution network to the electrical safety source feeding essential loads, as required by
      Regulation 560.5.

      Where other types of earth electrodes are used, separation distances should be increased, or the operating voltage
      decreased, accordingly, using the guidance in BS 7430.

      To protect a person touching the body of an electric vehicle, connected to the charging point, when an open-circuit fault
      occurs in the PEN conductor of the supply, an enhanced safety provision may be offered. This may be achieved by
      a device that provides shorter disconnection times, depending on the detected voltage between the circuit protective
      conductor and Earth but also taking into account the need to limit the risk of unwanted tripping. Examples of shorter
      disconnection times are shown in Table A722 below. These disconnection times are based on IEC Technical Report
      IEC TR 60479-5 and also on comparable requirements already included in Chapter 41 of BS 7671.

              PROSUMER’S LOW VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS
      821           SCOPE
      This chapter provides additional requirements, measures and recommendations for the design, erection and
      verification of all types of low voltage electrical installation according to Chapter 11, including local production
      and/or storage of energy in order to achieve compatibility with the existing and future ways to deliver electrical
      energy to current-using equipment or to the public network by means of local sources. Such electrical installations
      are designated as prosumer’s electrical installations (PEIs).

      This chapter provides requirements for PEIs to achieve safe operation, sustainability and efficient use of energy
      when integrated into smart grids.

      This chapter does not cover electrical sources for safety services including associated electrical installations and
      standby electrical supply systems for a secure continuity of supply, which are operated only occasionally and for
      short periods in parallel with the distribution grid for testing purposes.

      822           INTERACTION OF SMART GRID AND PEI

      822.1          Main objectives
      Smart grids and prosumers’ electrical installations interact with each other and a dynamic power demand/response
      concept should be implemented.

      The smart grid has an impact on prosumers’ electrical installations on the:
         (i) consideration of the prosumer’s needs, taking into account the constraint of the public network
        (ii) design and configuration of the installation to allow load shedding (according to BS IEC 60364-8-1) and
             source selection by the Electrical Energy Management System (EEMS).

      The user should be able to give different inputs to the EEMS, depending on the contract with the Distribution
      System Operator (DSO).

      Both the production of energy by renewable sources such as PV or wind turbines and the consumption patterns of
      loads within the installation are intermittent. Therefore, it is suggested that storage capacity is installed within the
      PEI if availability in island mode or stand-alone mode is needed, or to maximize the self-consumption in connected
      mode.

      822.2          Safety
      The implementation of the requirements provided shall not impair the safety of the PEI. In case of change of
      any energy supply configuration (e.g. from network supply to local power supplies) all protective measures shall
      continue to be operational or shall be automatically replaced by other protective measures providing an equivalent
      level of safety.

      822.3          Proper functioning
      It is essential for the operation of the smart grid that the electrical installation remains reliable and available for the
      maximum possible time while the power quality parameters are also maximized by using appropriate protection
      measures and other good installation practices.

      These requirements are important for the use of the island mode. It is essential for the PEI to comply with similar
      requirements on stability, availability and quality in island mode as for the connected mode.

      822.4          Implementation of PEI
      The PEI shall be designed, constructed and commissioned taking account of the constraints from the DNO/electricity
      supplier and the needs expressed by the end user.

      An EEMS shall be incorporated which combines information and/or data, from/to the DNO/electricity supplier, the
      availability of energy by the local sources and the user’s needs.

      824           TYPES OF PEI

      824.1         General
      There are different types of PEI:
         (i) individual (see Regulation 824.3)
        (ii) collective (see Regulation 824.4)
        (iii) shared (see Regulation 824.5).

      Each type of PEI can be arranged in the different operating modes defined in Regulation 824.2.

      824.2         Operating modes
      The main operating modes may be adopted for each type of PEI (individual, collective or shared). They are:
         (i) direct feeding mode (see Annex B82.1.1, B82.2.1, B82.3.1)
        (ii) reverse feeding mode (see Annex B82.1.3, B82.2.3, B82.3.3)
        (iii) island mode (see Annex B82.1.2, B82.2.2, B82.3.2).

      Storage units can supply current-using equipment or be charged by local power supplies or by the public network,
      except in island mode.

      Local power supplies can supply current-using equipment or local storage units or the public network, except in
      island mode.

      Transfer from/to the direct feeding mode to island mode and vice versa can be achieved by operating the switching
      device for islanding. This can be either directly controlled (manually or remotely) or automatically controlled.

      Switching from one mode to another can be done if the generators and/or converters are synchronized with the
      network (provided that the requirements of Section 551 are met).

      See Annex B82 for examples of operating modes.

      Selection of the possible operating modes may depend on the contract with the DNO.

      Technical requirements for the design of the PEI according to the selected operating mode are provided in Section 826.

      824.3         Individual PEI
      An individual PEI is characterized by one electrical installation having the capability to both consume and produce
      electrical energy, and having a management system for its operation.

      An example of individual PEI is provided in Figure 82.2.

354
      Where connection between all involved prosumers is using a distribution system within the PEI, then the aggregation
      of all prosumers installations corresponds to one single PEI seen by the DNO (see Figure 82.4).

Where the connection between all involved consumers uses the public distribution network in combination with a
distribution system within the PEI, the origin of the PEI for each consumer corresponds to the incoming service of
each individual prosumer (see Figure 82.5).

For the collective PEI, each electrical installation is considered as a consumer installation, while a common source
of local production is considered as a producer installation. Consumer and producer installations shall be considered
as separate.

                                                                                                                        357
824.5         Shared PED
The different power supplies may supply all the involved prosumers through a distribution system within the PEI or
through the DNO distribution system, if agreed by the DNO.

Individual premises, such as a residential estate or business park may group their interests in accepting to share
their supply with their neighbours from their own local production. Each building owner may have installed private
renewable energy power sources which can either supply the private electrical installation or supply the group
of private electrical installations. Such a system is named shared PEI. Examples of shared PEI are provided in
Figure 82.6 and in Figure 82.7.

For the shared PEI, each electrical installation can either produce or consume electrical energy. Therefore, each of
them shall be considered as a prosumer. The electricity produced by the power supply of one prosumer may be used
locally by this prosumer or may be used by other prosumers of the group.

The different power supplies may supply all involved prosumers through a distribution system within the PEI or
through the DNO distribution system, if agreed by the DNO.

825            ELECTRICAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EEMS)

825.1           General
An EEMS shall monitor and control the operation of all power supplies, the load of the storage units and the
operation of loads.

The concept and the design architecture of the PEI mainly depends on the concept of electrical energy management
system (see BS IEC 60364-8-1). The objectives of the EEMS are to:
   (i)    control the connection of the PEI to the smart grid
  (ii)    manage locally the electrical energy production
  (iii)   manage locally the electrical energy consumption
  (iv)    manage the electrical energy procurement from the DSO.

The following are examples of functions that may be handled by the EEMS:
  (v)     power sources and loads management
  (vi)    multi source connection management
 (vii)    propose load control (load shedding and load shifting)
(viii)    bidirectional exchange of information with the DSO
  (ix)    backup system management by means of electrical energy storage units and power sources
  (x)     control the electrical energy flow from and to electrical energy storage units
  (xi)    monitor the voltage quality
 (xii)    provide an interface for the end user.

The EEMS may be installed as a separate item of equipment or be integrated within other equipment. Annex D82
shows examples of implementation of an EEMS.

825.2           Architecture of EEMS
In an individual, collective or shared PEI, one or several EEMSs shall monitor and control the operation of loads,
all power supplies and storage units.

For collective or shared PEI, this EEMS can be either a central system or the association of the different EEMSs
sharing together all the relevant information.

Consumption of each electrical installation forming part of the individual, collective or shared PEI shall be
monitored, as well as all local electricity production.

To do so, energy meters, performance measuring and monitoring devices (PMD) or other measuring equipment shall
be installed in appropriate/required locations.

See Annex D82.

826            TECHNICAL ISSUES

826.1           Safety issues

826.1.1         Protection against electric shock

826.1.1.1       General
The PEI shall be able to operate in any intended operating mode as defined in Regulation 824.2. According to needs,
a PEI can change the operating mode at any time and may come back to the initial operating mode also at any time
(for instance, from direct feeding mode to island mode and then back to direct feeding mode).

Protection of persons and properties shall be provided in all operating modes.



                                                                                                                       361
      This is particularly the case for the protection of persons against electric shock when the automatic disconnection
      of supply is used as a protective measure for all intended operating modes. In this case, the system earthing used for
      all intended operating modes may differ and may depend on the operating mode.
         (i) In connected mode, without galvanic separation, the PEI remains connected to the public distribution
             network. Therefore, the system earthing of the PEI shall be the same as that of the public distribution
             network.
        (ii) In island mode, the PEI is disconnected from the public distribution network. Therefore, the system earthing
             of the PEI may differ from the one used within the public distribution network.

      In island mode, where ADS is the protective measure, the PEI shall meet the requirements of Regulation 551.4.3.2.1.

      A switching device suitable for isolation according to Chapter 53 shall disconnect all live conductors from the public
      distribution network.

      826.1.1.2     System earthing

      826.1.1.2.1 Earthing arrangement
      The earthing arrangement needed for operating the PEI in island mode shall be connected to a suitable earth electrode
      complying with Regulation 542.2.2. Any connection to the means of earthing derived from the public distribution
      network need not be disconnected.

      Any change of type of system earthing for island mode shall be reversible as operation in this mode can be temporary,
      and the PEI can then be operated again in connected mode.

      When the installation is connected to different sources in parallel, simultaneously accessible exposed-conductive-
      parts and/or extraneous-conductive-parts shall be connected to the same earthing arrangement individually, in
      groups or collectively.
      NOTE:    Two parts are deemed to be simultaneously accessible if they are not more than 2.50 m apart (see Figure 417).

      826.1.1.2.2 Neutral conductor
      When in island mode, all live conductors shall be disconnected from the DNO supply.

      To prevent incorrect operation of RCDs the use of a neutral switch device shall connect the neutral and the earth of
      the PEI without overlapping with switching of the DNO neutral.

      826.1.1.2.3 Connection to the local earthing arrangement
      A transfer switching device meeting the requirements of Regulation 537.1.5 shall be inserted in the conductor used
      for the connection to the earthing arrangement of the local star/mid-point or the local exposed-conductive-parts.

      826.1.1.3     Selection of protective device
      Operation of the protective device shall be in accordance with the maximum disconnection times as required by
      Chapter 41 and the requirements of Regulation 55 1.2.

      The selection of protective devices against electric shock shall consider the minimum earth fault current value
      (between one of the line conductors and PE conductor). The minimum earth fault cunent value may depend on the
      operating mode (see Figure 82.9).




362
        Fig 82.9 - Estimation of the minimum earth fault current according to the operating mode
                                             (connected and island)

               4        Storage units
               9        Overcurrent protection device (OCPD)


   (i) In TN and IT systems, an overcurrent protective device (OCPD) may be used as a protective device giving
       automatic disconnection in the event of a fault. The system earthing may change depending on the operating
       mode, the selection of the overcurrent device shall consider each operating mode.
  (ii) In connected mode, the fault current is supplied by the public network, the local power supply and by the
       local storage units. The main contribution will certainly come from the public network.
  (iii) In island mode, the earth fault current is only supplied by the local power supplies and by the local storage
        units. The local power supplies may be current sources (e.g. solar photovoltaic cells) with a very low earth
        fault current value. The local energy storage units may have their contribution to the earth-fault current
        value limited by the rectifiers used for their connection to an AC installation.

Therefore, in TN and IT systems, overcurrent protective devices used for fault protection shall be selected for each
source, considering the minimum contribution of each one (island mode).
NOTE:     It could be reached e.g. using a double setting on the same device, two devices coordinated or taking into account the
          minimum setting of the worst condition.

In a TT system, as the earth fault current is limited by the earth electrode resistance, there is no practical interaction
of the operating mode as far as the level of fault current is concerned. See Regulation 411.5.

826.1.1.4      Isolation of the installation
Where an installation is supplied from more than one source, a main switch suitable for isolation (e.g. switch
disconnector) shall be provided for each source of supply. A durable warning notice shall be permanently fixed in the
vicinity of these main switches in such a position that any person seeking to operate any of these main switches will
be warned of the need to operate all such switches to achieve isolation of the installation. Alternatively, a suitable
interlock system shall be provided. See Section 462 and Regulation 537.1.2.

826.1.1.5      Switching device for island mode
Switching devices for island mode, introduced in Regulation 824.2, shall comply with Regulation 512.1.2 and their
relevant product standard, and be suitable for isolation.


                                                                                                                                   363
      826.1.2         Protection against overcurrent

      826.1.2.1       Magnitude of overcurrent
      Overload and short-circuit currents shall be determined at every point of the PEI where a protective device is
      installed:
         (i) for all possible configurations of each type of PEI, and
         (ii) for situations corresponding to the minimum and maximum current magnitudes.

      In all cases, compliance with Chapter 43 shall be fulfilled.
      NOTE1 : The operating mode influences greatly the overcurrent magnitude. In particular, in island mode, the short-circuit
              current will have a different magnitude from the direct feeding mode and reverse feeding mode.
      NOTE 2: The solar photovoltaic cells are considered to be current mode power sources with a very low short-circuit current.
              In the case where batteries are connected in parallel with the solar photovoltaic cells, the short-circuit current will be
              higher.

      The selection of overcurrent protective devices shall consider:
        (iii)   the maximum short-circuit current (e.g. connected mode) for the selection of breaking capacity, and
        (iv)    the minimum short-circuit current (e.g. island mode) for the setting of the tripping characteristics of the
                short-circuit protective device.

      826.1.2.2       Location of overcurrent protective devices
      Selection and erection of overcurrent protective devices shall take account of all possible directions of current flow
      and polarity.

      Connection of a source of supply via switchgear or controlgear assemblies shall comply with Regulation 551.7.2.

      Overload and short-circuit protection shall be placed at the origin of the circuit. Exceptions are permitted
      (see Regulations 433.2 and 433.3).

      The origin of the circuit may differ depending on the arrangements used for the PEI. Where the PEI is supplied from
      the public network the origin of the circuit is located at one end of the circuit. Where the PEI is supplied from local
      power supplies (including local storage units) the origins may be at the other physical locations on the circuit.

      In this case a short-circuit protective device is installed at each possible origin of the relevant distribution circuit,
      each short-circuit protective device shall be selected and, where applicable, adjusted for each type of power supply
      (see Figure 82.10). To reduce multiple short-circuit protective devices on the same circuit, it is recommended to
      connect local power supplies and local storage units directly to the main distribution board.

                         9-2      Overcurrent protection device (OCPD 2)


826.1.2.3      Combined short-circuit protection
Where combined short-circuit protection is used in the electrical installation in accordance with Regulation 434.5.1,
coordination between two or more short-circuit protective devices shall consider all possible configurations of
power supplies. This requires that the installation designer considers all possible short-circuit currents through all
short-circuit protective devices and to verify if coordination between two or more short-circuit protective devices
is achieved.
NOTE:     In some configurations, the short-circuit current through coordinated protective devices may differ depending on the
          connected power supplies.

As a consequence of the above, the designer, when considering combined short-circuit protection, shall take account
of all possible fault current magnitudes depending on:
   (i) location of fault
  (ii)   various possible combinations of power supplies connected to the PEI and
 (iii) various operating modes.

826.1.3        Outage of the public network

When the public network is not energized, prosumers shall operate their private individual PEI in island mode or
automatically disconnect all local power supplies.

As control devices and protective devices may be operated more frequently than in non PEI, selection of components
is recommended to be made according to the increased duty requirements (in terms of electrical and mechanical
operations).

                                                                                                                                 365
826.1.4       Protection against transient overvoltages

Switching overvoltages in a PEI may be more frequent and perhaps greater than in a non PEI installation (e.g. due
to the switching between sources, load shedding, load shifting). Consideration is to be given to the installation of
surge protective devices for the protection of the PEI installation and equipment against switching overvoltages.

826.2         Interaction with the public network
The PEI shall comply with all the supply requirements (e.g. voltage, frequency). See also Annex C82.

826.3         Energy storage
Consideration shall be given to the inrush current and other capabilities of local energy storage in the design of the
system, especially when switching between operating modes.

826.4         Design for flexibility of load and generators (demand/response)
Where applicable the electrical installation shall be designed for the operability of load shedding.
See BS HD 60364-8-1.

826.5         Electric vehicle charging
An electric vehicle (EV) capable of operating as a prosumer represents a particular case of a load and local storage
unit. Such a vehicle will not be permanently connected to the PEI.
Electric vehicle charging equipment (see Section 722) for a vehicle operating as a prosumer should be managed by
the EEMS as defined in Regulation 825.1.

826.6         Selectivity between protective devices
Selectivity between protective devices consists of the coordination between two or more protective devices such
that on the incidence of an overcurrent or a fault current only the protective device on the load side (downstream)
operates while the other protective device or devices do not. See Section 536.
Therefore, when considering selectivity issues, it is important to know where the power supply is connected to the
installation (see Figure 82.11).
As a consequence, selectivity shall be considered according to all possible fault currents depending on:
   (i) location of fault
   (ii) various possible combination of power supplies connected to the PEI and
  (iii) various operating modes.
Selectivity can concern the following types of protective device:
  (iv) overload protective device
   (v) short-circuit protective device
  (vi) residual current device.
                     Fig 82.11 - Example of selectivity with various power supplies




                                                                       2

          9-3      Overcurrent protection device (OCPD 3)
          9-4      Overcurrent protection device (OCPD 4)

          In this example, selectivity is usually proposed between OCPD 1 and OCPD 2 in the case
          of normal supply from the DSO transformer. OCPD 3 and OCPD 4 are considered at the same
          level of selectivity as OCPD 1. In island mode, for instance, power supply can be local.
          In this case, selectivity needs to be considered between OCPD 2 and OCPD 3 and/or OCPD 4.


826.7           Testing and verification
The validity of test readings taken with a fault loop impedance test instrument may be adversely affected by
power converting equipment (such as inverters) within the prosumer’s installation. In such cases an alternative
method of determining prospective fault current and earth fault loop impedance shall be used. See Note 1 of
Regulation 643.7.3.1.

                                                     (Informative)
                                 OBJECTIVES AND CONCEPT OF PEI

      The concept of PEI has been developed to provide an appropriate answer to the following issues.

         (i) The role of the end user: to control the usage of electrical energy taking into account their needs and the
             effects on the DNO’s supply. The PEI concept keeps the role of the end user as central. Where the PEI has
             a storage capability, the end user can take advantage of low demand to store the energy when its price may
             be lower.
        (ii) Active energy management: the end user should be able to permanently monitor and control their own
             electricity consumption and their own electricity production as a result of an active energy management
             system. These systems are intended to balance the local consumption with the local production and the
             supply from/to the DNO. The active energy management system should also communicate with the DSO
             for exchanging or receiving of information for controlling purposes, for example receiving signals from the
             DSO when urgent electricity consumption reduction is needed.
       (iii) Renewable sources: deployment of renewable energy at the DSO side and/or at the end user side is of
             prime importance for the reduction of CO2 emissions. In addition, local renewable power supplies such
             as photovoltaic systems and wind turbines can play an important role by supplying local current-using
             equipment when necessary (during daily peak electricity consumption).
       (iv)   Storage: electrical energy may be stored locally (e.g. batteries) to be used when required. Storage may also
              be used to reduce reliance on the traditional utility supply. Storage may also be used to hold a reserve of
              excess energy generated by renewable sources that may not function when their ability to function becomes
              impaired (e.g. solar at night, wind turbines in calm weather).

B82.1.2        Island mode
In this mode, the PEI is disconnected from the public network. See Figure B82.2.

Current-using equipment inside the PEI is supplied either from the local power supplies and/or from local energy
storage unit(s), if any.

Local energy storage units are charged from the local power supply, or supplying the local current-using equipment.

Load shedding may be recommended if this operating mode is considered to be economic, and consequently should
remain in place for as long as is necessary. In this case charging the storage units should be avoided.

      Similarly to the individual PEI, all electrical installations should be disconnected from the public network when
      electrical energy is not supplied by the DNO.

      Electricity consumed by connected current-using equipment of all private electrical installations is produced by the

      Any measure against the occurrence of voltage disturbances or interruptions should be considered when designing
      the installation working in island mode.

      B82.2.3       Reverse feeding mode
      In this operating mode only one prosumer is supplying electrical energy to the public network. See Figure B82.8
      and Figure B82.9.

      The electrical energy produced locally is:
         (i) used by the group of end users through a local installation connecting all local prosumers or for charging the

Any measure against the occurrence of voltage disturbances or interruptions should be considered when designing
the installation working in island mode.

B82.3.3       Reverse feeding mode
In this operating mode, part of or the entire electrical energy produced locally by all local power supplies or from
local storage units may be supplied to the public network.
All current-using equipment in operation should also be supplied by all local power supplies and/or local storage
unit(s).

                          INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC NETWORK
      C82.1         General
      Usually the nominal power of each PEI is sufficiently low compared to the nominal power of the low voltage public
      power network and even lower when compared to the HV public network, so that there is no noticeable influence
      of the PEI on the stability of public networks. However, high numbers of PEIs connected to the same public
      network could cause instability of these public networks resulting in the disconnection of some lines (distribution
      or transmission). PEIs should be designed in such a way that their dynamical influence on the stability of public
      networks is reduced or, even better, that they improve the dynamic stability of these public networks.

      C82.2        National grid codes compliance with active and reactive power control
      Local energy supplies used in the PEI are controlled by electronic devices such as inverters. Consequently, it is
      possible to monitor and control the active power and the reactive power injected into the public network from the
      PEI. These electronic devices may adjust the magnitude and the phase angle of the output voltage allowing the
      control of the active and reactive power consumed by or injected to the public network.
      NOTE:    In the UK these requirements are covered by the Distribution Code (www.dcode.org.uk).

      C82.3        Voltage control
      Correct voltage regulation avoids circulation of reactive current between power supplies. In some architectures,
      electrical power sources of several prosumers may not be far from each other. Line inductance between each source
      is not high enough to limit currents circulating between prosumers’ sources.
      NOTE: In the UK these requirements are covered by the Distribution Code (www.dcode.org.uk).

      C82.4        Frequency control

      Frequency control for each local power supply should be installed in order to adapt the frequency to the nominal
      value when disconnecting from the public network for operating in island mode.

      This frequency control should also consider the case where several local power supplies operate in parallel.
      NOTE: In the UK these requirements are covered by the Distribution Code (www.dcode.org.uk).

      C82.5        Load shedding strategy
      The electrical energy management system (EEMS) of a PEI should control the local loads and the local generation
      of energy. In response to the public network needs through, for instance, communication facilities, the local PEI may
      shed some local loads. In accordance with the contract agreed between the DSO and the prosumer, the EEMS of the
      PEI may adapt the consumption of energy from the public network and/or the generation of local energy according
      to the request from the DSO.
      NOTE: In the UK these requirements are covered by the Distribution Code (www.dcode.org.uk).

Regulation 28 of the ESQCR 2002 (or ESQCR(NI)2012) requires distributors to provide the following information
to relevant persons free of charge:
     The maximum prospective short-circuit current at the supply terminals
     The maximum earth loop impedance of the earth fault path outside the installation (Ze)
     The type and rating of the distributor’s protective device or devices nearest to the supply terminals
     The type of earthing system applicable to the connection
     The number of phases of the supply
     The frequency of the supply and the extent of the permitted variations
     The voltage of the supply and the extent of the permitted variations.

3. Where it is intended to use protective multiple earthing the distributor and the consumer must comply with the
ESQCR 2002 (or ESQCR(NI)2012).

4. For further guidance on the application of the Electricity at Work Regulations (including the Northern Ireland
version), reference may be made to the following publication:
   (i) Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 Guidance on Regulations (HSR25).

5. For installations in potentially explosive atmospheres reference should be made to:
   (i) the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989
  (ii) the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) 2002
  (iii) the Petroleum (Consolidation) Regulations 2014
  (iv) the Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres
       Regulations 2016
  (v) relevant British or Harmonized Standards.

Under the Petroleum (Consolidation) Regulations 2014 Petroleum Enforcing Authorities are empowered to grant
licences in respect of premises where petroleum spirit is stored and the authorities may attach such conditions as
they think fit, the requirements may vary from one local authority to another. Guidance may be obtained from the
Energy Institute (APEA/IP) publication Design, Construction, Modification, Maintenance and Decommissioning of
Filling Stations.

6. For installations on caravan parks, the requirements of the licensing authority should be ascertained. Model
Standards were issued by the Department of the Environment in 1977 under the Caravan Sites and Control of
Development Act 1960, as amended, as guidance for local authorities.

7. For installations in theatres and other places of entertainment, the requirements of the licensing authority should
be ascertained.

8. The Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 2016, administered by the Department for Business, Energy
& Industrial Strategy (BEIS), contain requirements for safety of equipment designed or suitable for general use.
Information on the application of the Regulations is given in guidance issued by BEIS.

9. The Plugs and Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 made under the Consumer Safety Act 1978, administered
by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, contains requirements for the safety of plugs,
sockets, adaptors and fuse links etc. designed for use at a voltage of not less than 200 volts.

10. The Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996 require employers to provide safety signs.
Guidance from the Health and Safety Executive L64, Safety Signs and Signals, specifies signs including emergency
escape, first aid and fire safety signs.

11. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 require employers and self-employed persons
to assess risks to workers and others who may be affected by their work or business. This is intended to enable them
to identify measures they need to take to comply with the law. Guidance from the Health and Safety Executive
INDG163 gives advice on these regulations. For the purposes of BS 7671, a risk assessment should involve an
appropriate electrically skilled person.

12. The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 require employers to ensure that all work equipment
is suitable for the purpose for which it is used, is properly maintained and that appropriate training is given. The
Health and Safety Executive has published an Approved Code of Practice L22, Safe use of work equipment, which
gives advice that has special legal status.

13. The Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2016 provide requirements for electrical and electronic products
for electromagnetic compatibility.


                                                                                                                         407
      14. Other Regulations, as amended, relevant to electrical installation include:

      The Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 2002 (HSE Publication L25)

      The Personal Protective Equipment (Enforcement) Regulations 2018

      The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 (HSE Publication L24)

      The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 (HSE Publication L23)

      The Work at Height Regulations 2005

      The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (HSE Publication L153).

      15. In November 1988 the European electrical standards body CENELEC agreed on harmonization of low voltage
      electricity supplies within Europe (CENELEC document HD 472 SI), implemented by BS 7697 Nominal voltages
      for low voltage public electricity supply systems. The measure is intended to harmonize mains electricity supplies at
      230 V within Europe. CENELEC proposed three stages of harmonization. Two stages of harmonization have taken
      place, these being shown below.

           Effective date            Nominal voltage               Permitted tolerance          Permitted voltage range
             Pre-1995                     240 V                        +6 % / -6 %                  2 25.6 -25 4.4 V
          1 January 1995                  230 V                       +10 % / -6 %                  216.2 - 2 5 3 . 0 V

      16. Distribution Code [of licensed Distribution Operators of Great Britain]

      The Electricity Act 1989 (as amended by the Utilities Act 2000 and the Energy Act 2004) requires the DNOs under
      the terms of their licences to produce and comply with the Distribution Code.

      The Distribution Code has to be complied with by the DNO and by potential and existing Generators, Suppliers and
      Customers connected to or seeking connection to the DNO’s distribution system.

      17. The Construction Products Regulation, administered by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and
      Communities, lays down requirements relating to obligations of manufacturers in respect of testing, certifying
      and placing upon the market, products intended for permanent installation in buildings and construction works.
      The electrical products covered are ‘Power, control and communication cables’ in respect of their reaction to
      fire performance. The Regulations empower the UK to determine levels of performance required for particular
      installations. In the UK, DLUHC has not exercised these powers in respect of reaction to fire for cables. Guidance
      may be given elsewhere, including in European and British Standards. For example, guidance for telecommunication
      cabling is in BS 6701 Telecommunications equipment and telecommunications cabling - Specification for installation,
      operation and maintenance.

      The generic reaction to fire requirements for all cables are given in BS EN 50575 Power, control and communication
      cables - Cables for general applications in construction works subject to reaction to fire requirements. (All other
      requirements - electrical, mechanical, constructional, transmission - remain in existing product standards.)

         CURRENT-CARRYING CAPACITY AND VOLTAGE DROP FOR

                                                      CABLES
1               INTRODUCTION

The recommendations of this appendix are intended to provide for a satisfactory life of conductors and insulation
subjected to the thermal effects of carrying current for prolonged periods of time in normal service. Other
considerations affect the choice of cross-sectional area of conductors, such as the requirements for protection
against electric shock (Chapter 41), protection against thermal effects (Chapter 42), overcurrent protection
(Chapter 43), voltage drop (Section 525), and limiting temperatures for terminals of equipment to which the
conductors are connected (Section 526).

This appendix applies to non-sheathed and sheathed cables having a nominal voltage rating not exceeding 1 kV AC or
1.5kVDC.

The values in Tables 4D1A to 4J4A have been derived in accordance with the methods given in BS 7769
(BS IEC 60287) using such dimensions as specified in the international standard IEC 60502-1 and conductor
resistances given in BS EN 60228. Known practical variations in cable construction (e.g. form of conductor) and
manufacturing tolerances result in a spread of possible dimensions and hence current-carrying capacities for each
conductor size. Tabulated current-carrying capacities have been selected in such a way as to take account of this
spread of values with safety and to lie on a smooth curve when plotted against conductor cross-sectional area.

For multicore cables having conductors with a cross-sectional area of 25 mm2 or larger, either circular or shaped
conductors are permissible. Tabulated values have been derived from dimensions appropriate to shaped conductors.

All the current-carrying capacities given are based on the ambient temperature and conductor/sheath operating
temperature stated in Tables 4D1A to 4F2A and 4G1A to 4J4A.

2               CIRCUIT PARAMETERS

2.1             Ambient Temperature

The current-carrying capacities in this appendix are based upon the following reference ambient temperatures:
    (i) For non-sheathed and sheathed cables in air, irrespective of the Installation Method: 30 °C
    (ii) For buried cables, either directly in the soil or in ducts in the ground: 20 °C.

Where the ambient temperature in the intended location of the non-sheathed or sheathed cables differs from the
reference ambient temperature, the appropriate rating factors given in Tables 4B1 and 4B2 are to be applied to the
values of current-carrying capacity set out in Tables 4D1A to 4J4A. For buried cables, further correction is not
needed if the soil temperature exceeds the selected ambient temperature by an amount up to 5 °C for only a few
weeks a year.

The rating factors in Tables 4B1 and 4B2 do not take account of the increase, if any, due to solar or other infrared
radiation. Where non-sheathed or sheathed cables are subject to such radiation, the current-carrying capacity may be
derived by the methods specified in BS 7769 (BS IEC 60287).

2.2             Soil Thermal Resistivity

The current-carrying capacities tabulated in this appendix for cables in the ground are based upon a soil thermal
resistivity of 2.5 K.m/W and are intended to be applied to cables laid in and around buildings. For other
installations, where investigations establish more accurate values of soil thermal resistivity appropriate for the
load to be carried, the values of current-carrying capacity may be derived by the methods of calculation given in
BS 7769 (BS IEC 60287) or obtained from the cable manufacturer.

In locations where the effective soil thermal resistivity is higher than 2.5 K.m/W, an appropriate reduction in
current-carrying capacity should be made or the soil immediately around the cables should be replaced by a more
suitable material. Such cases can usually be recognized by very dry ground conditions. Rating factors for soil
thermal resistivities other than 2.5 K.m/W are given in Table 4B3.




                                                                                                                       421
      2.3              Groups of cables containing more than one circuit

      2.3.1            Methods of Installation A to D in Table 4A2
      Current-carrying capacities given in Tables 4D1A to 4J4A apply to single circuits consisting of:
            (i) two non-sheathed cables or two single-core cables, or one two-core cable
           (ii) three non-sheathed cables or three single-core cables, or one three-core cable.

      Where more non-sheathed cables, other than bare mineral insulated cables not exposed to touch, are installed in the
      same group, the group rating factors specified in Tables 4C1 to 4C3 need to be applied.
      NOTE:       The group rating factors have been calculated on the basis of prolonged steady-state operation at a 100 % load factor for
                  all live conductors. Where the loading is less than 100 % as a result of the conditions of operation of the installation,
                  the group rating factors may be higher.

      2.3.2            Methods of Installation E and F in Table 4A2
      The current-carrying capacities of Tables 4D1A to 4J4A apply to these Reference Methods.

      For installations on perforated trays, cleats and similar, current-carrying capacities for both single circuits and
      groups are obtained by multiplying the capacities given for the relevant arrangements of non-sheathed or sheathed
      cables in free air, as indicated in Tables 4D1A to 4J4A, by the applicable group rating factors given in Tables 4C4
      and 4C5. No group rating factors are required for bare mineral insulated cables not exposed to touch, Tables 4G1A
      and 4G2A refer.
      NOTE 1 : Group rating factors have been calculated as averages for the range of conductor sizes, cable types and installation
               condition considered. Attention is drawn to the notes under each table. In some instances, a more precise calculation
               may be required.
      NOTE 2 : Group rating factors have been calculated on the basis that the group consists of similar, equally loaded non-sheathed
               or sheathed cables. Where a group contains various sizes of non-sheathed or sheathed cables, caution should be
               exercised over the current loading of the smaller cables (see 2.3.3 below).
      NOTE 3: A group of similar cables is taken to be a group where the current-carrying capacity of all the cables is based on the
              same maximum permissible conductor temperature and where the range of conductor sizes in the group spans not
              more than three adjacent standard sizes.

      2.3.3            Groups of cables containing different sizes
      Tabulated group rating factors are applicable to groups consisting of similar equally loaded cables. The calculation
      of rating factors for groups containing different sizes of equally loaded sheathed or non-sheathed cables is
      dependent on the total number in the group and the mix of sizes. Such factors cannot be tabulated but must be
      calculated for each group. The method of calculation of such factors is outside the scope of this appendix. Two
      specific examples of where such calculations may be advisable are given below.

      2.3.3.1          Groups in conduit systems, cable trunking systems or cable ducting systems
      For a group containing different sizes of non-sheathed or sheathed cables in conduit systems, cable trunking
      systems or cable ducting systems, a simple formula for calculation of the group rating factor is:




      where
       Cg          is the group rating factor
       n           is the number of circuits in the group.


      The group rating factor obtained by this equation will reduce the danger of overloading the smaller sizes but
      may lead to under-utilization of the larger sizes. Such under-utilization can be avoided if large and small sizes of
      non-sheathed or sheathed cable are not mixed in the same group.

      The use of a method of calculation specifically intended for groups containing different sizes of non-sheathed or
      sheathed cable in conduit will produce a more precise group rating factor.

      2.3.3.2          Groups of cables on trays
      Where a group contains different sizes of non-sheathed or sheathed cable, caution must be exercised over the
      current loading of the smaller sizes. It is preferable to use a method of calculation specifically intended for groups
      containing different sizes of non-sheathed or sheathed cables.

Reference Method A, for example, Installation Methods 1 and 2 of Table 4A2 (non-sheathed cables and
multicore cables in conduit in a thermally insulated wall).

The wall consists of an outer weatherproof skin, thermal insulation and an inner skin of wood or wood-like
material having a thermal conductance of at least 10 W/m2K. The conduit is fixed such that it is close to, but not
necessarily touching, the inner skin. Heat from the cables is assumed to escape through the inner skin only. The
conduit can be metal or plastic.

Reference Method B, for example, Installation Method 4 of Table 4A2 (non-sheathed cables in conduit mounted
on a wooden or masonry wall) and Installation Method 5 of Table 4A2 (multicore cable in conduit on a wooden or
masonry wall).

The conduit is mounted on a wooden wall such that the gap between the conduit and the surface is less than
0.3 times the conduit diameter. The conduit can be metal or plastic. Where the conduit is fixed to a masonry wall the
current-carrying capacity of the non-sheathed or sheathed cable may be higher.

Reference Method C (clipped direct), for example, Installation Method 20 of Table 4A2 (single-core or
multicore cables on a wooden or masonry wall).

Cable mounted on a wooden wall so that the gap between the cable and the surface is less than 0.3 times the cable
diameter. Where the cable is fixed to or embedded in a masonry wall the current-carrying capacity may be higher.
NOTE 2: The term 'masonry' is taken to include brickwork, concrete, plaster and similar (but excluding thermally insulating
          materials).

Reference Method D, for example, Installation Method 70 of Table 4A2 (multicore armoured cable in conduit or
in cable ducting in the ground).

The cable is drawn into a 100 mm diameter plastic, earthenware or metallic duct laid in direct contact with soil
having a thermal resistivity of 2.5 K.m/W and at a depth of 0.7 m. The values given for this method are those stated
in this appendix and are based on conservative installation parameters. If the specific installation parameters are
known (thermal resistance of the ground, ground ambient temperature, cable depth), reference can be made to the
cable manufacturer or the ERA 69-30 series of publications, which may result in a smaller cable size being selected.
NOTE 3: The current-carrying capacity for cables laid in direct contact with soil having a thermal resistivity of 2.5 Km/W and
          at a depth of 0.7 m is approximately 10 % higher than the values tabulated for Reference Method D.

Reference Methods E, F and G, for example, Installation Methods 31 to 35 of Table 4A (single-core or
multicore cables in free air).

The cable is supported such that the total heat dissipation is not impeded. Heating due to solar radiation and other
sources is to be taken into account. Care is to be taken that natural air convection is not impeded. In practice, a
clearance between a cable and any adjacent surface of at least 0.3 times the cable external diameter for multicore
cables or 1.0 times the cable diameter for single-core cables is sufficient to permit the use of current-carrying
capacities appropriate to free air conditions.

7.2            Other Methods

Cable on a floor: Reference Method C applies for current rating purposes.

Cable under a ceiling: This installation may appear similar to Reference Method C but because of the reduction
in natural air convection, Reference Method B is to be used for the current rating.

Cable tray systems: A perforated cable tray has a regular pattern of holes that occupy at least 30 % of the area of
the base of the tray. The current-carrying capacity for cables attached to perforated cable trays should be taken as
Reference Method E or F. The current-carrying capacity for cables attached to unperforated cable trays (no holes or
holes that occupy less than 30 % of the area of the base of the tray) is to be taken as Reference Method C.

Cable ladder system: This is a construction which offers a minimum of impedance to the air flow around the
cables, i.e. supporting metalwork under the cables occupies less than 10 % of the plan area. The current-carrying
capacity for cables on ladder systems should be taken as Reference Method E or F.

Cable cleats, cable ties and cable hangers: Cable supports hold the cable at intervals along its length and
permit substantially complete free air flow around the cable. The current-carrying capacity for cable cleats, cable
ties and cable hangers should be taken as Reference Method E or F.

NOTE 1 : These factors are applicable to uniform groups of cables, equally loaded.

NOTE 2: Where horizontal clearances between adjacent cables exceed twice their overall diameter, no rating factor need be applied.
NOTE 3 : The same factors are applied to:
           - groups of two or three single-core cables;
           - multicore cables.
NOTE 4 : If a group consists of both two- and three-core cables, the total number of cables is taken as the number of circuits, and the
           corresponding factor is applied to the tables for two loaded conductors for the two-core cables, and to the Tables for three
           loaded conductors for the three-core cables.
NOTE   5 : If a group consists of n single-core cables it may either be considered as h/2 circuits of two loaded conductors or «/3 circuits of
           three loaded conductors.

NOTE   6 : The rating factors given have been averaged over the range of conductor sizes and types of installation included in Tables
           4D1A to 4J4A and the overall accuracy of tabulated values is within 5 %.
NOTE 7 : For some installations and for other methods not provided for in the above table, it may be appropriate to use factors calculated
           for specific cases, see for example Tables 4C4 and 4C5.

NOTE   8 : Where cables having differing conductor operating temperature are grouped together, the current rating is to be based upon the
           lowest operating temperature of any cable in the group.
NOTE 9:     If, due to known operating conditions, a cable is expected to carry not more than 30 % of its grouped rating, it may be
           ignored for the purpose of obtaining the rating factor for the rest of the group.
           For example, a group of N loaded cables would normally require a group rating factor of Cg applied to the tabulated I,.
           However, if M cables in the group carry loads which are not greater than 0.3 CgI t amperes the other cables can be sized by
           using the group rating factor corresponding to (N-M) cables.

NOTES:
1. The factors in Table 4C6 are applicable to groups of cables all of one size. The value of current derived from application of
   the appropriate factors is the maximum current to be carried by any of the cables in the group.
2. If, due to known operating conditions, a cable is expected to carry not more than 30 % of its grouped rating, it may be
   ignored for the purpose of obtaining the rating factor for the rest of the group.
3. Where cables having different conductor operating temperatures are grouped together the current rating should be based on
   the lowest operating temperature of any cable in the group.
4. When the number of cables used differs from those stated in the table, the rating factor for the next higher stated number of
   cables should be used.

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION CERTIFICATE

Notes for the person producing the Certificate:
   1 The Electrical Installation Certificate is to be used for:
      •   the initial certification of a new installation or for an addition or alteration to an existing installation
          where new circuits have been introduced, or
      °   the replacement of a consumer unit/distribution board, or
      •   certifying for where there are multiple additions, or alterations or remedial works to the existing
          installation which do not extend to new circuits as an alternative to the issue of multiple Minor Electrical
          Installation Works Certificates.
      It is not to be used for periodic inspection and testing, for which an Electrical Installation Condition Report
      should be used. For an addition or alteration which does not extend to the introduction of new circuits, a
      Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate may be used.
      The 'original' Certificate is to be issued to the person ordering the work (Regulation 644.4). A duplicate
      should be retained by the person issuing the certificate.

   2 This Certificate is only valid if the Schedule of Inspections has been completed to confirm that all relevant
     inspections have been carried out and where accompanied by Schedule(s) of Circuit Details and Test Results.

   3 The signatures appended are those of the persons authorized by the companies executing the work of design,
     construction, inspection and testing respectively. A signatory authorized to certify more than one category
     of work should sign in each of the appropriate places. (Where a single signature electrical installation
     certificate is used, the person authorized for executing the work of design, construction, inspection and
     testing shall sign the certificate.)

   4 The time interval recommended before the first periodic inspection must be inserted.
      The proposed date for the next inspection should take into consideration the frequency and quality of
      maintenance that the installation can reasonably be expected to receive during its intended life, and the
      period should be agreed between the designer, installer and other relevant parties.

   5 The page numbers for the Schedule(s) of Circuit Details and Test Results should be indicated, together with
     the total number of pages associated with the certification provided.

   6 The maximum prospective value of fault current (I pf ) recorded should be the greater of either the prospective
     value of short-circuit current or the prospective value of earth fault current.




                                                                                                                         511
ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION CERTIFICATE

GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be appended to the Certificate)

This safety Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it relates has been
designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671.

You should have received an 'original' Certificate and the person that issued the Certificate should have retained
a duplicate. If you were the person ordering the work, but not the owner of the installation, you should pass this
Certificate, or a full copy of it including the schedules, immediately to the owner.

The 'original' Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting or undertaking
further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this Certificate will
demonstrate to the new owner that the electrical installation complied with the requirements of BS 7671 at the
time the Certificate was issued. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations require that, for a project
covered by those Regulations, a copy of this Certificate, together with schedules, is included in the project health
and safety documentation.

For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be inspected at appropriate intervals by a skilled person or
persons, competent in such work. The maximum time interval recommended before the next inspection is stated on
Page 1 under 'NEXT INSPECTION'.

This Certificate is intended to be issued only for a new electrical installation or for new work associated with an
addition or alteration to an existing installation. It should not have been issued for the inspection and testing of an
existing electrical installation. An ’Electrical Installation Condition Report' should be issued for such an inspection.

This Certificate is only valid if the Schedule of Inspections has been completed to confirm that all relevant inspections
have been carried out and where accompanied by Schedule(s) of Circuit Details and Test Results.

Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should be tested six-monthly by pressing the
button marked ‘T’ or ‘Test’. The device should switch off the supply and should then be switched on to restore
the supply. If the device does not switch off the supply when the button is pressed, seek expert advice. For safety
reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.

Where the installation includes an arc fault detection device (AFDD) having a manual test facility it should be
tested six-monthly by pressing the test button. Where an AFDD has both a test button and automatic test function,
manufacturer’s instructions shall be followed with respect to test button operation.

Where the installation includes a surge protective device (SPD) the status indicator should be checked to confirm it
is in operational condition in accordance with manufacturer’s information. If the indication shows that the device is
not operational, seek expert advice. For safety reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.

Where the installation includes alternative or additional sources of supply, warning notices should be found at the
origin or meter position or, if remote from the origin, at the consumer unit or distribution board and at all points of
isolation of all sources of supply.
MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS CERTIFICATE

Notes for the person producing the Certificate:

The Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate is intended to be used for additions and alterations to an
installation that do not extend to the provision of a new circuit. Examples include the addition of socket-outlets or
lighting points to an existing circuit, the relocation of a light switch etc. This Certificate may also be used for the
replacement of equipment such as accessories or luminaires, but not for the replacement of distribution boards or
similar items. Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be carried out irrespective of the extent
of the work undertaken.

MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS CERTIFICATE

GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be appended to the Certificate)

This Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it relates has been designed,
constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671.

You should have received an 'original' Certificate and the person that issued the Certificate should have retained
a duplicate. If you were the person ordering the work, but not the owner of the installation, you should pass this
Certificate, or a copy of it, to the owner. A separate Certificate should have been received for each existing circuit on
which minor works have been carried out. This Certificate is not appropriate if you requested the person that issued
the Certificate to undertake more extensive installation work, for which you should have received an Electrical
Installation Certificate.

The Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting or undertaking further work
on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate the property, this Certificate will demonstrate to the
new owner that the minor electrical installation work carried out complied with the requirements of BS 7671 at the
time the Certificate was issued.

For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be inspected at appropriate intervals by a skilled person or
persons, competent in such work.

Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should be tested six-monthly by pressing the
button marked ‘T’ or ‘Test’. The device should switch off the supply and should then be switched on to restore
the supply. If the device does not switch off the supply when the button is pressed, seek expert advice. For safety
reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.

Where the installation includes an arc fault detection device (AFDD) having a manual test facility it should be
tested six-monthly by pressing the test button. Where an AFDD has both a test button and automatic test function,
manufacturer’s instructions shall be followed with respect to test button operation.

Where the installation includes a surge protective device (SPD) the status indicator should be checked to confirm it
is in operational condition in accordance with manufacturer’s information. If the indication shows that the device is
not operational, seek expert advice. For safety reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.

Where the installation includes alternative or additional sources of supply, warning notices should be found at the
origin or meter position or, if remote from the origin, at the consumer unit or distribution board and at all points of
isolation of all sources of supply.

CONDITION REPORT

Notes for the person producing the Report:
   1 This Report should only be used for reporting on the condition of an existing electrical installation, and not
       for the replacement of a consumer unit/distribution board. An installation which was designed to an earlier
      edition of BS 7671 or the IEE Wiring Regulations and which does not fully comply with the current edition         |
      is not necessarily unsafe for continued use, or requires upgrading. Only damage, deterioration, defects,
      dangerous conditions and non-compliance with the requirements of BS 7671 or the IEE Wiring Regulations,
      which may give rise to danger, should be recorded.
   2 The Report, normally comprising at least five pages, should include schedules of both the inspection and the
      test results. Additional pages may be necessary for other than a simple installation and for the 'Guidance for
      recipients'. The number of each page should be indicated, together with the total number of pages involved.
   3 The reason for producing this Report, such as change of occupancy or landlord’s periodic maintenance,
      should be identified in Section B.
   4 Those elements of the installation that are covered by the Report and those that are not should be identified
      in Section D (Extent and limitations). These aspects should have been agreed with the person ordering the
      report and other interested parties before the inspection and testing commenced. Any operational limitations,
      such as inability to gain access to parts of the installation or an item of equipment, should also be recorded
      in Section D.
    5 The maximum prospective value of fault current (Ipf) recorded should be the greater of either the prospective
      value of short-circuit current or the prospective value of earth fault current.
    6 Where an installation has an alternative source of supply a further schedule of supply characteristics and
      earthing arrangements based upon Section I of this Report should be provided.
    7 A summary of the condition of the installation in terms of safety should be clearly stated in Section E.
      Observations, if any, should be categorised in Section K using the coding C l to C3 as appropriate. Any
      observation given a code C l or C2 classification should result in the overall condition of the installation
      being reported as unsatisfactory.
   8 Wherever practicable, items classified as ‘Danger present’ (Cl) should be made safe on discovery.
     Where this is not possible the owner or user should be given written notification as a matter of urgency.
   9 Where an observation requires farther investigation (FI) because the inspection has revealed an apparent
     deficiency which could not, owing to the extent or limitations of the inspection, be fully identified and
     further investigation may reveal a code C l or C2 item, this should be recorded within Section K, given the
     code FI and marked as unsatisfactory in Section E.
  10 If the space available for observations in Section K is insufficient, additional pages should be provided as
     necessary.
  11 The date by which the next Electrical Installation Condition Report is recommended should be
     given in Section F. The interval between inspections should take into account the requirements of
     Regulation 652.1 and the overall condition of the installation.
  12 Any deficiencies with intake equipment should be reported to the person ordering the work.




                                                                                                                       521
CONDITION REPORT

GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS
(to be appended to the Report)
This Report is an important and valuable document which should be retained for future reference.
    1 The purpose of this Report is to confirm, so far as reasonably practicable, whether or not the electrical
      installation is in a satisfactory condition for continued service (see Section E). The Report should identify
      any damage, deterioration, defects and/or conditions which may give rise to danger (see Section K).
    2 This Report is only valid if accompanied by the Inspection Schedule(s) and the Schedule(s) of Circuit
      Details and Test Results.
   3    The person ordering the Report should have received the 'original' Report and the inspector should have
        retained a duplicate.
    4   The 'original' Report should be retained in a safe place and be made available to any person inspecting
        or undertaking work on the electrical installation in the future. If the property is vacated, this Report will
        provide the new owner/occupier with details of the condition of the electrical installation at the time the
        Report was issued.
    5 Section D (Extent and Limitations) should identify fully the extent of the installation covered by this Report
      and any limitations on the inspection and testing. The inspector should have agreed these aspects with
      the person ordering the Report and with other interested parties (licensing authority, insurance company,
      mortgage provider and the like) before the inspection was carried out.
    6 Some operational limitations such as inability to gain access to parts of the installation or an item of
      equipment may have been encountered during the inspection. The inspector should have noted these in
      Section D.
    7 For items classified in Section K as C l ('Danger present'), the safety of those using the installation is
      at risk, and it is recommended that a skilled person or persons competent in electrical installation work
      undertakes the necessary remedial work immediately.
    8 For items classified in Section K as C2 ('Potentially dangerous'), the safety of those using the installation
      may be at risk and it is recommended that a skilled person or persons competent in electrical installation
      work undertakes the necessary remedial work as a matter of urgency.
   9 Where it has been stated in Section K that an observation requires further investigation (code FI) the
     inspection has revealed an apparent deficiency which may result in a code C l or C2, and could not, due
     to the extent or limitations of the inspection, be fully identified. Such observations should be investigated
     without delay. A further examination of the installation will be necessary, to determine the nature and extent
     of the apparent deficiency (see Section F).
  10 For safety reasons, the electrical installation should be re-inspected at appropriate intervals by a skilled
     person or persons, competent in such work . The recommended date by which the next inspection is due is
     stated in Section F of the Report under ‘Recommendations’.
  11 Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should be tested six-monthly by pressing
     the button marked ‘T’ or ‘Test’. The device should switch off the supply and should then be switched on
     to restore the supply. If the device does not switch off the supply when the button is pressed, seek expert
     advice. For safety reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.
  12 Where the installation includes an arc fault detection device (AFDD) having a manual test facility it should
     be tested six-monthly by pressing the test button. Where an AFDD has both a test button and automatic test
     function, manufacturer’s instructions shall be followed with respect to test button operation.
  13 Where the installation includes a surge protective device (SPD) the status indicator should be checked to
     confirm it is in operational condition in accordance with manufacturer’s information. If the indication shows
     that the device is not operational, seek expert advice. For safety reasons it is important that this instruction
     is followed.
  14 Where the installation includes alternative or additional sources of supply, warning notices should be found
     at the origin or meter position or, if remote from the origin, at the consumer unit or distribution board and at
     all points of isolation of all sources of supply.

4             Protection against overload current
The minimum operating current of the protective device should not exceed 1.45 I z. Where the protective device is
a fuse to BS 88 series or a circuit-breaker to either BS EN 60947-2 or BS EN 60898, this requirement is satisfied
by selecting a value of Iz not less than I n, where In is the rated current or current setting of the device protecting the
circuit against overcurrent.

5             Voltage drop
The voltage drop (Vd) for the busbar trunking or powertrack system is obtained from the manufacturer. It is
usually expressed as mV/ampere/metre, tabulated according to the value of the load-circuit power factor. The
voltage drop given is calculated on the basis of a single load at the end of the run and, in this case, the total
voltage drop = V d x I b x L / 1000 volts, where L is the length of run in metres.

In the case of an evenly distributed load (tapped off at intervals along the busbar trunking or powertrack system)
then the voltage drop at the furthest tap-off point may be taken as 0.5 V d, and is calculated by the above method.

In the case of an unevenly distributed load it will be necessary to calculate the voltage drop for each section between
tap-off points and add them together to find the voltage drop at the furthest tap-off point.

Figure IOC shows that, if a fault occurs in parallel conductor c at point x, the fault current will flow in conductors
1, 2 and 3. The magnitude of the fault current and the proportion of the fault current which flows through protective
devices c s and Cjwill depend on the location of the fault. In this example it has been assumed that the highest
proportion of the fault current will flow through protective device c s. Figure 10D shows that, once c s has operated,
current will still flow to the fault at x via conductors 1 and 2. Because conductors 1 and 2 are in parallel, the current
through protective devices as and bs may not be sufficient for them to operate in the required time. If this is the case,
the protective device Cjis necessary. It should be noted that the current flowing through Cjwill be less than the current
which caused c s to operate. If the fault was close enough to c t then Cjwould operate first. The same situation would
exist if a fault occurred in conductors 1 or 2, hence the protective devices and bj will be required.

The method of providing protective devices at both ends has two disadvantages. Firstly, if a fault at x is cleared by
the operation of cs and then the circuit will continue to operate with the load being carried by conductors 1 and 2.
Hence the fault and subsequent overloading of 1 and 2 may not be detected. Secondly, the fault at x may bum open
circuit at the Cjside leaving one side of the fault live and undetected.

An alternative method to providing protective devices at both ends would be to provide linked protective devices
at the supply end (Figure 10E). This would prevent the continued operation of the circuit under fault conditions.

1              Introduction

Regulation 514.9.2 specifies harmonized standards to be used for user instructions and warning signs. The approach
permits more flexibility in the sizing of appropriate labels for particular circumstances than previous editions of
BS 7671, whilst accounting for an inclusive range of visual clarity and legibility.

This appendix provides particular guidance for the types of safety signs, warning signs and instructions required to
be applied to electrical installations.

2             Text and graphical symbols
An easy to read sans serif font should be used. Examples include, but are not limited to, Arial, Calibri, Helvetica,

                      ESCAPE ROUTES AND FIRE PROTECTION
1              Cables in protected escape routes
Means of escape in a building is the provisions (i.e. the 'means') by which safe escape to a place of safety is
provided. Often, particularly in smaller and simple buildings, this can be achieved simply by limiting the distance
which has to be travelled to an exit from any place in the building. However, in larger and more complex buildings
this is generally not possible and longer distances have to be travelled. It is then necessary to protect escapees during
this longer period of travel.

This is achieved by providing protected escape routes (as defined) in which people escaping from the building are
protected from the effects of fire by a specific fire and smoke-resisting structure. Such protected escape routes are
composed of one or more of the following:
     - Protected lobby
     -   Protected corridor
     - Protected stairway.

These protected routes afford a safe passage through the building to an exit leading to a place of safety, usually the
open air.

For safe escape, it is essential that as well as being enclosed in a fire and smoke-resisting construction these routes
are essentially fire sterile. In other words, ideally they should not contain combustible material which itself could
cause a hazard to the escaping occupants. Thus the amount of combustibles in a protected escape route is strictly
controlled.

For this reason reference should be made to Regulation 422.2.1. Generally this means that cable within a protected
route should be limited to that related to lighting, emergency lighting and fire detection and alarm. In some high
hazard buildings such as chemical plant and nuclear buildings other alarm systems may also need to be included.
Also in buildings such as hospitals with an evacuation strategy that does not involve protected escape routes a
different approach may be justified. These different approaches should be justified in the fire safety strategy for the
building.

Where expert fire safety advice has been obtained, it may be acceptable to install a minimal amount of cable in fully
sealed non-combustible conduit as experience has demonstrated that this does not present an appreciable hazard.
Ferrous metal, e.g. steel, is deemed to be an example of a non-combustible material. There is no restriction on the
use of non-combustible cable (e.g. bare MICC).

Electrical accessories, such as socket-outlets, may be installed within a protected escape route provided that the
structure’s fire resistance is not compromised. It may be necessary to take additional precautions, for example
the installation of internal or external fire resisting pads fitted in accordance with the accessory manufacturers’
guidance. Refer also to Section 527.

Not all lobbies, corridors and stairways are protected escape routes (as defined). It is essential that available
fire safety information on the building (fire safety plans/fire safety strategy/fire risk assessment, as available) be
consulted to identify the protected escape routes. Where inadequate information exists, expert fire safety advice
should be sought.

Cables installed in a fire resisting enclosure are deemed to be outside the protected escape route.

2              Fire sealing
Building elements

Where a wiring system passes through a building element that has specific fire-resistant properties, the ability of
the element to resist the spread of fire will, in all likelihood, have been compromised. If a building element that
has specific fire-resistant properties has been compromised, Regulation 527.2.1 of BS 7671 requires that the ‘...
openings remaining after the passage of the wiring system shall be sealed according to the degree of fire-resistance
(if any) prescribed for the respective element of building construction before penetration’. Guidance on sealing
arrangements should be obtained from a competent person/authority at the design stage.
BS 7671 requires that the seal:
     - resists the products of combustion to the same extent as the elements of building construction which have
       been penetrated, and
     - provides the same degree of protection from water penetration as that required for the building construction
       element in which it has been installed, and
     - is compatible with the material of the wiring system that it is in contact with, and
     - permits thermal movement of the wiring system without reducing the sealing quality, and
     - has adequate mechanical stability to withstand the stresses which may arise through damage to the support
       of the wiring system due to fire.

Internal sealing

Where a wiring system such as conduit, cable ducting, cable trunking, busbar or busbar trunking passes through a
building element that has specific fire resisting properties and has an internal cross-sectional area greater than 710 mm 2,
then it is to be internally sealed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 527.2.3.

Whatever type of material is selected for internal sealing the installer should check that the sealant will not have a
detrimental effect on the enclosed cables, such as chemical reaction on the sheath or insulation of the cables.

External sealing

It is likely that where a wiring system passes through a building element that has specific fire-resistant properties,
the hole formed will be larger than that required for the wiring system. This surrounding area should also be sealed,
such that the degree of fire resistance required for the element concerned is maintained. Reference should be made
to Regulation 527.2.1




                                                                                                                               553

              RING AND RADIAL FINAL CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENTS,
                           REGULATION 433.1
This appendix sets out options for the design of ring and radial final circuits for household and similar premises in
accordance with Regulation 433.1, using socket-outlets and fused connection units. It does not cover other aspects
of the design of a circuit such as:
    -    Protection against electric shock, Chapter 41
    -    Protection against thermal effects, Chapter 42
    -    Protection against overcurrent, Chapter 43
    -    Selection and erection of equipment, Part 5.

                     Fig 1 5 A - Ring final circuit arrangements, Regulation 433.1.204

The load current in any part of the circuit should be unlikely to exceed for long periods the current-carrying capacity
of the cable (Regulation 433.1.204 refers). This can generally be achieved by:

   (i) locating socket-outlets to provide reasonable sharing of the load around the ring
  (ii) not supplying immersion heaters, comprehensive electric space heating or loads of a similar profile from the
       ring circuit
 (iii) connecting cookers, ovens and hobs with a rated power exceeding 2 kW on their own dedicated radial circuit
  (iv)   taking account of the total floor area being served. (Historically, a limit of 100 m 2 has been adopted.)

                                             ENERGY EFFICIENCY
17.1           Scope

This appendix provides additional recommendations for the design and erection of electrical installations, including
installations having local production and storage of energy, for optimizing the overall efficient use of electricity.
NOTE:      On-site renewable energy sources and other local production sources do not of themselves increase the efficiency of
           an electrical installation. However, they do reduce the overall public electricity network losses as the consumption of
           the installation from the public supply is reduced. This may be considered an indirect energy efficiency measure. For
           installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems, see Section 712 of BS 7671.

The recommendations within the scope of this appendix apply for new electrical installations and modification of
existing installations. Much of this appendix will not apply to dwellings and similar installations. In dwellings and
similar installations it is recommended that use is made of LED lighting. Reference should also be made to the
Building Regulations - Part L in England and Wales, the Technical Handbook in Scotland and Technical Booklets F in
Northern Ireland.

It is intended that this appendix will be developed into a section of Part 8 of BS 7671 in a future amendment.

17.2           Availability of electrical energy and user decision

The user specification will be the key input to the design of the energy efficiency management system.

The designer should take into account at least the following considerations:
   (i) Selection of energy efficient appliances
  (ii) Assignment of load priority for use as an input of the load optimization process (e.g. load shedding)
  (iii) Intended use of the installation in providing an energy efficient design
  (iv) Provision of a manual override facility which enables the user to take control from the automatic functions.

Energy efficiency management should be so designed that it does not reduce electrical supply availability and/or
services or operation below the level desired by the user. The user of the electrical installation must be able to take
the final decision over whether or not to operate a service at nominal value, or optimized value or not to operate it
for a certain time.
NOTE:     Examples are when someone is ill, the user may decide to heat the room at a higher temperature, even during peak
          consumption; when a company receives an urgent delivery order, the workshop may need to work at an unexpected
          hour.

17.3           Design requirements

The designer should take into account the following without losing the quality of service and the performance of
the electrical installation:
   (i)   Load energy profile (active and passive)
  (ii) Availability of local generation (solar, wind, generator, etc.)
 (iii) Reduction of energy losses in the electrical installation
  (iv)   The tariff structure offered by the supplier of electrical energy
  (v) The arrangement of the circuits with regard to energy efficiency (meshes, see 17.5)
  (vi) The use of energy according to customer demand.

In order to benchmark the achievement of electrical energy efficiency measures, an overall energy efficiency
assessment should be made.

17.4           Design recommendations

Determination of load profile

The main load demands within the installation have to be determined. The loads, together with their durations
of operation, and/or an estimate of the annual load consumption of the main load demands (in kWh) should be
identified.




                                                                                                                                     563
      Voltage drop
      Consideration should be given to limiting the voltage drop within an installation to a level below that required by
      Regulation 525.202, to reduce the energy losses in the wiring systems.

      Cross-sectional areas of conductors
      Increasing the cross-sectional area of conductors will reduce the energy losses but will increase initial installation
      costs. The decision as to whether to do this should be made by assessing both the savings within a time scale and
      the additional cost due to the increased size. Practical constraints, such as size of terminations, will also affect the
      sizing of conductors.
      NOTE:      In some applications (particularly industrial), the most economical cross-sectional area of conductor may be several
                 sizes larger than that required for the design current.

      Power factor correction
      Consideration should be given to improving the load power factor to reduce thermal losses in the wiring and tariff
      penalties.

      Power factor correction can be made at the load level or centrally, depending on the type of application. The
      complexity of the issue requires careful consideration of each individual application.

      17.5           Determination of zones and meshes
      The installation should be divided into zones and meshes for the purpose of energy efficiency and analysis. A zone
      represents a floor area in square metres or a location where the electricity is used.
      NOTE: Zones may correspond, for example, to:
               - an industrial workshop
               - a floor in building
               - a space near windows or a space far from windows
               - a room in a dwelling
               - highway road lighting
               - a hotel kitchen.

      A Mesh is one or more circuits of the electrical installation for one or more zones including one or more services
      supplying a group of electrical equipment for the purpose of electrical energy efficiency. One circuit belongs to one
      mesh or a cluster of meshes.

      Electrical management for energy efficiency is a system approach aiming to optimize the management of energy used
      for a specific service within a defined ‘electrical mesh’, taking into account all necessary information concerning the
      technical and economic approaches.

      17.6          Determining the usages within the identified zones
      The use of a particular circuit or zone should be clearly identified to enable accurate measurement and analysis of
      its energy consumption.
      NOTE:     Examples of different usages are:
                   - hot water production
                   - HVAC (cooling and heating)
                   - lighting
                   - motors
                   - appliances.

      17.7          Energy efficiency and load management system

      User requirements
      User requirements are the first input to take into consideration. These requirements will be the key input to the
      design of the energy efficiency management system. Actions may include, amongst other things:
         (i)   Desk studies
        (ii)   Previous design considerations
       (iii) Energy consumption records.




564
The designer, and/or end user should agree on the daily, weekly, monthly or yearly schedule for the periods when
some services or applications shall be available or can be reduced or shut off. Identifying these applications and
gathering them in a mesh are key from an energy usage point of view.

Requirements on the loads

The designer and installer must take into account the user decisions on selection of energy efficient appliances.

The user may give priority to the usage of the different loads as an input of the load optimization process (e.g. load
shedding).

17.8           Inputs from loads, sensors and forecasts

Requirements on accuracy and measuring range
Provision must be made to allow the measurement and recording of energy consumption throughout the major parts
of the installation, to provide for the management of that consumption. Accuracy of measurement should at least
comply with the following:
     - the meter at the origin of the loads must be accurate for billing purposes and can be used for the measurement
       of the efficiency of the whole installation
     - at a lower level it may be necessary to provide measurement with an accuracy allowing sub-billing within
       the same entity. For example, a company such as a hotel may wish to charge the department for catering
       separately from the department in charge of entertainment
     - at the lowest level of the final circuit directly powering loads it can be enough to provide information for
       following trends without precise needs for current to power conversion.

Measurement is a key parameter to determine the efficiency of the installation giving the user an awareness of
energy consumption. Consequently, device accuracy and measuring range must be adapted to the intended use, as
close as possible to the loads.

17.9          Loads
Loads should be classified regarding their user's acceptance of load shedding. Some loads, such as information
technology equipment systems, computers and TV sets, are not suitable for load shedding. Others, such as heaters,
refrigerators and electric vehicles, can accept a load shedding for up to a certain length of time without any impact
on their service.

For each type of load, an acceptable duration of shedding in normal conditions should be determined.
NOTE 1 : Examples of acceptable durations of shedding are 50 ms for a lamp and 15 minutes for a refrigerator or heater.
NOTE 2: Information on the ability of loads to accept, or not, load shedding and the corresponding duration(s) is useful.

Energy sensors
Energy-sensing devices should be of at least the same class as the energy performance and monitoring devices
defined in Annex D o f B S EN 61557-12.

Forecasts
Forecasts can be used as inputs to the energy efficiency management system, such as weather and occupancy
forecasts.

Data logging
Historical data, where available, can be an input for making energy demand forecasts.

To achieve a design capable of delivering a high level of energy efficiency, all available energy consumption data
should be taken into account.

17.10         Inputs from the supplies: energy availability and pricing, smart metering
The user should consider information concerning the energy availability and pricing which may vary with time.

Where the supply is a local source, the user should consider the minimum and/or the maximum available power and
define the price of the corresponding energy based on the total cost of ownership including fixed and variable costs.




                                                                                                                            565
17.11          Impacts on the design of an electrical installation
The design of an electrical installation should consider energy efficiency at every stage, including the impact of
different load demands, usage, zones and meshes.

The installation of fixed equipment for power metering and monitoring devices, control and energy management
should be considered for new installations and future modifications.

Distribution switchboards should enable the segregation of circuits supplying each zone or each mesh as defined.

17.12          Information for the user: monitoring the electrical installation
The installation should be designed to enable the measurement of its total consumption in kWh for every hour of
each day. This data, and the related cost of energy information, should be logged and stored for a minimum of one
year and be accessible to the user.
NOTE:      Multiple years of data can be useful for effective trend analysis.

In addition, by the use of sub-metering for example, the installation should be designed to enable the recording and
saving of data for the consumption of individual or grouped loads totalling 97 % of the total load.

An energy efficiency management system comprises monitors for the whole electrical installation, including
loads, local production and storage. It can manually (easiest cases) or automatically (most situations) monitor the
electrical installation so as to allow optimization of the overall consumption of the system, taking into account the
user requirements and the input parameters coming from the public electricity supply network, local electricity
production and storage, the loads, sensors, and forecasts etc.

17.13          Efficiency measures for equipment

Motors and controls
An AC induction motor will consume more energy than it actually needs when operated at less than full-load
conditions. This excess consumption of energy is dissipated by the motor in the form of heat. A better choice of
motor and motor control will improve the global energy efficiency of the electric motor system.

Motors with a rated output of 0.75 kW - 375 kW must meet either the IE3 efficiency level or the IE2 level and be
equipped with a variable speed drive. The energy efficiency classes are as follows:
     -   IE2 (High efficiency)
     -   IE3 (Premium efficiency)
     - IE4 (Super premium efficiency).
NOTE 1 : See BS EN 60034-30-1 Rotating electrical machines: Efficiency classes of line operated AC motors (IE code).

As about 95 % of the operating cost of a motor comes from its electrical energy consumption, adopting a higher
energy efficiency class according to BS EN 60034-30-1, especially for high-duty applications, saves significant
energy.

Consideration should be given to the use of motor starters, or other motor control devices such as variable speed
drives, to achieve higher energy efficiency, particularly for efficient management of energy for intensive consumption
applications (e.g. flow control of fans, pumps, air compressors).

Examples of aspects to be considered are:
     - reducing electrical energy consumption
     -   optimizing the rated power
     - reducing the inrush current
     - reducing noise and vibration, in this way avoiding mechanical damage and failures within the air conditioning
       or heating system
     - better control and better accuracy in achieving required flow and pressure.
N O T E 2 : In industry, it is understood that 60 % of consumed electricity is used to turn motors and 63 % of this energy is used
          for applications such as pumps and fans.
Lighting
Lighting can represent a large amount of energy consumption in an electrical installation, depending upon the type
of lamps and luminaires selected for each application. Lighting control is one of the easiest ways to improve energy
efficiency. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to lighting control. The type of lamp, ballast switchgear
and controlgear should be taken into consideration when applying lighting control. Building regulations have
specific requirements on the selection of luminaire types for locations, the minimum required energy performance
of luminaires and energy consumption per square metre of the installation.
NOTE: Solutions for lighting control can improve the energy efficiency by more than 50 %. These systems should be flexible
      and designed for the comfort of the users. The solutions can range from very small and local, such as with timer
      and occupancy sensors, up to sophisticated customized and centralized solutions that are part of complete building
      automation systems.

To operate lighting only when and where needed, permanent control of lighting may be implemented by using, for
example:
     - movement detectors
     - dimming controls
     - timed switches
     - light-sensitive switches
     - constant brightness controls.

Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
Consideration should be given to:
     - the choice of HVAC equipment depending on the installation structure and usage
     - the appropriate control system to optimize environment control (e.g. temperature, humidity, etc.) depending
       on the usage and occupancy of individual spaces.
NOTE:     An example is a heating system controlled by a timer and thermostat monitoring the temperature threshold according
          to the expected occupancy.

17.14         Distribution system
Wiring systems
The cross-sectional areas of conductors may be optimized to reduce losses.

The electrical infrastructure may be optimized by locating the power source at an appropriate position to minimize
circuit lengths.

The impact of thermal losses, off-load consumption and on-load energy consumption of equipment connected in
the wiring system, e.g. switchgear and controlgear, power monitors and relays included in an electrical circuit, is
negligible compared to the energy used in the load and in the energy transportation.

Power factor correction
Reduction of reactive current improves electrical energy efficiency by, for example, reducing thermal losses in
wiring systems.

Where a reduction of reactive current is required, the optimized level of reactive current should be determined. This
level generally depends on the public electricity supply contract.

In order to reduce reactive current, the following may be implemented:
     - selection of current-using equipment with low reactive current component
     - systems for compensation of reactive energy by using capacitors.
NOTE: Harmonic distortion rate and voltage impulse are important considerations for selecting capacitor banks. The provision
      of harmonic filters may need to be considered.

Energy
It is of prime importance, in terms of electrical energy efficiency, to ascertain by either calculation or measurement,
the energy consumption of each item of current-using equipment.




                                                                                                                               567
Load profile

Measurement of the energy used is necessary to give a load profile. This should be over a period of a minimum of
24 h to give a reasonable estimate of load profile.
NOTE:    The time period of measurement is typically from every 10 mins to 1 hour. The time period varies depending on the
         usage, zone and the sector of activity, and also the season (especially for lighting and HVAC).

Voltage drop

Voltage drop reduces energy efficiency of the electrical installation.

Where the voltage drop measurement is required, voltage measurements should be made on the current-using
equipment and at the origin of the circuit serving the current-using equipment.

17.15         Periodic assessment

Where an electrical installation has been designed with energy efficiency measures, it may be appropriate periodically
to confinn that such measures remain in line with any energy efficiency measures that exist.

Where a periodic assessment identifies the electrical installation efficiency is lower than the required value, an
action plan is typically needed to achieve the required or desired electrical installation efficiency class.
