            About the author
            I started in the electrotechnical industry while still at school, chasing walls for my
            brother-in-law for a bit of pocket money. This taught me quickly that if I took a
            career as an electrician I needed to progress as fast as I could.
            Jobs in the industry were few and far between when I left school so, after a spell
            in the armed forces, I gained a place as a sponsored trainee on the Construction
            Industry Training Board (CITB) training scheme. I attended block release at
            Guildford Technical College, where the CITB would find me work experience
            with ‘local’ employers. My first and only work experience placement was with a
            computer installation company located over 20 miles away, so I had to cycle there
            every morning, but I was desperate to learn and enjoyed my work.
            Computer installations were very different in those days. Computers filled large
            rooms and needed massive armoured supply cables, so the range of work I
            experienced was vast – from data cabling to all types of containment systems and
            low-voltage systems.
            In the second year of my apprenticeship I found employment with a company
            where most of my work centred around the London area. The work was varied,
            from lift systems in well-known high-rise buildings to lightning protection on the
            sides of even higher ones!
            On completion of my apprenticeship I worked for a short time as an intruder
            alarm installer, mainly in domestic dwellings – a role in which client relationships
            and handling information are very important.
            Following this I began work with a company where I was involved in shop-fitting
            and restaurant and pub refurbishments. It wasn’t long before I was managing jobs
            and gaining further qualifications through professional development. I was later
            seconded to the Property Services Agency, designing major installations within
            some of the best-known buildings in the UK.
            A career-changing accident took me into teaching, where I truly found the
            rewards the industry has to offer. Seeing young trainees maturing into qualified
            electricians is a highly gratifying experience. I often see many of my old trainees
            when they attend further training and updated courses. Following their successes
            makes it all worthwhile.
            I have worked with City & Guilds for over 25 years and represented them on
            a variety of industry committees, such as JPEL/64, which is responsible for the
            production of BS 7671. I am passionate about using my extensive experience to
            maintain the high standards the industry expects.

            ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES




               INTRODUCTION
               A large number of scientific studies show that climate change is causing more frequent and more extreme
               weather events around our planet and CO2 emissions are a clear contributor towards this.
               The use of energy storage and generating systems, as well as renewable technologies, will help to minimise
               climate change or its effects by reducing emissions.
               The construction industry is already going some way to reduce emissions but needs to further promote and
               utilise these technologies in buildings.
               Much of the decline in harmful emissions is due to new technologies used in building materials, insulation and
               renewable energy sources. When working in the electrotechnical sector, you are very likely to come across
               these technologies. This chapter is intended to explain how they work.

            In general, under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, before any building             Permitted development:
            work that increases the size of a building is carried out, a planning application         Allows certain projects
            must be submitted to the local authority. A certain amount of building work is,           or building work to be
            however, allowed without the need for a planning application. This is known as            carried out without
            permitted development.                                                                    the need for planning
                                                                                                      permission.
            Permitted development usually comes with criteria that must be met. When building         Microgeneration: The
            an extension, for example, it may be possible to do so under permitted development,       small-scale generation
            if the extension is under a certain size, is a certain distance away from the boundary    of heat or electric
            of the property and is not at the front of the property. If the extension does not        power by individuals,
            meet these criteria, then a full planning application must be made.                       small businesses and
                                                                                                      communities to meet
            Permitted development is intended to ease the burden placed on local authorities          their own needs, as
            and to smooth the process for the builder or installer. Permitted development exists      alternatives or in addition

            Solar thermal collector
            A solar thermal collector is designed to collect heat by absorbing heat radiation
            from the Sun. The energy from the Sun heats the heat-transfer fluid contained in
            the system. There are two types of solar thermal collector:
            ●   flat-plate collectors
            ●   evacuated-tube collectors.
            Flat-plate collectors are less efficient but cheaper than evacuated-tube
            collectors. With a flat-plate collector, the heat-transfer fluid circulates through
            the collectors and is directly heated by the Sun. The collectors need to be well
            insulated to avoid heat loss.

            Evacuated-tube collectors are more efficient but more expensive than flat-plate
            collectors.
            An evacuated-tube collector consists of a specially coated, pressure-resistant,
            double-walled glass tube. The air is evacuated from the glass tube to aid the
            transfer of heat from the Sun to a heat tube that is housed within the glass tube.
            The heat tube contains a temperature-sensitive medium, such as methanol, that,
            when heated, vaporises. The warmed gas rises within the glass tube. A solar
            collector will contain several evacuated tubes in contact with a copper header tube
            that is part of the solar heating circuit. The heat tube is in contact with the header
            tube. The heat from the methanol vapour in the heat tubes is transferred by
            conduction to the heat-transfer fluid flowing through the solar heating circuit. This
            process cools the methanol vapour, which condenses and runs back down to the
            bottom of the heat tubes, ready for the process to start again. The collector must
            be mounted at a suitable angle to allow the vapour to rise and the condensed
            liquid to flow back down the heat tubes.

                                             Differential temperature controller
                                             The differential temperature controller (DTC) has sensors connected to the solar
                                             collector (high level) and the hot-water storage system (low level). It monitors
                                             the temperatures at the two points. The DTC turns the circulating pump on when
                                             there is enough solar energy available and there is a demand for water to be
                                             heated. Once the stored water reaches the required temperature, the DTC shuts
                                             off the circulating pump.

                                             Circulating pump
                                             The circulating pump is controlled by the DTC and circulates the system’s heat-
                                             transfer fluid around the solar hot-water circuit. The circuit is a closed loop
                                             between the solar collector and the hot-water storage tank. The heat-transfer
                                             fluid is normally water-based but, depending on the system type, usually also
                                             contains antifreeze (glycol) so that at night, or in periods of low temperatures, it
                                             does not freeze in the collector.

                                             Hot-water storage cylinder
                                             The hot-water storage cylinder enables the transfer of heat from the solar
                                             collector circuit to the stored water. Several different types of cylinder or cylinder
                                             arrangement are possible.

                                             Twin-coil cylinder
                                             With this type of cylinder, the lower coil is the solar heating circuit and the upper
                                             coil is the auxiliary heating circuit. Cold water enters at the base of the cylinder
                                             and is heated by the solar heating coil. If the solar heating circuit cannot meet the
                                             required demand, then the boiler will provide heat through the upper coil. Hot
                                             water is drawn off, by the taps, from the top of the cylinder.

            Alternatives
            An alternative arrangement is to use one cylinder as a solar preheat cylinder,
            the output of which feeds a hot-water cylinder. The auxiliary heating circuit is
            connected to the second cylinder.

             Figure 1.6 Using two separate cylinders
            The two arrangements that have been described are indirect systems, with the
            solar heating circuit forming a closed loop.

            Direct system
            A direct system is an alternative to an indirect system. In direct systems, the
            domestic hot water that is stored in the cylinder is directly circulated through the
            solar collector and is the same water that is drawn off at the taps. Owing to this
            fact, antifreeze (glycol) cannot be used in the system, so it is important to use
            freeze-tolerant collectors.

            Auxiliary heat source
            In the UK there will be times when there is insufficient solar energy available to
            provide adequate hot water. On these occasions an auxiliary heat source will be
                                                                                                                                    7

                                           required. Where the premises have space heating systems installed, the auxiliary
                                           heat source is usually this boiler. Where no suitable boiler exists, the auxiliary heat
                                           source will be an electric immersion heater.

                                           Location and building requirements
                                           The following factors should be considered when deciding whether or not a solar
                                           thermal hot-water system is suitable for particular premises.

                                           The orientation of the solar collectors
                                           The optimum direction for the solar collectors to face is due south. However,
                                           as the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west, any location with a roof facing
                                           east, south or west is suitable for mounting a solar thermal system, although the
                                           efficiency of the system will be reduced for any system not facing due south.

                                           The tilt of the solar collectors
                                           During the year, the maximum elevation or height of the Sun, relative to the
                                           horizon, changes. It is lowest in December and highest in June. Ideally, solar
                                           collectors should always be perpendicular to the path of the Sun’s rays. As it is
                                           generally not practical to change the tilt angle of a solar collector, a compromise
                                           angle has to be used. In the UK, the angle is 35°; however, the collectors will work,
                                           but less efficiently, from vertical through to horizontal.

                                           Shading of the solar collectors
                                           Any structure, tree, chimney, aerial or other object that stands between the
                                           collector and the Sun will block the Sun’s energy. The Sun shines for a limited time
                                           and any reduction in the amount of heat energy reaching the collector will reduce
                                           the collector’s ability to provide hot water to meet the demand.

                                           The suitability of the structure for mounting the solar collector
                                           The structure has to be assessed as to its suitability for the chosen mounting
                                           system. Consideration needs to be given to the strength and condition of the
                                           structure and the suitability of fixings. The effect of wind must also be taken into
                                           account. The force exerted by the wind on the collectors, an upward force known
                                           as ‘wind uplift’, affects both the solar collector fixings and the fixings holding the
                                           roof members to the building structure.
                                           In the case of roof-mounted systems on blocks of flats and other shared
                                           properties, the ownership of the structure on which the proposed system is to be
                                           installed must be considered.

            The space needed to mount the collectors is dependent on the demand for hot
            water. The number of people occupying the premises determines the demand for
            hot water and, therefore, the number of collectors required, and the space needed
            to mount them.

            The criteria that must be met for both stand-alone and building-mounted
            systems are that:
            ●    the system cannot be installed in the grounds, or on a building within the
                 grounds, of a listed building or a scheduled monument

            Working principles
            Heat energy from the Sun exists in the air that surrounds us and in the ground
            beneath our feet. At absolute zero or 0 K (kelvin), there is no heat in a system.
            This temperature is equivalent to –273°C so, even with an outside temperature
            of –10°C, there is a vast amount of free heat energy available.

                –273                                    –10         0                 20

             Figure 1.8 Heat energy exists down to absolute zero (0 K ≈ –273°C)
            Using a relatively small amount of energy, that stored heat energy in the air or in
            the ground can be extracted and used in the heating of living accommodation.
            Heat pumps extract heat from outside and transfer it inside, in much the same
            way that a refrigerator extracts heat from the inside of the refrigerator and
            releases it at the back of the refrigerator via the heat-exchange fins.
            A basic rule of heat transfer is that heat moves from warmer spaces to colder
            spaces.
            A heat pump contains a refrigerant. The external air or ground is the medium or
            heat source that gives up its heat energy. The heat pump operates as follows.
            ●    When the refrigerant is passed through the                                         Heating system
                 heat source, the refrigerant is cooler than
                 its surroundings and so absorbs heat.
            ●    The compressor on the heat pump then
                 compresses the refrigerant, causing the gas
                 to heat up.                                                                     Condenser
            ●    When the refrigerant is passed to the
                 interior, the refrigerant is now hotter than
                 its surroundings and gives up its heat to
                 the cooler surroundings.                               Expansion valve
            ●    The refrigerant is then allowed to expand,
                 which converts it back into a liquid.
            ●    As the refrigerant expands, it cools, and the
                 cycle starts all over again.
            The only energy needed to drive the system
            is the energy required by the compressor.                                                                              Compressor
            The greater the difference in temperature
            between the refrigerant and the heat-source
            medium from where heat is being extracted,
            the greater the efficiency of the heat pump. If                                     Evaporator
            the heat-source medium is very cold, then the
            refrigerant will need to be colder, to be able
            to absorb heat, so the harder the compressor
            must work, and the more energy is needed to                                               Outside air
            accomplish this.                                             Figure 1.9 The refrigeration process

            Ground-source heat pumps
            A ground-source heat pump (GSHP) extracts low-temperature free heat from the
            ground, upgrades it to a higher temperature and then releases it, where required,
            for space heating and water heating.

            Working principles
            The key components of a GSHP are:
            ●    heat-collection loops and a pump
            ●    a heat pump
            ●    a heating system.
            The collection of heat from the ground is accomplished by means of pipes that
            are buried in the ground and contain a mixture of water and antifreeze. This type
            of system is known as a ‘closed-loop’ system. Three methods of burying the pipes
            are used. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

            Horizontal loops
            Piping is installed in horizontal trenches that are generally 1.5–2 m deep.
            Horizontal loops require more piping than vertical loops – around 200 m of piping
            for the average house.

            Final heat output from the GSHP is at a lower temperature than would be
            obtained from a gas boiler. The heat output from a GSHP is at 40°C, compared
            with a gas boiler at 60–80°C. For this reason, under-floor heating, which requires
            temperatures of 30–35°C, is the most suitable form of heating arrangement to
            use with a GSHP. Low-temperature or oversized radiators could also be used.
            A GSHP system, in itself, is unable to heat hot water directly to a suitable
            temperature. Hot water needs to be stored at a temperature of 60°C. An auxiliary
            heating device will be necessary in order to reach the required temperatures. A
            GSHP is unable to provide instant heat and, for maximum efficiency, should run
            all the time. In some cases, it is beneficial to fit a buffer tank to the output so
            that any excess heat is stored, ready to be used when required. By reversing the
            refrigeration process, a GSHP can also be used to provide cooling in the summer.

            Location and building requirements
            For a GSHP system to work effectively, and as the output temperature is low, the
            building must be well insulated.
            A suitable amount of land has to be available for trenches or, alternatively, land that
            is suitable for bore holes. In either case, access for machinery will be required.

            Planning permission
            The installation of a GSHP is usually considered to be permitted development and
            will not require a planning application to be made.

            ●    the design and installation are complex tasks
            ●    they are unlikely to work efficiently with an existing heating system
            ●    they use refrigerants, which could be harmful to the environment
            ●    they are more expensive to install than air-source heat pumps.

            Air-source heat pumps
            An air-source heat pump (ASHP) extracts free heat from low-temperature air and
            releases it, where required, for space heating and water heating.
            The key components of an ASHP are:
            ●    a heat pump containing a heat exchanger, a compressor and an expansion
                 valve
            ●    a heating system.

            Working principles
            An ASHP works in a similar way to a refrigerator, but the cooled area becomes the
            outside world and the area where the heat is released is the inside of a building.
            The steps involved in the ASHP process are as follows.
            ●    The pipes of the pump system contain refrigerant that can be a liquid or a gas,
                 depending on the stage of the cycle. The refrigerant, as a gas, flows through a
                 heat exchanger (evaporator), where low-temperature air from outside is drawn
                 across the heat exchanger by means of the unit’s internal fan. The heat from
                 the air warms the refrigerant. Any liquid refrigerant boils to gas.
            ●    The warmed refrigerant vapour then flows to a compressor. Here, the
                 refrigerant vapour is compressed, causing its temperature to rise further.
            ●    Following this pressurisation stage, the refrigerant gas passes through another
                 heat exchanger (condenser), where it loses heat to the heating-system
                 water, because it is hotter than the system water. At this stage, some of the
                 refrigerant has condensed to a liquid. The heating system carries heat away to
                 heat the building.
            ●    The cooled refrigerant passes through an expansion valve, where its pressure
                 drops suddenly and its temperature falls. The refrigerant flows once more to
                 the evaporator heat exchanger, continuing the cycle.

                                                                     Compressor

                                           There are two types of ASHP in common use. These are:
                                           ●   air-to-water pumps
                                           ●   air-to-air pumps.
                                           An air-to-water pump is the pump described above, and it can be used to provide
                                           both space heating and water heating. An air-to-air pump is not suitable for
                                           providing water heating.
                                           The output temperature of an ASHP will be lower than that of a gas-fired boiler.
                                           Ideally, the ASHP should be used in conjunction with an under-floor heating
                                           system. Alternatively, it could be used with low-temperature radiators.

                                           Location and building requirements
                                           The following factors should be considered when deciding whether or not an
                                           ASHP is suitable for particular premises.
                                           ●   The premises must be well insulated.
                                           ●   There must be space to fit the unit on the ground outside the building or to
                                               mount it on a wall. There will also need to be clear space around the unit to
                                               allow an adequate airflow.
                                           ●   The ideal heating system to couple to an ASHP is either under-floor heating or
                                               warm-air heating.
                                           ●   An ASHP will pay for itself in a shorter period of time if it replaces an electric,
                                               coal or oil heating system rather than a gas-fired boiler.
                                           Air-source heat pumps are an ideal solution for new-build properties, where high
                                           levels of insulation and under-floor heating are to be installed.

                                           Planning permission
                                           Permitted development applies where an ASHP is installed:
                                           ●   on a dwelling house or block of flats
                                           ●   on a building within the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats
                                           ●   in the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats.
                                           There are, however, criteria to be met, mainly due to noise generated by the ASHP.
                                           ●   The ASHP must comply with the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS)
                                               Planning Standards or equivalent.
                                           ●   Only one ASHP may be installed on the building or within the grounds of the
                                               building.
                                           ●   A wind turbine must not be installed on the building or within the grounds of
                                               the building.
                                           ●   The volume of the outdoor unit’s compressor must not exceed 0.6 m3.
                                           ●   The ASHP cannot be installed within 1 m of the boundary.
                                           ●   The ASHP cannot be installed on a pitched roof.
                                           ●   If the ASHP is installed on a flat roof, it must not be within 1 m of the roof
                                               edge.
                                           ●   The ASHP cannot be installed on a site designated as a monument.

            ●     The ASHP cannot be installed on a building that is a listed building, or in its
                  grounds.
            ●     The ASHP cannot be installed on a roof or a wall that fronts a highway, or
                  within a conservation area or World Heritage Site.
            ●     If the dwelling is in a conservation area or a World Heritage Site, then the
                  ASHP cannot be closer to a highway than the house or block of flats.

            Other regulatory requirements to consider
            Other regulatory requirements to consider regarding the installation of ASHPs are:
            ●     BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition including
                  amendments

            The advantages and disadvantages of air-source
            heat pumps
            The advantages of ASHPs are that they:
            ●     are highly efficient
            ●     are cheaper to run than electric, gas or oil boilers, leading to reductions in the
                  cost of energy bills
            ●     reduce CO2 emissions
            ●     generate no CO2 emissions on site
            ●     are safe, because no combustion takes place and there is no emission of
                  potentially dangerous gases
            ●     are low maintenance compared with combustion devices
            ●     do not require fuel storage, so less installation space is required

                                           ●   are cheaper and easier to install than ground-source heat pumps.
                                           The disadvantages of ASHPs are that they:
                                           ●   are unlikely to work efficiently with an existing heating system
                                           ●   are not as efficient as ground-source heat pumps
                                           ●   have high initial costs
                                           ●   are less efficient in the winter than in the summer
                                           ●   generate noise from the fans
                                           ●   have to incorporate a defrost cycle to stop the heat exchanger freezing in the

                                           Biomass
                                           The major difference between biomass and fossil fuels, both of which are
                                           derived from the same source, is time. Fossil fuels, such as gas, oil and coal, have
                                           taken millions of years to form. Demand for these fuels is outstripping supply
                                           and replenishment. Biomass is derived from recently living organisms. As long
              KEY TERM                     as these organisms are replaced by replanting, and demand does not exceed

                                               gas emissions, which have a detrimental effect on the environment.


                                           Both fossil fuels and biomass fuels are burned to produce heat, and both fuel
                                           types release CO2 as part of this process. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that
                                           has been linked to global warming. During their lives, plants and trees absorb
                                           CO2 from the atmosphere, to enable growth to take place. When these plants are
                                           burned, the CO2 is released once again into the atmosphere.
                                           Biomass fuels have two main carbon advantages over fossil fuels.
                                           ●   Fossil fuels absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere millions of years ago and have
                                               trapped that CO2 ever since. When fossil fuels are burned, they release the CO2
                                               from all those millions of years ago and so add to the present-day atmospheric
                                               CO2 level.
                                           ●   Biomass absorbs CO2 when it grows, reducing current atmospheric CO2 levels.
                                               When biomass is turned into fuel and burned, it releases the CO2 back into the
                                               atmosphere. The net result is that there is no overall increase in the amount of
                                               CO2 in the atmosphere.

            A disadvantage of biomass is that the material
            is less dense than fossil fuels, so to achieve the                   CO2

            with careful management, the use of biomass is
            sustainable, whereas the use of fossil fuels
            is not.

            Wood-related products are the primary
            biomass fuels for domestic use.
            For wood to work as a sustainable material, the trees used need to be relatively
            fast growing, so short-rotation coppice woodlands containing willow, hazel
            and poplar are used on a 3–5-year rotation. Because of this, large logs are not
            available, neither can slow-growing timbers that would have a higher calorific
            value be used. Woody biomass as a fuel is generally supplied as:

            The calorific value of woody biomass is generally low. The greener (wetter) the
            wood is, the lower the calorific value will be.

            Woody biomass boilers
            A biomass boiler can be as simple as a log-burner providing heat to a single
            room or may be a boiler heating a whole house. Woody biomass boilers can
            be automated so that a constant supply of fuel is available. Wood pellets are
            transferred to a combustion chamber by means of an auger drive or, if the fuel
            storage is remote from the boiler, by a suction system. The combustion process is
            monitored via thermostats in the flue gases, and adjustments are made to the fan
            speed, which controls air intake, and to the fuel-feed system, to control the feed
            of pellets. All of this is controlled by a microprocessor.

                                                The hot flue gases are passed across a heat exchanger, where the heat is
                        INDUSTRY TIP            transferred to the water in the central-heating system. From this point, the heated
                                                water is circulated around a standard central-heating system.
              In automated biomass boilers,
              the heat exchangers are
              self-cleaning and the amount
              of ash produced is relatively
              small. As a result, the boilers
              require little maintenance.
              The waste gases are taken
              away from the boiler by the
              flue and are then dispersed
              via the flue terminal.

                                                biomass boiler is suitable for particular premises.
                                                ●   Space will be required for the storage of the biomass fuel.
                                                ●   Easy access will be required for the delivery of the biomass fuel.
                                                ●   A biomass boiler may not be permitted in a designated smokeless zone.

                                                In the past, when it was common to burn coal as a source of domestic heat or
                                                for the commercial generation of heat and power, many cities suffered from
                                                very poor air quality. Smogs, which are a mixture of winter fog and smoke, were
                                                frequent occurrences.
                                                These smogs contained high levels of sulphur dioxide and smoke particles, both of
                                                which are harmful to humans. In December 1952, a period of windless conditions
                                                prevailed, resulting in a smog in London that lasted for five days. Apart from very
                                                poor visibility, it was estimated at the time that this smog contributed to some
                                                4000 premature deaths and another 100 000 people suffered smog-related
                                                illnesses. With improved scientific research, it is now suspected that these figures
                                                were seriously underestimated and as many as 12 000 people may have died.
                                                Not surprisingly, there was a massive public outcry, which led to the government
                                                introducing the Clean Air Act 1956 and local authorities declaring areas as
                                                ‘smoke-control areas’.
                                                The Clean Air Act of 1956 was replaced in 1993. Under this act, it is an offence to
                                                sell or burn an unauthorised fuel in a smoke-control area unless it is burned in

            Check with the local planning authority with regards to both internal work and

            If the project includes the construction of buildings for the storage of biofuels or
            to house the boiler, then the same planning requirements as for extensions and

                                             The advantages and disadvantages of biomass fuels
                                             The advantages of biomass fuels are that:
                                             ●   they are carbon neutral
                                             ●   they are a sustainable fuel source
                                             ●   when biomass fuels are burned, the waste gases are low in nitrous oxide, with
                                                 no sulphur dioxide – both are greenhouse gases.
                                             The disadvantages of biomass fuels are that:
                                             ●   transportation costs are high; wood pellets or wood chips will need to be
                                                 delivered in bulk to make delivery costs viable
                                             ●   storage space is needed for the fuel; as woody biomass has a low calorific
                                                 value, a large quantity of fuel will be required
                                             ●   consideration must be given as to whether or not adequate storage space is
                                                 available
                                             ●   when a solid fuel is burned, it is not possible to have instant control of heat,
                                                 as would be the case with a gas boiler; the fuel source cannot be instantly
                                                 removed to stop combustion
                                             ●   they require a suitable flue system.

              KEY TERM                       discussed in this section:
              Micro-renewable energy:

                                                 with the grid-supplied electricity.
                                             ●   With an off-grid connection, the system is not connected to the grid but
                                                 supplies electricity directly to current-using equipment or is used to charge
                                                 batteries and then supplies electrical equipment via an inverter.
                                             The batteries required for off-grid systems need to be deep-cycle type batteries,
                                             which are expensive to purchase. The other downside of using batteries to store
                                             electricity is that their lifespan may be as short as five years, after which the
                                             battery bank will need replacing.
                                             With on-grid systems, any excess electricity generated is exported back to the
                                             grid. At times when the generation output is not sufficient to meet the demand,
                                             electricity is imported from the grid.

            Solar photovoltaic
            Solar photovoltaic (PV) is the conversion of light into electricity. Light is
            electromagnetic energy and, in the case of visible light, is electromagnetic energy
            that is visible to the human eye. The electromagnetic energy released by the Sun
            consists of a wide spectrum, most of which is not visible to the human eye and
            cannot be converted into electricity by PV modules.

            Working principles
            The basic element of photovoltaic energy production is the PV cell, which is
            made from semiconductor material. While various semiconductor materials can
            be used in the making of PV cells, the most common material is silicon. Adding
                                                                                                   KEY TERMS

            semiconductor material together creates a p-n junction. This forms the basis of all    Photons: Particles of
            semiconductors used in electronics.                                                    energy from the Sun.
            When photons hit the surface of the PV cell, they are absorbed by the p-type
            semiconductor material. The additional energy provided by these photons
            allows electrons to overcome the bonds holding them and to move within the
            semiconductor material, thus creating a potential difference or – in other words –
            generating a voltage.
            Photovoltaic cells have an output voltage of 0.5 V, so a number of these cells are
            linked together to form modules with resulting higher voltage and power outputs.
            Modules are connected in series to increase voltage. These are known as ‘strings’.
            All the modules together are known as an ‘array’. An array therefore can comprise
            a single string or multiple strings. The connection arrangements are determined
            by the size of the system and the choice of inverter. It should be noted that PV
            arrays can attain DC voltages of many hundreds of volts.

            ●    Amorphous film ranges in efficiency from 5% to 7%. Amorphous film is
                 low efficiency but is flexible, so it can be formed into curves and is ideal for
                 surfaces that are not flat.
            While efficiencies may appear low, the maximum theoretical efficiency that can
            be obtained with a single junction silicon cell is only 34%.

            PV module mounting system
            Photovoltaic modules can be fitted as in-roof systems, on-roof systems, ground-
            mounted systems or pole-mounted systems.
            In in-roof systems the modules replace the roof tiles. The modules used are
            specially designed to interlock, to ensure that the roof structure is watertight. The
            modules are fixed directly to the roof structure. Several different
            systems are on the market, from single tile size to large panels that
            replace a whole section of roof tiles. In-roof systems cost more
            than on-roof systems but are more aesthetically pleasing. In-roof
            systems are generally only suitable for new-build projects or where
            the roof is to be retiled.
            On-roof systems are the common method employed for retrofit
            systems. Various different mounting systems exist for securing
            the modules to the roof structure. Most consist of aluminium
            rails, which are fixed to the roof structure by means of roof hooks.
            Mounting systems also exist for fitting PV modules to flat roofs.
            Checks will need to be made to ensure that the existing roof
            structure can withstand the additional weight and also the uplift          Figure 1.24 In-roof mounted system

                                                   installed. In the UK, all calculations are based on 1000 Wp (watts peak) of the
                                                   Sun’s radiation on 1 m2. So, if the array uses modules with a 15% efficiency,

            in the UK is between 30° and 40°. However, the modules will

            more electricity than one in Newcastle, purely because
            Brighton receives more sunshine.

            The suitability of the structure for mounting the solar collector
            The structure must be assessed for its suitability for mounting the chosen solar
            collector. Consideration needs to be given to the strength of the structure, the
            suitability of fixings and the condition of the structure. Consideration also needs
            to be given to the effect known as ‘wind uplift’, an upward force exerted by the
            wind on the module and mounting system. The PV array fixings and the fixings
            holding the roof members to the building structure must be strong enough to
            allow for wind uplift.
            In the case of roof-mounted systems on blocks of flats and other shared
            properties, consideration must also be given to the ownership of the structure on
            which the proposed system is to be installed.

            A suitable place to mount the inverter
            The inverter is usually mounted either in the loft space or at the mains position.

            Connection to the grid
            A spare way within the consumer unit will need to be available for connection of
            the PV system. If a spare way is not available, then the consumer unit may need
            to be changed.

                                                 Permitted development applies where a PV system is installed:
                                                 ●   on a dwelling house or block of flats
                                                 ●   on a building within the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats
                                                 ●   as a stand-alone system in the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats.
                                                 However, there are criteria to be met in each case.
                                                 For building-mounted systems:
                                                 ●   the PV system must not protrude more than 200 mm from the wall or the
             Figure 1.29 Building features          roof slope
              shading a photovoltaic system      ●   the PV system must not protrude past the highest point of the roof (the ridge
                                                     line), excluding the chimney.
                                                 For stand-alone systems:
                                                 ●   only one stand-alone system is allowed in the grounds
                                                 ●   the array must not exceed 4 m in height
                                                 ●   the array must not be installed within 5 m of the boundary of the grounds
                                                 ●   the array must not exceed 9 m2 in area
                                                 ●   no dimension of the array may exceed 3 m in length.
                                                 For both building-mounted and stand-alone systems, the following criteria must
                                                 be met.
                                                 ●   The system must not be installed in the grounds, or on a building within the
                                                     grounds, of a listed building or a scheduled monument.
                                                 ●   If the dwelling is in a conservation area or a World Heritage Site, then the
                                                     array must not be closer to a highway than the house or block of flats.
                                                 In every other case, planning permission will be required.

            Other regulatory requirements to consider
            Other regulatory requirements to consider regarding the installation of solar PV
            systems are:
            ●    BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition, including
                 amendments
            ●    G98 requirements in relation to on-grid systems up to and including 16 A per
                 phase; above this size, the requirements of G99 will need to be complied with
            ●    Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) requirements.

            The advantages and disadvantages of solar
            photovoltaic systems
            The advantages of solar PV systems are that:
            ●    they can be fitted to most buildings
            ●    excess electricity can be sold back to the distribution network operator
            ●    there is a reduction in the amount of electricity imported
            ●    they use zero-carbon technology
            ●    they improve energy performance certificate ratings
            ●    there is a reasonable payback period on the initial investment.
            The disadvantages of solar PV systems are described below.
            ●    The initial cost is high.
            ●    The size of the system is dependent on available, suitable roof area.
            ●    They require a relatively large array to offset installation costs.
            ●    They give variable output that is dependent on the amount of sunshine
                 available. Lowest output is at times of greatest requirement, such as at night
                 and in the winter. Savings need to be considered over the whole year.
            ●    There is an aesthetic impact (on the appearance of the building).

            Micro-wind
            Wind turbines harness energy from the wind and turn it into electricity. The UK
            is an ideal location for the installation of wind turbines as about 40% of Europe’s
            wind energy passes over the UK. A micro-wind turbine installed on a suitable site
            could easily generate more power than would be consumed on site.

            Working principles
            A wind turbine operates as follows.
            ●    Wind passing the rotor blades of the turbine causes the turbine to turn.
            ●    The hub of the turbine is connected by a low-speed shaft to a gearbox.
            ●    The gearbox output is connected to a high-speed shaft that drives a generator
                 which, in turn, produces electricity.
            Turbines are available as either horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) or vertical-
            axis wind turbines (VAWTs). A HAWT has a tailfin to turn the turbine so that it is

            With off-grid systems, the output from the controller is used to charge batteries
            so that the output can be stored for when it is needed. The output from the
            batteries then feeds an inverter so that 230 V AC equipment can be connected.

            Location and building requirements
            Several factors need to be taken into account when considering whether or not a
            location is suitable for the installation of a micro-wind turbine. These include:
            ●    the average wind speed on the site
            ●    obstructions and turbulence
            ●    the height at which the turbine can be mounted
            ●    turbine noise
            ●    turbine vibration
            ●    shadow flicker.

            second (m/s), is a prime consideration when deciding on a location’s suitability for
            the installation of a micro-wind turbine. Wind speed needs to be a minimum of
            5 m/s for a wind turbine to generate electricity. Manufacturers of wind turbines
            provide power curves for their turbines, which show the output of a turbine at
            different wind speeds. Most micro-wind turbines will achieve their maximum
            output when the wind speed is about 10 m/s.

            Obstructions and turbulence
            For a wind turbine to work efficiently, a smooth flow of air needs to pass across
            the turbine blades. The ideal location for a wind turbine would be at the top of a
            gentle slope. As the wind passes up the slope it gains speed, resulting in a higher
            output from the turbine.

                                             The wind passing over the turbine blades is disturbed and thus the efficiency is
                                             reduced.

            Where an obstacle lies upwind of the turbine, the bottom edge of the blade
            should be above the height of the obstacle.

            Turbine noise
            The wind turbine will generate noise when in use,
            so consideration needs to be given to buildings
            sited close to the wind turbine.

            Turbine vibration
            Consideration needs to be given to vibration if the
            wind turbine is to be mounted on a building. It
            may be necessary to consult a structural engineer.

            Shadow flicker
            Shadow flicker is the result of the rotating blades
            of a turbine passing between a viewer and the
            Sun. It is important to ensure that shadow flicker
            does not unduly affect a building sited in the
            shadow-flicker zone of the wind turbine.
            The distance of the shadow-flicker zone from the
            turbine will be at its greatest when the Sun is at        Figure 1.37 The area affected by shadow flicker

            Planning permission
            While permitted development exists for the installation of wind turbines, it is
            severely restricted so, for the majority of installations, a planning application will
            be required.
            Permitted development applies where a wind turbine is installed:
            ●    on a detached dwelling house
            ●    on a detached building within the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats
            ●    as a stand-alone system in the grounds of a dwelling house or block of flats.
            It is important to note that permitted development for building-mounted wind
            turbines only applies to detached premises. It does not apply to semi-detached
            houses or flats.
            Even with detached premises or stand-alone turbines there are criteria to be met.
            ●    The wind turbine must comply with the Microgeneration Certification Scheme
                 (MCS) planning standards or equivalent.
            ●    Only one wind turbine may be installed on the building or within the grounds
                 of the building.
            ●    An air-source heat pump may not be installed on the building or within the
                 grounds of the building.

            Micro-hydro
            All rivers flow downhill. This movement of water from a higher level to a lower
            level is a source of free kinetic energy that hydro-electric generation harnesses.

            installation work involved with the turbines and generators, there is also a large
            amount of civil engineering and construction work to be carried out to route the
            water to where it is needed.
            The main components of the water course construction are:
            ●    intake, which is the point where a portion of the river’s water is diverted from
                 the main stream
            ●    the canal that connects the intake to the forebay
            ●    the forebay, which holds a reservoir of water that ensures that the penstock is
                 pressurised at all times and allows surges in demand to be catered for
            ●    the penstock, which is pipework taking water from the forebay to the turbines
            ●    the powerhouse, which is the building housing the turbine and the generator
            ●    the tailrace, which is the outlet that takes the water exiting the turbines and
                 returns it to the main stream of the river.

            Impulse turbines
            In impulse turbines, the turbine wheel or runner operates in air, with water
            jets driving the runner. The water from the penstock is focused on the
            blades by means of a nozzle. The velocity of the water is increased but the
            water pressure remains the same, so there is no requirement to enclose the
            runner in a pressure casing. Impulse turbines are used with high-head water
            sources. Examples of impulse turbines are given below.
            The Pelton turbine consists of a wheel with bucket-type vanes set around
            the rim. The water jet hits the vane and turns the runner. The water gives
            up most of its energy and falls into a discharge channel below. A multi-jet
            Pelton turbine is also available. A Pelton turbine is used with medium or
            high-head water sources.                                                            Figure 1.40 Impulse turbine
            The Turgo turbine is similar to the Pelton but the water jet is designed
            to hit the runner at an angle and from one side of the turbine. The water enters
            at one side of the runner and exits at the other, allowing the Turgo turbine to be
            smaller than the Pelton for the same power output. This type of turbine is used
            with water sources with medium or high heads of water.

            With the cross-flow or Banki type of turbine, the runner consists of two end-
            plates with slats, set at an angle, joining the two discs – much like a water wheel.
            Water passes through the slats, turning the runner and then exiting from below.
            This type of turbine is used with water sources with low or medium heads of
            water.

                                             In a reaction turbine, the runners are fully immersed in the water and enclosed in
                                             a pressure casing. Water passes through the turbine, causing the runner blades to
                                             turn or react.
                                             Examples of reaction turbines are described below.
                                             In a Francis wheel turbine, water enters the turbine housing and passes through
                                             the runner, causing it to turn. This type of turbine is used with water sources with

            Kaplan (or propeller) turbines work like a
            boat propeller in reverse. Water passing the
            angled blades turns the runner. This type of
            turbine is used with water sources with low
            heads of water.
            The Archimedes’ screw consists of a helical
            screw thread, which was originally designed
            so that turning the screw – usually by
            hand – would draw water up the thread
            to a higher level. In the case of hydro-
            electric turbines, a reverse Archimedes’
            screw is used: water flows down the screw,
            hence reverse, turning the screw, which is
            connected to the generator. This type of
            turbine is particularly suited to low-head
            operations but its major feature is that, due
            to its design, it is ‘fish-friendly’ and fish are
            able to pass through it. For this reason, the
            reverse Archimedes’ screw may be the only            Figure 1.46 Kaplan or propeller turbine
            option if a hydro-electric generator is to
            be fitted on a river that is environmentally
            sensitive.

            Location and building requirements
            The following factors should be taken into account when considering the
            installation of a micro-hydro turbine.
            The location will require a suitable water source with:
            ●    a minimum head of 1.5 m
            ●    a minimum flow rate of 100 litres/second.

                                                 The water source should not be subject to seasonal variation that will take the
                                                 water supply outside of the above parameters.
                                                 The location has to be suitable, to allow for construction of:
                                                 ●   the water inlet

            Other regulatory requirements to consider
            Other regulatory requirements to consider regarding the installation of micro-
            hydro systems are:
            ●    BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition, including
                 amendments
            ●    G98 Requirements for Grid-tied Systems
            ●    Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MSC) requirements
            ●    Environment Agency requirements.
            In England and Wales, all waterways are controlled by the Environment Agency.
            To remove water from these waterways, even though it may be returned – as in
            the case of a hydro-electric system – will usually require permission and a licence.
            There are three types of licence that may apply to a hydro-electric system.
            ●    An abstraction licence will be required if water is diverted away from the
                 main water course. The major concern will be the impact that the project has
                 on fish migration, as most turbines are not fish-friendly. This requirement may
                 affect the choice of turbine (see reverse Archimedes’ screw, page 41). It may
                 mean that fish screens are necessary over water inlets or, where the turbine is
                 in the main channel of water, a fish pass around the turbine may need to be
                 constructed.
            ●    An impoundment is any construction that changes the flow of water. An
                 impoundment licence will be required if changes or additions are made to
                 sluices, weirs and so on that control the flow within the main stream of water.
            ●    A land drainage licence will be required for any changes made to the main
                 channel of water.
            An environment site audit (ESA) will be required as part of the initial assessment
            process. An ESA covers:
            ●    water resources
            ●    conservation
            ●    chemical and physical water quality
            ●    biological water quality
            ●    fisheries
            ●    managing flood risk
            ●    navigation of the waterway.

            The advantages and disadvantages
            of micro-hydro systems
            The advantages of micro-hydro systems are that:
            ●    there are no on-site carbon emissions
            ●    large amounts of electricity are output, usually more than required for a single
                 dwelling; the surplus can be sold
            ●    there is a reasonable payback period
            ●    they are excellent systems where no mains electricity exists
            ●    they are not dependent on weather conditions or building orientation.

                                           The disadvantages of micro-hydro systems are that:
                                           ●    a high head or fast flow of water is required on the property
                                           ●    planning permission is required, which can be onerous
                                           ●    permission from the Environment Agency is required for water extraction
                                           ●    strengthening of the grid may be required for grid-tied systems
                                           ●    initial costs are high.

                                           AND POWER
                                           In micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) technologies, also referred to as
                                           co-generation energy technologies, a fuel source is used to satisfy the demand
                                           for heat but, at the same time, generates electricity that can either be used
                                           or sold back to the supplier. Currently, mCHP units used in domestic dwellings
                                           are powered by means of natural gas or liquid propane gas (LPG), but could be
                                           fuelled by using biomass fuels. Figure 1.48 represents, from left to right, an old,

                                           With the old, inefficient gas boiler, 65% of the input energy is used to provide
                                           heating for the premises; 35% is lost up the flue. With the modern condensing
                                           boiler, this lost heat is reused so that the output to the heating is 95%. The mCHP
                                           unit will achieve the same efficiencies as the modern condensing boiler but 80%
                                           of the input is used to provide heat and 15% is used to power a generator.

                 VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS
                 Reducing the cost as well as the environmental impact of any installation is
                 important.
                 There are obvious savings to be made in replacing an old, inefficient boiler
                 with an mCHP unit.
                 On a unit-by-unit comparison, gas is cheaper than electricity, so any
                 electricity generated by using gas means a proportionally greater financial
                 saving over using electricity.


            In addition to this saving, locally generated power reduces transmission losses,
            and consequently creates less CO2, than if the electricity were generated at a
            power station some distance away.
            This type of generation, using an mCHP unit, is known as ‘heat-led’; the primary
            function of the unit is to provide space heating, while the generation of electricity
            is secondary. The more heat that is produced, the more electricity is generated.
            The unit only generates electricity when there is a demand for heating. Most
            domestic mCHP units will generate between 1 kW and 1.5 kW of electricity.
            Micro-combined heat and power is a carbon-reduction technology rather than a
            carbon-free technology.

                                                     INDUSTRY TIP
                Carbon-reduction technologies (CRTs) are technologies that reduce but do not eliminate
                the need for a fuel source. They can include combined heat and power systems, which use
                fuel more efficiently than conventional boilers or power generators. In contrast, carbon-
                free technologies use natural resources, such as wind. Carbon-reduction technologies
                also include low-energy, current-using equipment, such as LED lighting, because these
                technologies reduce the need for electricity, thus reducing carbon.


            Combined heat and power (CHP) units have been available for some years but it
            is only recently that domestic versions have become available. Domestic versions
            are usually gas-fired and use a Stirling engine to produce electricity, though other
            fuel sources, and types of generator combinations, are available.
            The key components of an mCHP unit are:
            ●    an engine burner
            ●    a Stirling engine generator
            ●    a supplementary burner
            ●    a heat exchanger.
            When there is demand for heat, the engine burner works to:
            ●    fire and start the Stirling engine generator
            ●    produce about 25% of the full heat output of the unit

                                                  ●   When the engine burner fires, the helium expands, forcing the piston downwards.
                                                  ●   The return water from the heating system passing across the engine cools the
                                                      gas, causing it to contract.
                                                  ●   A spring arrangement within the engine returns the piston to the top of the
                                                      cylinder and the process starts all over again.
                                                  ●   The piston is used to drive a magnet up and down between coils of wire,
                                                      generating an electromotive force (emf) in the coils.

                                                  Connection of the mCHP unit to the supply
                                                  The preferred method for connecting an mCHP unit to the supply is via a
                                                  dedicated circuit directly from the consumer unit. This method allows for easy
                                                  isolation of the generator from the incoming supply.

                                                  Location and building requirements
                                                  For mCHP to be viable, the building should have a high demand for space heating.
                                                  The larger the property, the greater the carbon savings. A building that is well
                                                  insulated will not usually be suitable for mCHP, because a well-insulated building
                                                  is unlikely to have a high demand for space heating.

            If an mCHP unit is fitted to a building that is either too small or well insulated, the
            demand for heat will be low and the mCHP unit will cycle on and off, resulting in
            inefficient operation.

            Planning permission
            Planning permission will not normally be required for the installation of an
            mCHP unit in a domestic dwelling if the entire work is confined to the inside of
            the building. If the installation requires an external flue to be installed, this will
            normally be classed as permitted development as long as the flue to the rear or
            side elevation does not extend more than 1 m above the highest part of the roof.

            Listed buildings or buildings in a designated area
            Check with the local planning authority regarding both internal work and external
            flues.

            Buildings in a conservation area or in a World
            Heritage Site
            Flues should not be fitted on the principal or side elevation if they would be visible
            from a highway.
            If the project includes the construction of buildings for fuel storage or to house
            the mCHP unit, then the same planning requirements will apply as for extensions
            and garden outbuildings.

            Compliance with Building Regulations
            The Building Regulations applicable to the installation of micro-combined heat

                                           ●   gas regulations will apply to the installation
                                           ●   the gas installation work will need to be carried out by an operative registered

                                           The advantages of mCHP systems are that:
                                           ●   the ability to generate electricity is not dependent on building direction or
                                               weather conditions
                                           ●   the system generates electricity while there is demand for heat
                                           ●   they save carbon over centrally generated electricity
                                           ●   they reduce the building’s carbon footprint.
                                           The disadvantages of mCHP systems are that:
                                           ●   the initial cost is high compared with an efficient gas boiler
                                           ●   they are unsuitable for properties with low demand for heat – small or very
                                               well-insulated properties
                                           ●   there is limited capacity for the generation of electricity.

                VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS
                Even in the UK, clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With growing demand,
                the pressure on this vital resource is increasing. Water conservation is one
                way of ensuring that demand does not outstrip supply.


            The two methods of water conservation covered in this chapter are:
            ●    rainwater harvesting
            ●    reuse of greywater.
            Water conservation is one way of reducing the cost of water bills. Whether
            a water bill is based on the amount of water used (metered) or a fixed rate
            (unmeasured), it will contain two charges:
            ● charges for fresh water supplied

            ● charges for sewage or waste water taken away.

            The amount of water taken away, which includes surface water (rainwater), is
            assumed to be 95% of the water supplied.

              HEALTH AND SAFETY
                                                 Rainwater can be captured from roofs or hard standings. In the case of roofs, the
              Water collected from
              roofs covered in asbestos,         water is captured by means of gutters and flows to the water-harvesting tank via
              copper, lead or bitumen            the property’s rainwater downpipes. The amount of water that can be collected

              faecal matter.                     Filtration
                                                 As the rainwater passes from the rainwater-capture system to the storage tanks, it
                                                 passes through an in-line filter to remove debris, such as leaves. The efficiency of
                                                 this filter will determine how much of the captured water ends up in the storage
                                                 tank. Manufacturers usually quote figures in excess of 90% efficiency.

                                                 Storage of rainwater
                                                 Rainwater storage tanks can be either above-ground or below-ground types
                                                 and can vary in size, from a small tank next to a house, to a buried tank that is
                                                 able to hold many thousands of litres of water. Below-ground tanks will require
                                                 excavation works, while above-ground tanks will need a suitably sized space to
                                                 accommodate them. Whichever type of tank is used, it will need to be protected
                                                 against frost, heat from direct sunlight and contamination.
                                                 The size of the tank will be determined by the rainwater available and the annual
                                                 demand. It is common practice to base the size of a tank on 5% of the annual
                                                 rainwater supply or the anticipated annual demand. A submersible pump is used
                                                 to transport water from the storage tank to the point of demand.
                                                 The tank will incorporate an overflow pipe connected to the drainage system of
                                                 the property, for times when the harvested rainwater exceeds the capacity of the
                                                 storage tank.

            Reuse of stored rainwater
            Two system options are available for the reuse of rainwater that is collected and
            stored: indirect and direct distribution.
            With indirect distribution systems, water is pumped from the storage tank to a
            supplementary storage tank or header tank located within the premises. This, in
            turn, feeds the water outlets via pipework separated from the wholesome water
            supply pipes.

                                           The header tank will incorporate a backflow prevention air gap to meet the Water
                                           Regulations. The arrangement of water control and overflow pipes will ensure that
                                           the air gap is maintained. The rainwater level control connects to a control unit
                                           that operates the submersible pump, so that water is drawn from the main storage
                                           tank when required. At times when there is not enough rainwater to meet the
                                           demand, fresh water is introduced into the system via the wholesome water inlet,
                                           which is controlled by means of the wholesome water level control.
                                           In direct distribution systems, the control unit pumps rainwater directly to the
                                           outlets on demand. At times of low rainwater availability, the control unit will
                                           provide water from the wholesome supply to the outlets. The backflow prevention
                                           methods to meet the requirements of the Water Regulations will be incorporated
                                           into the control unit. This type of system uses more energy than the indirect
                                           distribution system.

            Planning permission
            In principle, planning permission is not normally required for the installation of
            a rainwater-harvesting system if it does not alter the outside appearance of the
            property. It is, however, always worth enquiring with the local authority, especially
            if the system is installed above ground, if the building is in a designated area or if
            the building is listed.

            Compliance with Building Regulations
            The Building Regulations applicable to the installation of rainwater-harvesting
            systems are outlined in Table 1.11.
             Table 1.11 Building Regulations applicable to rainwater-harvesting systems

              P         Electrical safety                       The installation of electrical controls and components must be considered.


            Other regulatory requirements to consider
            The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 apply to rainwater-harvesting
            systems. The key area of concern will be the avoidance of cross-contamination
            between rainwater and wholesome water. This is known as ‘backflow prevention’
            and, as rainwater is classified as a category 5 risk, the usual method of backflow
            prevention is through use of a type AA air gap between the wholesome water and                          Rain Water
            the rainwater.
            Any pipework used to supply outlets with rainwater will need to be labelled to
            distinguish it from pipework for wholesome water. Outlets will also need to be
            labelled to indicate that the water supplied is not suitable for drinking.

                                                       The disadvantages of rainwater-harvesting systems are that:
                                                       ●   the quantity of available water is limited by roof area, and demand for water
                                                           may not be met during dry periods
                                                       ●   initial costs are high
                                                       ●   a water meter should be fitted.

                                                       Greywater gets its name from its cloudy, grey appearance. Capturing and

            ●    washing dishes
            ●    washing and preparing food
            ●    personal hygiene – washing, bathing or showering.

            Working principles
            Several types of greywater reuse system exist but, apart from the direct reuse
            system, they all have similar common features. These are:
            ●    a tank for storing the treated water
            ●    a pump
            ●    a distribution system for moving the water from storage to where it is to be
                 used
            ●    some form of treatment.

            Direct reuse system
            With a direct reuse system, greywater is collected from appliances and reused
            without treatment or storage. The greywater can be used for such tasks as
            watering the garden; even so, it is not considered suitable for watering fruit or
            vegetable crops.

            Short-retention system
            With a short-retention system, greywater from baths and showers is collected in a
            cleaning tank. Here, the greywater is treated, by means such as surface skimming,
            to remove debris, such as soap, hair and foam. Heavier particles settle to the
            bottom of the tank, where they are flushed away as waste. The remaining water is
            then transferred to a storage tank, ready for use.
            The storage tank is usually relatively small, at around 100 litres, which is enough
            for 18–20 toilet flushes. If the water is not used within a short time, generally 24
            hours, the stored greywater is purged, the system is cleaned and a small amount
            of fresh water is introduced to allow toilet flushing. This avoids the greywater
            deteriorating and beginning to smell at times when the premises are unoccupied
            for a long period of time.
            A short-retention system can result in water savings of 30%. It is ideal for
            installation in a new-build project but is more difficult to retrofit. The system is
            usually fitted in the same room as the source of the greywater.

                                           Physical and chemical system
                                           A physical and chemical system uses a filter to remove debris from the collected
                                           water (physical cleaning). After the greywater has been filtered, chemical
                                           disinfectants, such as chlorine or bromine, are added to inhibit the growth of
                                           bacteria during storage.

                                           Biomechanical system
                                           This type of system is the most advanced of the greywater reuse systems, using
                                           both biological and physical methods to treat the collected greywater. It has an
                                           indoor unit, about the size of a large refrigerator. The treatment process is as
                                           follows.
                                           ●   Greywater enters the system and passes through a filtering unit where
                                               particles, such as hair and textiles debris, are filtered out. The filtering unit is
                                               electronically controlled to provide automatic flushing of the filter.
                                           ●   Water enters a main recycling chamber, where organic matter is decomposed
                                               by biocultures.
                                           ●   The water remains in this chamber for three hours before being pumped to the
                                               secondary recycling chamber for further biological treatment.
                                           ●   Biological sediment settles to the bottom of each chamber, where it is sucked
                                               out and transferred to a drain.
                                           ●   After a further three hours, the water passes through a UV filter to a final
                                               storage chamber, where it is ready for use.
                                           ●   When there is demand for the treated water, this is pumped to the point of
                                               demand.
                                           ●   At times when the availability of treated water is low, fresh water can be
                                               introduced to the system in the final chamber.
                                           Water from this unit can be used for washing clothes as well as for the other tasks
                                           previously stated.

                                           Location and building requirements
                                           The following factors should be taken into account when considering the
                                           installation of a greywater reuse system.
                                           ●   There needs to be a suitable supply of greywater to meet the demand.
                                               Premises with a low volume of greywater are not suitable for a greywater reuse
                                               system.
                                           ●   Suitability of the location and the availability of space to store enough
                                               greywater to meet the demand of the premises must be assessed.
                                           ●   Storage tanks need to be located away from heat, including direct sunlight, to
                                               avoid the growth of algae. They need to be located so that they are not liable
                                               to freezing in cold weather.
                                           ●   There needs to be a wholesome water supply.
                                           ●   Where greywater tanks are retrofitted, access for excavation equipment will
                                               need to be considered.
                                           ●   A water meter will need to be fitted on the water supply to maximise the
                                               benefits.

            Planning permission
            In principle, planning permission is not normally required for the installation
            of a greywater reuse system if it does not alter the outside appearance of the
            property. It is, however, always worth enquiring with the local authority, especially
            if the system is installed above ground, if the building is in a designated area or if
            the building is listed.
            If a building is required to house the greywater storage system, then a planning
            application will need to be submitted.

            Compliance with Building Regulations
            The Building Regulations applicable to the installation of greywater reuse systems
            are outlined in Table 1.12.

             Table 1.12 Building Regulations applicable to greywater reuse systems

              Part      Title                                   Relevance

              P         Electrical safety                       The installation of electrical controls and components must be considered.


            Other regulatory requirements to consider
            The Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999 apply to greywater
            recycling installations. The key area of concern will be the avoidance of cross-
            contamination between greywater and wholesome water. This is known as
            ‘backflow prevention’ and, as greywater is classified as a category 5 risk, the
            usual method of providing backflow prevention is with an air gap between the
            wholesome water and the greywater.
            Any pipework used to supply outlets with the treated greywater will need to be
            labelled to distinguish it from pipework for wholesome water. Outlets will need
            to be clearly identified by means such as labelling. Outlets will also need to be
            labelled to indicate that the water supplied is not suitable for drinking.
            There are other regulatory requirements to consider regarding the installation of
            greywater reuse systems.

                                           ●   The local water authority must be notified when a greywater reuse system is
                                               to be installed.
                                           ●   BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition, including
                                               amendments, will apply to the installation of supplies and control systems for
                                               the greywater reuse system.


                                           The advantages and disadvantages of
                                           greywater reuse systems
                                           The advantages of greywater reuse systems are that:
                                           ●   the cost of water bills will reduce if the supply is metered
                                           ●   they reduce demands on the wholesome water supply
                                           ●   a wide range of system options exists
                                           ●   they have the potential to provide more reusable water than rainwater-
                                               harvesting systems.
                                           The disadvantages of greywater reuse systems are that:
                                           ●   there are long payback periods
                                           ●   they can be difficult to integrate into an existing system
                                           ●   only certain types of appliance or outlet can be connected; this causes
                                               additional plumbing work
                                           ●   cross-contamination can be a problem
                                           ●   a water meter will need to be fitted to achieve maximum financial gains
                                           ●   the need for filtering and pumping may increase rather than decrease the
                                               carbon footprint.

            ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES



               INTRODUCTION
               Scientific principles underpin all technical subjects in electrical installation work. Without a basic understanding
               of the science, it is not possible to understand how systems and equipment function and protect. A skilled
               electrician needs to understand the dangers electricity can create in all situations. They are only able to do
               that by knowing the science and principles behind electricity, electrical systems, materials, equipment and
               components.

            POWER GENERATION
            AND SUPPLY
            The privatised power system
            Upon privatisation in 1990, the 12 regional English electricity boards were turned
            into 12 separate companies, with the intention of them buying their electricity
            wholesale, at market rates, and mainly from the three concerns that produced
            the electricity: National Power and Powergen, which took over the CEGB’s big
            coal-fired power stations in 1991, and British Energy, owner of the newest nuclear
            stations. The transportation of electricity between power stations and from region
            to region, was carried out by National Grid, owned jointly at first by the 12 local
            electricity firms and then, after 1996, as an independent commercial enterprise.
            However, in addition to the large generating stations connected to the
            transmission system, an increasing number of small electricity generating plants
            are connected throughout the distribution networks rather than the transmission
            system. Generation connected to the distribution network, which is owned by
            the distribution network operators (DNOs), is called distributed generation (DG).
            This results in power flowing from both the distribution network to customers and
            from customers with DG into the distribution network.

            A three-phase AC generator has a stator with three sets of windings arranged so
            that there is a phase displacement of 120°. The three-phase output is produced by
            either star- or delta-connected windings on the stator.

            How AC generators work
            For simplicity, the description below relates to one phase. However, it is important
            to remember that there are three phases, displaced at 120° from each other.
            As each pair of poles passes through the strongest part of the magnetic field at
            right angles, the maximum electromotive force (emf) is induced into that

            back to zero.

            The time taken for the cycle to return to its starting position (from position 1 back

                                           A growing proportion of the UK’s electricity is already generated from renewable
                                           sources but, with concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, this is expected to

            Source and arrangements of supply
            As was discussed earlier, a number of different electricity supply systems may be
            used in work premises, catering for specific requirements. These may be DC or AC
            operating at different voltages, and in the case of AC the supply may be single- or
            three-phase.
            Direct current is not used for public electricity supplies (with the exception of the
            links between England, the Netherlands, Ireland and France) but has some work
            applications, e.g. battery-operated works plant (fork lift trucks, etc.). Certain parts
            of the UK railway system, in particular the London Underground and services in
            Southern England, also use DC for traction supplies.
            DC battery systems are becoming more common as storage solutions for
            installations. These are of particular use where added demand, such as those of
            electric vehicle charging points, are added to installations. The introduction of
            Approved Document S means that many new houses will require a vehicle charging
            point to be installed. If these are used regularly, the added burden on the supply
            could be damaging so storage systems may be needed to help with demand.
            Alternating current is the distribution system of choice for electricity suppliers
            all over the world. The main reason is its versatility. Using an AC supply permits
            wider scope concerning circuit arrangements and supply voltages, through the use
            of transformers, which enables the supply voltage to be changed up or down.
            These different types of AC supply systems will now be explained.

            As with DC, the simplest AC supply arrangement is a two-wire system, known as
            a single-phase supply. This is the arrangement provided for domestic premises, as            In very rare circumstances an

            In a balanced three-phase system there is no need to have a star-point connection
            to neutral as the current drawn by any one phase is taken out equally by the other
            two. Therefore the star point is naturally at zero.

                                               Neutral current in three-phase and neutral supplies
                                               In a balanced three-phase system there is no requirement to have a star-point
                                               connection as the three phases have a cancellation effect on each other. Therefore
                                               the star point is naturally at zero current. While the load is balanced and the
                                               waveforms are symmetrical (not containing harmonics or other waveform
                                               distorting influences), this statement is relatively accurate. However, in practice,
                                               this is sometimes not the case.
                                               Where the load is not in balance, different currents circulate in the load through
                                               the source winding and back. This gives rise to a change in star-point voltage,
                                               which can result in the system ‘floating’ away from its earthed reference point.
                                               In essence, a current will flow in the neutral. The three ways in which this current
                                               value could be determined are:
                                               ●   by phasor, an accurate method that indicates the angle at which the maximum
                                                   current occurs
                                               ●   by calculation, which gives an accurate value
                                               ●   by equilateral triangle, which gives a good indication of the value.

                                               Three-phase AC supply (delta connected)
                                               In a delta-connected system, each of the three coil windings is wound in such
                                               a way that each winding has a start and finish and the start of each winding
                                               is connected to the finish of the other winding. This gives a triangle or delta
                                               configuration. The supply is then taken from the interconnection of each winding,
                                               which means that a three-phase system can be obtained using only three wires.

            In a delta (Δ) connected load:
            ●     the line current (IL) flows through the cable supplying each load
            ●     the phase current (IP) is the current flowing through each load.

                                           The earthing system adopted will determine the earth fault loop impedance, and
                                           this will determine the method of protection against electric shock.

                                               higher than for TN systems and can be tens or hundreds of ohms. This means
                                               that residual current devices (RCDs) will need to be adopted for protection
                                               against electric shock as they operate at much lower earth fault currents than

            for small electrical appliances, to large step-up transformers that produce voltages
            of up to 400 kV for power transmission purposes. The wide range of sizes and
            capabilities corresponds to the everyday requirements of electricity usage.
            Although there are many different types and sizes of transformer, they all
            operate on the same principle. The basic principle is that in two independent
            coils (windings), a change in the magnetic flux of one coil can induce a magnetic
            change in the second coil. This is known as static inductance. It is further
            enhanced when the two electrically separated coils are wound onto a common
            magnetic core, which creates a common magnetic circuit.
            If an AC supply is applied to one coil (known as the primary), the magnetic flux
            produced by the first coil rotates and cuts through the second coil (known as the
            secondary), producing an emf in the secondary. This configuration works with AC
            or chopped DC. The field in the first coil rises and falls rapidly, causing inductance
            in the adjacent coil.

                                           Power transformers
                                           Power transformers are the most common type of transformer and are used as:
                                           ●   step-up transformers in the transmission of electrical energy from power
                                               stations (25 kV–400 kV) and step down from 400 kV to 132 kV
                                           ●   step-down transformers in distribution substations from 132 kV to 11 kV, and
                                               11 kV to 400 V for use in commercial and domestic situations
                                           ●   step-down transformers to convert mains voltage of 230 V to extra low
                                               voltage to power electronic equipment
                                           ●   one-to-one transformers where the input voltage is the same as the output
                                               voltage, such as a 230 V shaver point used in a bathroom which provides
                                               electric shock protection by electrical separation.
                                           The construction of insulated laminations minimises the eddy current produced
                                           during the transformation process.
                                           For large power transformers used at generating and distribution substations, oil
                                           is used as a coolant and insulating medium. For small rating transformers, the oil
                                           is circulated through ducts in the coil assembly and through cooling fins fixed to
                                           the body of the transformer tank or, in higher ratings, through separate air-cooled
                                           radiators that may use pumps and fans to aid the cooling process.
                                           Cast resin power transformers, where the windings are encased in epoxy resin, are
                                           often used where there is a fire risk in indoor situations.

                                           Current transformers
                                           Current transformers have many uses. Those that involve metering require
                                           extremely accurate current transformers, such as Class X CTs.
                                                                                                 Bus bar

            The AC flowing in the primary conductor produces a magnetic field in the core,
            which then induces a current in the secondary winding circuit.
            It is extremely important when positioning the current transformer to ensure that
            the primary and secondary circuits are efficiently coupled to give an accurate
            reading. It is also very important to ensure that the current transformer is always
            connected on the secondary side, either by a measuring instrument or a shorting link. If
            the current transformer is left open circuit, a large voltage discharge will occur.

            Isolation transformers
            Isolation transformers are available for step-up, step-down or straightforward 1:1
            isolation purposes. Their uses are quite diverse but ultimately they are intended to
            ensure electrical separation from the primary supply, usually for safety purposes.
            These transformers have additional insulation and electrostatic shielding. In some
            cases, one or both sides of the transformer remains separated from earth by a
            resistance or they have no connection at all.
            A common use for isolation transformers is the domestic shaver socket arrangement,
            which is isolated from earth to minimise any shock hazards from touching live parts.
            Because the parts are isolated and the current cannot flow back to its origin (the
            secondary side of the transformer) via the earth path, the shaver socket cannot
            deliver a shock under first-fault conditions. Isolation transformers are also used in
            many medical situations in order to prevent first-fault failures. These systems are also
            known as medical isolated power supplies (IPS).

                                           luminaires.

                                           Mutual inductance is where a primary winding induces a magnetic field that
                                           induces a current into a second winding, as in current and voltage transformers.


                                           Relationship of emf produced
                                           and number of turns
                                           The proportion of emf produced is related to the number of turns on the primary
                                           coil with respect to the secondary coil. This relationship can be determined by:
                                              E1       N1
                                                   =
                                              E2       N2

                                           where:
                                           E1 = emf induced in the primary (V1)
                                           E2 = emf induced in the secondary (V2)
                                           N1 = number of primary turns
                                           N2 = number of secondary turns.
                                           As power transformers have very low impedance, there is negligible error in
                                           assuming that the voltage on the primary is the same as the emf induced on the
                                           primary, and likewise for the voltage and emf on the secondary.

                                           A reasonable assumption is that:

                                              E1       V1
                                                   =
                                              E2       V2

                                           Therefore:
                                              V1       N1
                                                   =
                                              V2       N2

                                           The ratio of primary turns to secondary turns is referred to as the turns ratio,
                                           represented by:
                                              N1
                                              N2

                                           Current is also affected by the turns ratio of a transformer, but in reverse to
                                           voltage, so:
                                              V1       N1       I2

              EXAMPLE
              A transformer is wound with 560 turns on the primary and 20 turns on the
              secondary. Suppose that 230 V AC is applied to the primary winding.
              Calculate the output voltage.

                         =
                 V2          N2
              Then:
                 230             560

                    V2            20
              So:
                             230 × 20
                 V2 =                        = 8.21 V
                                   560

              If the secondary current is 4 A, calculate the input primary current.

            Transformer power ratings
            As a transformer is not a load, simply a method of changing voltage and current,
            it is rated in kVA. This is because certain loads may include a power factor,
            which can increase the current demand by the load. As a result, the rating of the
            transformer is given in volt amperes (VA) instead of kilowatts (kW). So when
            selecting a transformer for a particular load, the actual current drawn by the load
            must be multiplied by the voltage.

            AND EQUIPMENT
            Current behaves differently depending on the type of load connected to an AC
            circuit. Some loads cause current to lag and some lead where others keep the
            current in unity with the voltage. Where leading or lagging currents exist, so too
            does power factor. This section looks at how properties of a circuit change in
            AC systems.

              proportional to the applied       sinusoidal voltages and currents have no phase shift and are described as being ‘in
              voltage and inversely             phase’. This in-phase or unity relationship can be understood using Ohm’s law for

                                                As there is no phase shift effect, there is no requirement in a resistive circuit to
                                                include the power factor. Resistive loads in AC circuits include items such as
                                                incandescent lamps, water heater (immersion) elements and electric kettles. Any load

             Figure 2.27 Relationship between voltage and current as shown by a waveform

            The sine wave (Figure 2.27) shows the voltage and current rising and falling at the
            same time. In AC circuits involving resistance only, Ohm’s law applies as:

                 V=I×R

            Inductance
            An inductor is a length of wire; sometimes this is a longer wire wound
            into a coil with a core of iron or air. An inductor is a component, such as
            a solenoid or field winding in a motor or a ballast unit in a fluorescent
            luminaire, that induces (produces) magnetism. Inductance is proportional
            to the inductor’s opposition to AC current flow.
                                                                                                                         L
            ●    The symbol for inductance is L.
            ●    The unit of inductance is the henry (H).

            As inductance increases and all other factors, such as frequency, remain
            the same, AC current flow reduces. This opposition to AC current flow is
            indicated as an increase in inductive reactance X L.                                       I
            We will assume that an inductor in a circuit produces pure inductance
            but this is actually impossible; as an inductor is a coiled wire, it also has
            resistance.
                                                                                                                         V
            A pure inductance, as shown in the circuit diagram in Figure 2.28, will                                      ~
            create a phase shift that causes the current to lag behind the voltage
            by 90°.                                                                                 Figure 2.28 An inductor in a circuit

                                             The phasor diagram (Figure 2.29) shows the phase shift. When the phasor is
                                             rotated in the direction shown, the voltage leads the current or, as we normally
                                             say, the current lags behind the voltage. If the inductance was pure, this lag would
                                             be 90°. We shall explore how to create a phasor diagram later in this chapter.

                                             If you look at the lagging current sine wave, you will see that the current does not
                                             begin its cycle until the voltage is 90° into its cycle. Where the voltage begins its
                                             negative half-cycle, the current is still in a positive cycle – meaning the two values
                                             are reacting to one another. This is known as reactance, X, measured in ohms (Ω).
                                             As the reactance is linked to an inductor, we call this inductive reactance (X L).
                                             The reactance in the circuit can be determined using the value of inductance (L) in
                                             henries (H) and the frequency of the supply (f ) measured in hertz (Hz). So
                                                XL = 2πfL

              then:
                 XL = 2π × 50 × 40 × 10–3 = 12.57 Ω
              If the inductance is pure, the reactance replaces resistance in Ohm’s law so:
                        V
                 I=
                        XL

              So using the example above, the value of circuit current would be:
                         230
                 I=             = 18.3 A
                        12.57
              Assuming the inductance to be pure, this current would lag the voltage by 90°.
              Remember, however, that the inductance cannot be pure as the coil or winding
              is made up of a conductor which has resistance. We shall study the effect of
              resistance on an inductor later in this chapter.

            Capacitance
            A capacitor is a device that is used to store and discharge energy. It does not                 INDUSTRY TIP
            contain a resistance so it does not dissipate energy. A capacitor can be pure.
            Capacitors are used in circuits for many reasons; most commonly, capacitors are          The amount of energy stored
            found in electrical installations for power factor correction purposes. Capacitance      in a capacitor is very small.
            (C) is measured in farads (F) – usually expressed in micro-farads. One micro-farad       In a typical fluorescent
            (µF) is one-millionth (10 –6) of a farad.                                                capacitor it is about 0.1 J.

            A capacitor has the opposite effect to an inductor when connected to an AC
            circuit; it causes the current to lead the voltage by 90°.

            This current is determined by using the circuit impedance (Z) measured in ohms.
            Impedance can be determined by:

                 Z = R2 + X 2

            The value of reactance (X ) depends on the component used, so if an inductance is
            connected with an impedance, XL is used and for capacitance XC is used.
            Where a circuit contains both, the resulting reactance is used; this is the smallest
            value subtracted from the largest.

                                            having a 12.56 Ω reactance and a capacitor having a 26.52 Ω reactance.
                                            The total reactance is:

                                                X = XC – X L

                                            as the capacitive reactance is the larger value.
                                            So as:

                                           Using the triangle and Pythagoras’ theorem, we can see that the impedance value
                                           alters depending on the values of resistance or impedance. Impedance triangles
                                           are drawn to scale. If the value of reactance increases or decreases, this affects
                                           the angle between the resistance (R) and impedance (Z ). We shall explore this
                                           relationship later in this chapter when we look at power factor.

            this chapter that the inductor has pure inductance. This, in reality, is
            not possible as the conductor that is used to form the inductor’s coil
            has a resistance. These two properties are in series with one another.
            As with DC circuits, if components are connected in series, the current
                                                                                                I
            is constant (that is, it is the same through each component), but the
            voltage changes as it is ‘lost’ across each component, creating voltage
            drop or a potential difference.

               d The value of voltage across each component part is determined from
                 Ohm’s law:
                   VR = I × R      so          VR = 5.51 × 40 = 220.4 V
                   VL =I × R L     so          VL = 5.51 × 11.93 = 65.73 V

              As you can see, the two voltages do not add up to the supply voltage of 230 V.
              This is because the supply voltage would be the phasor sum of the two values as
              each component reacts differently to AC current.
              We can determine the phasor sum in two ways, by calculation (using Pythagoras’
              theorem) or by constructing a phasor to represent the two components.

            Determining the phasor sum by calculation
                 Vsupply = VR 2 + VL2

            so
                 Vsupply = 220.42 + 65.732 = 229.99 V or 230 V

                                           line, phasor diagrams must be drawn using a suitable scale.
                                           Once a reference line is drawn, the line representing the voltage across the resistor
                                           is drawn. As this voltage is in unity to the current, this line is plotted on the
                                           reference line (Figure 2.39).
                                           Then we add the value of the inductor voltage to the same scale.
                                           As the current lags in an inductive circuit, the voltage VL is drawn upwards. This
                                           is to show that the current (reference line) lags the voltage (given the direction of
                                           rotation). As we must assume this component to be pure, the line is drawn 90°
                                           from the reference line (Figure 2.40).
                                           Then we construct a parallelogram from the two voltage values (Figure 2.41).

            Finally, the resulting supply voltage is drawn in, connecting the origin to the point
            where the two sides of the parallelogram intersect (Figure 2.42). The length of this
            line, to the scale used, represents the supply voltage VS.
            We can see from the phasor that the current lags behind the supply voltage by a
            particular angle less than 90° – the resistance acts against the pure inductance,
            meaning the current lag is not fully 90°.

              ACTIVITY
                                             c As Z = R 2 + X 2    and    X = XC – X L then
              A capacitor and inductor
              each of 200 Ω reactance            X = XC – XL = 26.53 – 11.94 = 14.59 Ω
              are connected in series
              to a 115 Ω resistor. What          So Z = 402 + 14.592 = 42.58 Ω
              is the voltage across the
                                                         V                                  230
              capacitor if the supply        d As I =                     then         I=           = 5.4 A
              voltage is 230 V?                          Z                                  42.58
                                             e The value of voltage across each component part is determined from
                                               Ohm’s law:
                                                 VR = I × R       so         VR = 5.4 × 40 = 216 V
                                                 VL = I × X L     so         VL = 5.4 × 11.94 = 64.48 V
                                                 VC = I × RC      so         Vc = 5.4 × 26.53 = 143.26 V


                                           Once again, we could prove the circuit supply voltage by calculation or phasor.




                                           Determining the phasor sum by calculation
                                                 Vsupply = VR 2 + VX 2 where VX = VC – VL
                                            Once again, subtract the smallest value from the largest:

                                                 VX = 143.26 – 64.48 = 78.78 V
                                            So
                                                 Vsupply = 2162 + 78.782 = 229.9 or 230 V



                                           Constructing a phasor
                                           We construct the phasor as before, but this time we insert the voltage across the
                                           capacitor before we construct the parallelogram. Remember, as the current leads
                                           the voltage in a capacitor, the voltage lags the reference line (in the downwards
                                           direction) by 90°.
                                           Following this, we take the smallest value of voltage in the capacitor or inductor
                                           from the largest, just as in the calculation, so we end up with a resulting voltage
                                           VX from which the parallelogram may be formed.
                                           We can see that the current now leads the voltage by a particular angle as the
                                           capacitor is the stronger component.

                                                 In the same way as we did for voltage, we can prove the circuit supply current by
                                                 calculation or phasor.

                                                 current. Notice that, this time, the voltage is the reference line as it is common
                                                 to all components. As the capacitor is the component, the supply current ends up

                                                                                                R and L in series with C

                                                                                                in parallel is a typical

              so:
                                                                                                arrangement. It is not
                    XL = 2π × 50 × 88 ×10–3 = 27.65 Ω                                           usually required to correct
                                                                                                to unity power factor.
              and:                                                                              Research why power
                                                                                                factor isn’t normally
                    Z = R2 + XL2                                                                corrected to unity.

              so:

                    Z = 122 + 27.652 = 30.14 Ω



              The current in the inductive/resistive section of the circuit is:
                         V
                    I=
                         Z

              so:
                             230
                    I=              = 7.63 A
                           30.14



              The current drawn by the capacitor is based on the capacitive reactance:
                               1
                    XC =
                             2πfC

              so:
                                         1
                    XC =                              = 21.22 Ω
                               2π × 50 × 150 × 10–6

              therefore as:
                           V
                    I=
                         XC

              then:
                             230
                    I=              = 10.84 A
                           21.22


            Showing this as a phasor to determine the total current requires a slightly
            different approach than before; we need first to construct a phasor using the
            series circuit values, then draw in the capacitance values. Before we do this,
            we need to understand how power factor affects the circuit and, therefore, the
            resulting phase angle.

              therefore, are reacting (giving
              reactance).                                                    have impedances and capacitors, the power behaves differently as an element of

            In order to correct the power factor on the incoming supply it is necessary to
            measure it. The most convenient and easiest method of measuring power factor
            at any point in a circuit or installation is by means of a power factor indicator. If
            an indicator is not available an accurate calculation can be made by taking watt,
            volt and ampere measurement as shown in Figure 2.56.

            The wattmeter is used to indicate true power (P in watts, W), whereas the volt
            and ammeter are used to calculate the apparent power (volt-amperes in VA).
            Since:

            then the above connected meters will enable the PF to be calculated.

            Methods of power factor correction
            The equipment available for improvement of the power factor can be divided into
            two main groups:
            ●    rotary, e.g. synchronous motors (although this system is rarely used today)
            ●    stationary, e.g. capacitors.
            Over-exciting a synchronous motor was often carried out in large factories during
            the postwar period to improve the overall power factor. Any large synchronous
            machines could be over-excited or run lightly to improve power factor. These
            motors would be used to supplement fixed banks of capacitors, which could be
            switched in to match the power factor throughout the day.

            Correction by capacitors
            The application of power factor correction capacitor banks is employed in
            electrical installations to correct the power factor.
            This is due to the fact that most circuits are inductive in nature, which creates a
            lagging power factor. By adding power factor correction capacitors to the circuit,
            the kVAr is reduced as the capacitive kVAr cancels out the inductive kVAr.

              If too much capacitance is
              added, the result will be an
              increase in apparent power as
              a lagging current becomes a
              leading current.

                                              Power factor correction in many installations is achieved by a bank or banks
                                              of fixed capacitors. Alternatively, where the load changes or more accurate
                                              correction is required, power factor correction is achieved through automatically
                                              switched capacitors. Automatic switching units use monitoring technology to
                                              switch capacitors in and out of the load automatically as the load profile changes.
                                              These units are in banks, normally in multiples of 50kVAr, so that the first bank
                                              of fixed capacitors deals with the base load. Remember that going too far with
                                              capacitors causes a leading power factor, which is again chargeable.
                                              Therefore, it is ideal to balance the load and switch in capacitors throughout the
                                              changing load profile to ensure the PF stays around 0.95. These units are normally
                                              installed at or near the intake position in a building in order to deal with the
                                              overall power factor correction.

                                              As well as using capacitor banks to correct power factor at source,
                                              the power factor may be corrected through the equipment. Installing
                                              suitably rated capacitors in parallel with a load improves the power factor. As an
                                              example, fluorescent luminaires contain capacitors for this reason. The capacitor is
                                              connected between line and neutral in the luminaire. If the capacitor is removed,
                                              the luminaire will still operate but it will draw slightly more current due to the
                                              power factor.

                                              Load profiling
                                              Load profiling is, quite simply, monitoring a supply to see times of demand. Most
                                              single-phase domestic installations can be easily monitored by using smart meter
                                              technology, giving real time usage statistics. Some data receiver units have the
                                              ability to store this data, thus giving a record of times of maximum and minimum
                                              consumption.

            Using this data, load forecasting can then be undertaken which can anticipate
            times of excessive consumption and automatically turn off non-essential loads
            during these periods. This can be achieved by using smart technologies such as
            smart switches or electric car chargers that can draw electricity from the charged
            car instead of charging it. This stored energy can then be used to power other
            appliances. The car battery could then be re-charged at times of lower demand,
            such as overnight.
            In situations where a dwelling both generates power to supply the grid as well as
            consuming power, it is known as a prosumer as it both produces and consumes.

                                                 this is sometimes not the case.
                                                 Where the load is not in balance, different currents circulate in the load through
                                                 the source winding and back. This gives rise to a change in star-point voltage,
                                                 which can result in the system ‘floating’ away from its earthed reference point.
                                                 In essence, a current will flow in the neutral. The three ways in which this current
                                                 value could be determined are:
                                                 ●   by phasor, an accurate method that indicates the angle at which the maximum
                                                     current occurs
                                                 ●   by calculation, which gives an accurate value
                                                 ●   by equilateral triangle, which gives a good indication of the value.

                                                and current values. Calculation of these values is essential in modern electrical
                                                engineering.


              ACTIVITY                          Voltage and current in star-connected

              system, calculate the
              phase voltage when the            In a star (Y) connected load:
              line voltage is: a) 400 V,        ●     the line current (IL) flows through the cable supplying each load
              b) 415 V, c) 11 kV,               ●     the phase current (IP) is the current flowing through each load.
              d) 110 V.
                                                So:
                                                      IL = IP

                                                and:
                                                ●     the voltage between any line conductors is the line voltage (VL)
                                                ●     the voltage across any one load is the phase voltage (VP)
                                                so:
                                                             VL

                                                In a balanced three-phase system there is no need to have a star-point connection
                                                to neutral as the current drawn by any one phase is taken out equally by the other
                                                two. Therefore the star point is naturally at zero.

            AND APPLICATIONS OF DC
            MACHINES AND AC MOTORS
            It is important to understand the differences in AC and DC machines and to
            appreciate where there are similarities in certain machine configurations.
                                                                                                       ACTIVITY

            because of the ability to control speed and direction. With advances in cheaper            such losses.
            AC alternatives, and the fact that DC machines were more prone to wear, their
            use declined. Now that the parts and control devices for DC machines are
            cheaper, the use of DC is on the increase again. A skilled electrician must therefore
            have a knowledge of DC machine operating principles.
            There is no difference in the construction of DC motors and generators.
            They are rotating machines with three basic features: a magnetic-field
            system, a system of conductors and provision for relative movement
            between the field and the conductors.
            The magnetic field in most DC machines is set up by the stationary
            part of the machine, called the field windings. The rotating part,
            known as the armature, is made up of multiple loops of cable linked
            to a commutator. Power is either delivered to (motor) or taken from
            (generator) the armature by brushes in contact with the moving
            commutator.

            DC generators
            The DC generator is supplied with mechanical energy and gives out most
            of the energy, less losses, as electrical energy.
            The DC generator has many loops and a multi-segmented
                                                                                             Figure 2.68 A segmented commutator

            to another so that the current in both conductors will always be the same.        wound around the armature.
            When the loops within the armature are rotated within the magnetic
            field, an emf is induced into the loop. The use of a commutator ensures that the
            brushes are always in contact with the loop, which is in the strongest part of the
            magnetic field, at all times. This ensures a steady flow of direct current.

              The shunt motor uses a shunt
              field regulator to control the
              speed. Increasing resistance
              decreases the current and
              flux, causing the motor speed
              to increase.

            Applications of DC machines
            Series-wound motors have excellent torque (load) characteristics and are used
            for applications such as dragline excavators, where the digging tool moves rapidly
            when unloaded but slowly when carrying a heavy load.
            Shunt motors are best used where constant speed and torque are to be
            maintained, for example, on a production line, so that items placed on it do not
            affect the speed.
            Compound motors offer the benefits of both series and shunt motors and have
            been used in older underground trains.
            Direct current generators do not have many practical uses in their own right.
            However, they can provide a reliable energy supply directly into batteries or where
            a DC supply is required.

            How AC machines operate
            The principle of operation for all AC motors relies on the interaction between a
            revolving magnetic field created in the stator by an AC current, with an opposing
            magnetic field either induced on the rotor or provided by a separate DC current
            source. This produces a torque that can be used to drive various loads.

                                           The synchronous motor and induction motor are the most widely used types
                                           of AC motor. The difference between the two types of motor is that in a
                                           synchronous motor the rotation of the shaft is synchronised with the frequency
                                           of the supply current, and in an induction motor the rotor rotates slightly slower
                                           than the AC supply current in order to develop torque. The synchronous motor
                                           therefore operates at a precise speed.

                                           A single-phase generator is composed of a single stator winding with one pair
                                           of terminals. With a single pair of rotating poles, the output waveform is as shown
                                           in Figure 2.73.

            The induction motor is the simplest and most common form of motor. The stator
            consists of a laminated body with slots for the field windings to pass through. The
            rotor is a laminated cylinder with conducting bars just below the surface.

            In its simplest form, the rotor consists of a number of conductors passing through
            holes in a rotor drum. The ends are brazed together, causing the formation of a
            cage, which is why it is called a cage rotor.
            Cage induction motors are cheaper and smaller, but produce less torque, than

            The use of simple induction motors with readily available variable frequency
            drives means the wound rotor motor is less common, as changing the frequency
            will also affect the synchronous speed and therefore the rotor speed.
            Where a process does not require a motor to run at full speed, a variable

            In most capacitor-start motors, the capacitor is switched out of circuit by a
            centrifugal switch. The capacitor-start-and-run motor is a variant that does not
            switch out the capacitor.
            Shaded-pole motors
            The shaded-pole motor is quite commonly used in devices, such as domestic
            appliances, that require low starting torque.
            The motor is constructed with small single-turn copper shading coils, which create
            the moving magnetic field required to start a single-phase motor. A small section
            of each pole is encircled by a copper coil or strap; the induced current in the strap
            opposes the change of flux through the coil. This causes a time lag in the flux
            passing through the shading coil, creating an opposing pole to the main part of the
            pole. This effect is the same as having a phase shift causing an opposing polarity.

            Applications of three-phase AC machines
            AC generators
            The AC generator or alternator is very widely used, e.g. in hybrid electrical vehicle
            drives, small- and large-scale power generators, wind turbines or micro-hydro
            systems (small hydro-electric plant using stream water).

            Induction motors
            The cage induction motor is a simple, cost-effective induction motor. Advances
            in technologies for drive systems (e.g. thyristor (silicon-controlled rectifier)) and
            speed-control drives have enabled simple induction motors to replace more
            expensive wound rotor induction and some DC motors. Such technologies offer
            simple speed-controlled drives and reduced current starting for ‘soft start’
            systems.
            As a result, induction motors are used in a wide range of applications, such as
                                                                                                              INDUSTRY TIP
            pumps, hoists, lifts and many other machines. The cage rotor is particularly useful        When adding remote controls,
            because it has fewer parts that are subject to wear, having no brushes or slip rings.      remember stop buttons are

            To avoid short circuits, the star and delta contactors are normally physically
            interlocked by an electrical interlock and a mechanical connecting rod to prevent
            both contactors being in circuit at the same time.

            This type of starting device works by introducing variable resistance to the

            Electronic motor starters
            These motor soft-starters are used with AC motors to reduce the load and
            torque in the motor circuit during start-up. This is normally achieved by reducing
            the voltage; then, as the motor starts to achieve running speed, the voltage is
            ramped up. The term ‘soft-start’ applies to the mechanical stresses placed on the
            components as well, as they are also not subjected to intense starting forces.
            Variable frequency drives (VFD) control the motor speed and torque of AC
            induction motors, by adjusting the frequency and voltage. They save energy and
            money by adjusting constant-speed devices, such as pumps and fans, to match
            the appropriate outputs.

            Operating principles of motor control
            Some motors use reverse-current braking and, where such reversal might result in
            danger, measures should be taken to prevent continued reversal after the driven
            parts come to a standstill at the end of the braking period. Further, where safety
            is dependent on the motor operating in the correct direction, means should be
            provided to prevent reverse operation. Where motor control systems incorporate
            overload devices, these devices should be checked to ensure the settings are
            correct and re-sets are correctly set to manual or automatic.

                                                 everyday use and how they work.
                                                 Electricity is an everyday commodity to which most users give little thought.
                                                 The range and usage of electricity grows every day. New products continue
                                                 to enter the market and are added to the wide range of electrically powered
                                                 equipment that people use in everyday life and very quickly take for granted.

                                                              Solenoids
                                                              The strength of a magnetic field is proportional to the current flowing
                                                              through it. Even with a high current passing through a conductor,
                                                              the field produced is relatively weak, in terms of useful magnetism.
                                                              To obtain a stronger magnetic field, a number of conductors can be
                                                              added by turning or winding the cable.
                                                              The most common form of this arrangement is the solenoid, which
                                                              consists of one long insulated conductor wound to form a coil. The
                                                              winding of the coil causes the magnetic fields to merge into a stronger
                         I                                    field similar to that of a permanent bar magnet. The strength of the
                                                              field depends on the current and the number of turns.

             Figure 2.87 Relay showing contact positions
            Relays are used often to control a circuit by a low-power signal in complete
            isolation from the larger circuit, or multiple circuits, being controlled. The first
            relays were used in long-distance telegraph circuits, repeating the signal coming
            in from one circuit and re-transmitting it to another. Relays were then used
            extensively in telephone exchanges to perform logic functions and operations.

            With modern technological advances, not all relays consist of a coil operating a
            set of magnets. Solid-state relays either replace or are available in conjunction
            with electromechanical relays. Solid-state relays control electrical circuits despite
            having no moving parts. Instead, they use a semiconductor device to perform the
            switching.

            A relay that can handle the high power used to control directly an electric motor
            or other loads is called a contactor. There is little difference between a relay and       A typical application of a
            a contactor, but generally contactors are devices that switch heavier loads on and         contactor is to control a large
            off, whereas relays either switch or divert (like a two-way switch) lower current          heating load by the use of a

            Fuses
            Fuses have been a tried and tested method of circuit protection for many years. A
            fuse is a very basic protection device that melts and breaks the circuit should the
            current exceed the rating of the fuse. Once the fuse has ‘blown’ (i.e. the element
            in the fuse has melted or ruptured), it needs to be replaced.

                                                          Fuses have several ratings.
                                                          ●   In is the nominal current rating. This is the maximum current that
                                                              the fuse can carry, without disconnection, and without reducing the
                                                              expected life of the fuse.
                                                          ●   Ia is the disconnection current rating. This is the value of current that will
                                                              cause the disconnection of the fuse in a given time, such as 0.4 seconds.

                                                              can safely disconnect fault currents. Any fault current above this rating
                                                              may cause the fuse and carrier to explode.

                                                          In older equipment, the fuse may be just a length of appropriate fuse wire
                                                          fixed between two terminals. There are increasingly fewer of these devices
                                                          around as electrical installations are rewired or updated.

                                                          major problem is that the incorrect rating of wire can easily be inserted
                                                          when replacing the fuse wire, leaving the circuit underprotected.

                                                   BS 88 fuses
                                                   These fuses are generally incorporated into sealed cylindrical ceramic bodies
                                                   (or cartridges). If the element inside blows, the whole cartridge needs to be
                                                   replaced. Although these devices have fixed time current curves, they can be
                                                   configured to assist selectivity. The benefit of BS 88 and similar fuses is their
                                                   simplicity and reliability, coupled with high short-circuit breaking capacity.

            Circuit breakers are thermomagnetic devices capable of making, carrying and
            interrupting currents under normal and abnormal conditions. They fall into
            two categories: miniature circuit breakers (MCBs), which are common in most
            installations for the protection of final circuits, and moulded-case circuit breakers                INDUSTRY TIP
            (MCCBs), which are normally used for larger distribution circuits.

                                                         manufacture. They generally have a lower prospective short-circuit current rating

                                                         10 kA. Specialist units are available for higher values.
                                                         The operating characteristics of MCBs can be shown in graphical form by a

              has come down as their use
              has become more widespread.                reacts within a time specific to the overload current. The bigger the overload, the

            Residual current breakers with overload (RCBOs) combine an overcurrent
            protective device with an RCD in the body of the CB.
            Unlike CBs, RCDs and RCBOs have a test button, which should be pressed
            at very regular intervals to keep the mechanical parts working effectively.
            If the mechanical components in a CB stick, there is not much concern
            as the energy needed to trip a CB is large enough to unstick any seized parts. As
            RCDs and RCBOs operate under earth fault conditions, with relatively
            small residual currents, there may not be enough energy to free any
            seized parts.

                                           Solenoids have a number of functions. They are often used as electrical–mechanical
                                           transducers (converters), i.e. they convert an electrical signal into mechanical action.

                                           Solenoids are also often used in electromagnetic locking devices, either to engage
                                           or to retract the locking mechanism. Where safety is essential, such solenoids are
                                           usually positioned so that the system drops to a safe position if the electrical circuit
                                           fails. For example, a door release magnet will release the door in the event of a fire.

                                           by use of remote contacts. Some relays operate a large number of contacts,

                                                The lack of reliability of these fuses is a concern to designers and duty holders.
                                                Due to the lack of sensitivity, special factors have been applied to Appendix 4 of
                                                BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition to account for
                                                these fuses. This rating factor to be applied (Cf ) is 0.725.

                                                BS 88 fuses
                                                High-rupturing capacity (HRC) or high-breaking capacity (HBC) fuses are common
                                                in many industrial installations. They are also very common in switch fuses or
                                                fused switches controlling specific items of equipment. They are particularly
                                                suited to installations with a high prospective fault current (Ipf) as they have
                                                breaking capacities of up to 80 kA.
                                                BS 88 fuses come in two categories:
                                                ●   gG for general circuit applications, where high inrush currents are not expected
                                                ●   gM for motor-rated circuits or similar, where high inrush currents are expected.

                                                Miniature circuit breakers (MCBs)
                                                There are three common types of MCB: Type B, Type C and Type D. The difference
                         INDUSTRY TIP           between the devices is the value of current (Ia) at which the magnetic part of the
                                                device trips. The different types are selected to suit loads where particular inrush
              In a fused switch the fuses

              are mounted on the moving
              contacts. In a switch fuse, the   Type B trips between three and five times the rated current (3 to 5 × In). These
              fuse and switch are in series     MCBs are normally used for domestic circuits and commercial applications where
              and the fuse does not move.       there is no inrush current to cause it to trip. For example, the magnetic tripping
                                                current in a 32 A Type B CB could be 160 A. So Ia = 5 × In. These MCBs are used
                                                where maximum protection is required and therefore should be the choice for
                                                general socket-outlet applications.

            Type C trips between five and ten times the rated current (5 to 10 × In). These
            MCBs are normally used for commercial applications where there are small to
            medium motors or fluorescent luminaires and where there is some inrush current
            that would cause the CB to trip. For example, the magnetic tripping current in a
            32 A Type C CB could be 320 A. So Ia = 10 × In.

            Type D trips between ten and twenty times the rated current (10 to 20 × In).
            These MCBs are for specific industrial applications where there are large inrushes
            of current for industrial motors, X-ray units, welding equipment, etc. For example,
            the magnetic trip in a 32 A Type D CB could be 640 A. So Ia = 20 × In.

            MCCBs are available in various ranges. Lower-cost simpler versions are
            thermomagnetic with no adjustment. Other devices have electronic trip units and
            sensitivity settings or the ability to be de-rated.
            Most MCCBs are used on larger circuits or distribution circuits where larger
            prospective short circuits are likely but the flexibility of an electronic trip is also
            required.

                                                RCDs are sensitive devices, typically operating on earth fault currents as low as

                                                The use of such a device is useful for supplies to portable electrical equipment
                                                where the risk of shock to the user might be higher than would otherwise be the

             Space–height ratio                                        This ratio is used to determine how close together luminaires need

            Some lamps, such as light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, are rated in lumens whereas
            others are rated in candela. Take care with this as the choice of lamp depends on
            its application. To illuminate a particular point, such as a kitchen work surface, the
            candela rating is important as it rates the intensity of light in a particular direction.
            For illuminating a general area, such as a driveway, the luminous flux (lumens) is a
            better indicator as it measures the total light output in all directions.

            Calculating for the lumen method
            The lumen method is appropriate for use in lighting design if the luminaires are to
            be mounted overhead in a regular pattern.
            The luminous flux output (lumens) of each lamp needs to be known, as well as
            details of the luminaires and the room surfaces.
            Usually, the illuminance will already have been specified by the designer,
            e.g. office 350–450 lux.


            The formula is:

                         Eaverage × A
                 N=

            Colour rendering
            The term ‘colour rendering’ describes the ability of a lamp or luminaire to keep
            objects looking their true colour. Some lamps emit orange light and so objects lit                                     INDUSTRY TIP

                                           Incandescent lamps
                                           This is the simplest form of lamp, with a current passed through a filament. The
                                           filament gets white hot and therefore emits light.

                                           Tungsten filament lamps
                                           Tungsten has a high melting temperature (3380 °C) and the ability to be drawn
                                           out into a fine wire.
                                           In order to prevent premature failure through oxidation, oxygen must be removed
                                           from the enclosing glass bulb. Small lamps are evacuated, creating a vacuum
                                           in the bulb, but larger lamps are filled with argon, which reduces filament
                                           evaporation at high temperatures. The efficacy of filament lamps is relatively low
                                           but increases with the larger sizes. Colour rendering is generally very good but
                                           does depend on the glass finish of the lamp.

                                           Tungsten-halogen lamps
                                           Adding a halogen, such as iodine, to the enclosure prevents evaporation and
                                           allows the lamp to be run at a higher temperature. Colour rendering is very good
                                           with these lamps.

                                           Halogen cycle
                                           If a halogen gas is present in a lamp with a tungsten filament, the atoms of
                                           tungsten that are driven off the filament attach to halogen molecules instead
                                           of collecting on the lamp wall. They are eventually returned to the filament and
                                           separated. The tungsten is deposited on the filament. The halogen gas molecules
                                           are free to circulate again and available to intercept other tungsten atoms.

                                           Halogens condense at about 300 °C, so the lamp must be kept above this
                                           temperature. The lamp is made of quartz glass, which can be weakened if touched
                                           by a person. Oil from the skin can lead to gas leaking from the glass. Handling

            Several types of lamp produce light by establishing a permanent electric arc in a
            gas. This process is known as electric discharge or gaseous discharge. It is used to
            produce light in fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps.

            How discharge lamps work
            Electrons are driven through the gas or vapour by the tube voltage, colliding with                INDUSTRY TIP
            atoms as they go. The collisions are severe enough to break a loosely held electron
                                                                                                       Some discharge lamps will

            around the inside of the gas tube.
            When gas is cold, it has a high resistance and therefore requires a high-voltage
            ‘strike’ to ionise the gas. Once gas is ionising, its resistance falls, meaning lower
            voltages can maintain ionisation. However, as proved by Ohm’s law, a lower
            resistance will result in larger currents flowing. In order to create a high-voltage
            strike and limit running currents, discharge luminaires require control gear.

            For AC supplies, an electronic control or an iron-cored inductor (also known as a
            choke or ballast) is used, rather than the resistor used for DC supplies.                         INDUSTRY TIP

            To understand how the control gear works, look at the process, using a fluorescent         Electronic starters prevent
            luminaire (low-pressure mercury discharge lamp) as an example.                             damage to the tube as they
                                                                                                       only allow a few attempts

              flowing through the inductor induces a magnetic field within the inductor.
              As the gas in the tube is cold, the voltage is not enough to break down the
              resistance.
            2 The starter switch opens, which open circuits the inductor. This causes the
              magnetic field in the inductor suddenly to collapse, creating a high voltage. This
              voltage strikes across the tube, ionising the gas, which reduces in resistance, and
              completes the circuit.

                                                 3 With the circuit once again complete, current flows through the inductor, which
                                                   re-induces a magnetic field, causing self-induction, which limits the current flow.
                                                   The starter switch is no longer required as the gas remains ionised with a
                                                   constant current passing through it.

                                                      The switch starter is enclosed in a small glass tube containing neon gas,
                                                      which glows and produces heat. The switch contacts are bimetals and the
                                                      heat causes them to bend so that they touch.
                                                      When the fluorescent tube is lit, the current in the tube causes a voltage drop
                                                      in the choke, so that the lamp voltage across the switch contacts is too low
                                                      to cause a glow in the neon. As it is open circuit when unheated, the switch
                                                      starter has no more effect on the luminaire circuit. If the tube fails to strike
                                                      first time, the process repeats until striking is achieved.

            These lamps have poor colour rendering but very good efficacy. They were widely
            used for most roadway applications but, due to increasing use of CCTV in towns
            and on roads, they are slowly being phased out and replaced with high-pressure

                                                in the tubes is toxic and the sodium in the lamps burns when in contact with
                                                moisture. It is therefore important that the tubes and lamps remain intact for

            These are miniature fluorescent tubes compacted into a small space. The control
            gear is contained in the base of the lamp. They are intended as energy-saving
            replacements for incandescent lamps although the colour rendering and flickering
            mean that many people find them difficult to use for reading or close work.

            LED lights
            The LED is a light-emitting diode. These lights are usually made from inorganic
            substances such as gallium indium nitride and gallium phosphide. The colour
            of the light output depends on the material used for the diode. LED lamps
            now come in a variety of colours and colour temperatures, such as Daylight or
            warm white.
            The light output is usually monochromatic, i.e. the light emitted is at a single
            wavelength. The most common way to create a white light is to apply a phosphor-
            based coating to a blue diode. The phosphor converts the blue light to white light
            in a range of colour temperatures. The quality of the white light is affected both
            by the choice of LED and by the properties of the phosphor.
            LEDs are very small; the active light-emitting surface is no bigger than 1–2 mm².
            A single diode can rarely produce enough light for a given lighting situation. For
            the unit to work, it must be mounted on a circuit board, with multiple LEDs in a
            cluster to form an LED module.
            LEDs can be powered in two ways: with constant current or constant voltage. The
            ballast, which is referred to as the driver, is the unit that drives an LED array.

                                            Although some LEDs run on conventional transformers, these can lack certain
                                            kinds of safety feature, such as short-circuit protection. When driven correctly,
                                            LEDs are claimed to be able to run for 50 000 hours, which is considerably longer

                                            building designers. It may however be the only choice when electricity is the only

            How electrical space heating and electrical
            water heating systems work
            When current flows in a wire, apart from the flow of electrons, there is a thermal
            effect; the wire starts to heat up. The amount it heats up depends on factors such
            as the cross-sectional area of the wire, the amount of current flowing and the
            material that the wire is made of.
            The heating effect of electricity is used in electrical heating systems such as
            electric fires, electric space heating and water heating.
            Variations of this heat effect are also used to make light from light-bulb (lamp)
            filaments, which give off large amounts of light because they glow white hot as a
            result of the current passing through the thin filament.

            Electrical space heating systems
            The three ways to transfer heat from one medium to another are:
            ●    convection
            ●    conduction
            ●    radiation.
            Many heat sources use a combination of these methods.

            Electrical water heating systems
            There are many different types of electrically powered water heaters, including
            rod-type immersion heaters and instantaneous water heaters.

            Operating principles of electrical
            space heating systems
            Convection
            Hot air rises and colder air falls through the                           Warm air rises
            process of convection. A simple convection panel
            heater mounted on a wall uses this principle to
            move warm air around a room.                                                                             Air falls as
                                                                                                                      it cools
            A convection heater usually has a low-                                   Heating element
                                                                                       heating air
            temperature ‘black-heat’ element. Air in contact
            with the element is warmed and becomes less
            dense, so that it rises and is replaced by colder
            air, which is then warmed in turn.
            Some convection heaters heat up another
            medium by conduction. For example, the
                                                                               Cold air drawn in
            element can be submersed in oil. The oil transfers                 as warm air rises
            heat around the unit, giving a larger body of heat
            to start the convection cycle.
            Traditionally, convection heaters such as central
            heating emitters (radiators) are positioned where
            colder air is present, such as under windows, as this
            produces a larger cycle effect. This is less relevant    Figure 2.116 Convection cycle

                                             Conduction
                                             Conduction is the effect of heating something by direct contact. For example, the
                         INDUSTRY TIP        underfloor heating elements directly below a tiled floor warm the tiles and heat is

            Underfloor heating
            Underfloor heating systems have been around for centuries, although electrically
            powered versions have been available for a much shorter period. Since the 1960s
            the popularity of electric underfloor heating has fluctuated. In more recent times,
            it has become particularly associated with bathrooms and tiled areas. In many
            cases, underfloor heating is only installed in new houses or extensions as it is very
            costly to install into existing floors.

            Underfloor heating is an effective system of transferring heat into the floor
            surface by conduction and then heating the room by radiant heat and convection.
            It is a very good way of providing a uniform heat in a space.

            Storage heaters
            Storage heaters charge up at night when energy is available at low cost on off-
            peak tariffs. The energy is then stored in the unit in fireclay blocks, which release
            it slowly during the day. Radiator-type and fan-type storage heaters are available.
            The radiator type is heated by elements in fireclay blocks. The release of heat is
            controlled by insulation. The storage heater is sized to store enough heat to last all
            day, under controlled release conditions.

            The fan-assisted storage heater is usually larger and always noisier than the
            radiator-type equivalent.

            Panel heaters
            Panel heaters heat spaces by convection and radiation. They can be slim in design
            and can even be fitted to the front of storage heaters to provide daytime heating
            if the stored charge has been lost.
            Most panel heaters are provided with thermostatic and time controls.
            Although they can be fairly expensive to run, they are often chosen as
            a means of heating reasonably small locations or locations where other
            services, such as hot-water central-heating systems, are difficult to install.

            Radiant or infrared heaters
            These types of heater are particularly useful in large, cold areas where
            heating the air is difficult. Examples are garage workshops and warehouses.
            The heat radiated warms bodies but not the air around them. They would
            work just as effectively in a vacuum.                                               Figure 2.123 An infrared heater

            Operating principles of electrical water heating systems
            Immersion heater systems
            Immersion heater systems usually contain large amounts of water, which are heated
            over a period of time. The size of the vessel and limited amount of circulation
            and mixing allows relatively hot water to be used on demand. Then the heat is
            replenished over a period of time.
            A large copper or stainless steel vessel is filled with water from a separate
            cold-water tank or sealed pressurisation unit. The vessel has an electric heater
            element fitted through a screw-threaded fitting, known as a boss.
                                                                                                Boss
            The heater element can be the length of the cylinder, but in some
            instances two shorter elements are used, one positioned high and

            switching on the top element, just a small proportion of the water

            hot liquids stay at the top) and works if the water is used before

                                                         To ensure that there is a full tank of hot water, a longer element is fitted
                                                         to heat the whole tank. Temperature is controlled by a rod thermostat
                                                         fitted in a pocket tube in the head of the heater. However, there are also
                                                         strap-on thermostats that fix to the exterior of the hot water cylinder.
                                                         Many immersion heaters also have a thermal cut-out to open the element
                                                         circuit, should the thermostat fail and the water reach dangerously high
                                                         temperatures, which could lead to enormous pressures in the tank or the
                                                         venting of scalding water through the overflow or expansion pipe.
                                                         In order to save energy, thermal insulation is added to the vessel during
                                                         manufacture or a thermally insulated jacket is fitted after installation.

                                                         Instantaneous water heaters
             Figure 2.126 Thermostat inside pocket in   There are many examples of instantaneous water heaters; most common
              heater element                             are electric showers and point-of-use hand washers, fitted above or below
                                                         sinks.
                                                 With all of these heaters there is a limit to how much water can be raised to a
                                                 specific temperature in a given time. This depends on the flow rate. The slower
                                                 the flow rate, the hotter the water will get.
                                                 There are two types of instantaneous hot-water system. The tank type is like a
                                                 miniature hot water cylinder. In the other type, the elements wrap around the
                                                 water pipe inside the unit.

            How to control heating systems
            Heating and hot-water systems are not controlled just for economic reasons.
            Control is also a legal requirement for safety reasons. Building Regulations
            demand control.

            Room thermostats and control circuits
            Room thermostats are used to provide temperature control when heating
            spaces. Traditionally, this is done by means of a simple adjustable bimetallic
            sensor incorporating a set of contacts. When the desired temperature is reached,
            the contacts open due to the bimetal bending. This stops water-based heating
            systems pumping heat around or, on more advanced systems, operates a
            valve that shuts off the water, but still heats water until it reaches the desired
            temperature, when the pump or boiler/heater will switch off.

            In its simplest form, a 24-hour time switch cannot differentiate between
            days of the week. This is wasteful and a nuisance on days when the
            heating is required at different times from the norm. A programmable time
            controller is therefore normally installed as a minimum requirement for
            Building Regulations and convenience.
            Simple domestic programmers allow the user to select the temperature
            required at set points on individual days of the week.
            In commercial environments, controllers can be more sophisticated with
            optimum start functions. The user inputs the time at which they wish a
            specific temperature to be reached. The programmer uses thermostats to
            estimate the start-up time in order to reach the specified temperature and
            the time to switch off again in order to reduce the temperature at the end
            of the day.                                                                                                              Figure 2.133 Simple daily time switch

                                            BS 7671 needs to constantly change to keep up with technological advances and
                                            the risks they introduce to the electrical installation process. For example, since

                                            This has had a huge impact on the main bonding to the gas installation pipework
                                            so, when the 18th Edition was published, new requirements were added to
                                            address this issue.
                                            Due to the massive rate of technological advances, and therefore practices and

                                            of BS 7671. Sections of BS 7671 that are not covered are considered too advanced
                                            or specialist for this book.

                                            Chapter 11: Scope
                                            Part 1 sets out the scope of BS 7671.
                                            Regulation 110.1.1 gives a comprehensive list of the installations that BS 7671
                                            applies to.
                                            Regulation 110.1.2 clarifies the voltage ranges and aspects of a building or
                                            premises that BS 7671 applies to.
                                            Owing to the large range of installations covered by the scope of BS 7671, it is
              ACTIVITY                      sometimes easier to see what is not covered. Regulation 110.2 lists the systems
                                            that BS 7671 does not apply to.
              Consider the potential
              causes of injury, as given
              in Regulation 131.1, and      Chapter 12: Object and Effects
              write down a situation that
                                            Chapter 12 states the rationale for BS 7671 and explains that the technical
              could cause each of them
              to happen.                    content (in Parts 3 to 7) is the most susceptible to change in the event of
                                            technical developments.

            determining the cross-sectional area of conductors.
            Section 133 gives principles relating to the selection of equipment, and Section
            134 relates to the installation and initial verification of the equipment.
            Although the fundamental principles are not detailed or technical, they give the
            commonsense requirements, and these have to be stated somewhere.

            Part 2 is not divided into chapters as it simply provides definitions of technical
            terms used throughout BS 7671. Part 2 effectively looks like and works like a                      You will probably be familiar

                ● current causing the operation of the protective device within the specified time.




            PART 3: ASSESSMENT OF
            GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
            Part 3 is where the technical detail of BS 7671 starts. General characteristics are
            all the things that need to be considered when designing an electrical installation.
            As an example, Section 311 deals with the supply characteristic. With no electrical
            supply, there would be no electrical installation!

                                              Part 3 is likened to a site survey before any design or work commences. If there is
                                              no site yet, because it is a new building, then discussions with clients and studying
                                              drawings are both essential to assess the characteristics.

                                              depend on the type of conductor and the earthing arrangements of the supply.

                                              Conductor arrangements
                                              In the UK, supply conductors can typically be:
                                              ●   single-phase two-wire, as shown in Figure 3.1 in BS 7671; or
                                              ●   three-phase four-wire, as shown in Figure 3.5 in BS 7671.

            TN-C-S arrangements combine the earth and neutral conductors as one in the
            supply. This brings advantages because the earth fault loop impedance of the
            supply network can remain low as the neutral/earth or PEN is a copper conductor.

            maintain Ze for a TN-C-S system below 0.35 Ω, and while that is common, it is
            not always the case.

            TN-S arrangements often use the lead sheath of the cable as the protective
            conductor. Although many TN-S arrangements still exist, the savings made
            by installing or maintaining one fewer conductor is the reason for electricity
            distribution companies converting TN-S distribution systems to TN-C-S.
            TN-S earthing arrangements are often adopted for large installations supplied
            by their own transformer. They are also found in old (circa pre-1970) domestic
            installations.

            Electricity suppliers will often refuse to provide PME to certain installations, such as
            temporary supplies to construction sites. This is because of the difficulty of bonding
            all connections with earth together in a site and the risks of an open circuit PEN
            conductor causing circuit current to find an alternate path. Because the earthing
            of a PME system comes from the neutral, if current cannot flow back to the

                                                Regulation 313.1 requires the designer of an installation to determine supply

                                                that every circuit shall be independent, which means that all circuits must have

                                                are all the factors that will need to be considered for their possible impact on the
                                                installed equipment; for example:
                                                ●   environment – temperature, moisture, heat and so much more
                                                ●   utilisation – who uses the building
                                                ●   building – what the building is constructed of.

                                                Chapter 33: Compatibility
                                                The compatibility of the parts intended for installation needs to be assessed to
                                                make sure that one part does not have a detrimental effect on another part.
                                                For example, if a machine has high starting currents, this will put a strain on the
                                                supply system, causing lights to dim each time the machine starts. As a result, the
                                                designer must specify a soft start, thereby reducing the high start-up current.

            Chapter 34: Maintainability
            A designer is required to assess the frequency and quality of maintenance that
            installed equipment is likely to receive. It is the designer’s responsibility to set
            the time period between initial verification and the first periodic inspection. This
            will be based on the quality and suitability of the materials used and the likely
            maintenance they will receive.

            Chapter 35: Safety Services
            Some installations may require standby (back-up) supplies so that power is
            maintained in the event of an emergency. Standby supplies could be necessary for
            water pumps, in order to operate sprinkler systems, or for fire-detection systems.
            The designer must assess how these standby supplies will be provided. Options
            include the use of generators and batteries.

            Chapter 36: Continuity of Services
            Some circuits require a continuous supply of electricity. An example is circuits
            for life-support systems. A designer must assess how electricity to these circuits
            will be maintained in the event of an emergency. A possibility is an uninterrupted
            power supply (UPS) on that circuit. Another option may be the use of an impeded
            earth (IT) earthing system and monitors instead of circuit breakers, meaning the
            supply will not disconnect in the event of a fault.

            such as a terminal in a light switch. To protect against electric shock, Section 416
            states that every terminal must be housed in an enclosure that is secured and can
            only be accessed by using a tool. This means that – assuming the light switch is
            not damaged – the only way someone can get a shock from a terminal is by using
            a screwdriver to get to it!
            The four main risks associated with electricity are:
            ●    electric shock (Chapter 41)
            ●    fire or heat, known as thermal effects (Chapter 42)
            ●    overcurrent, such as short circuits (Chapter 43)
            ●    voltage disturbances, such as lightning strikes, and electromagnetic
                 interference (Chapter 44).
            An assessment of the risks associated with each of the above will lead to the need
            for isolation and switching (Chapter 46).

            Chapter 41: Protection Against Electric Shock
            Before considering the requirements for protection against electric shock, you will
            need to recall how an electric shock can be received.

                                            Defining ‘electricity’
                                            Revise your basic understanding of what electricity is.
                                            ●   Voltage is the pressure that pushes current around a circuit (and into the
                                                human body).
                                            ●   Current is the quantity of electricity that makes things happen (such as
                                                muscle reaction).
                                            ●   Resistance is the opposition against the current flow. Resistance also causes
                                                voltage loss in circuits or across loads.
                                            Consider this. If you tested the insulation resistance of a shoe, worn by someone
                                            standing on a wooden floor, to the electrical earth using an insulation resistance
                                            tester set to 250 V, what would be the expected resistance? It would probably be
                                            above 200 MΩ (which is 200 000 000 Ω). So, applying Ohm’s law:

                                                    250
                                                              = 1.25 × 10 –6 A or 1.25  A or 0.000 001 25 A
                                                200 000 000
              HEALTH AND SAFETY
              Probably not – there is       Ask yourself, if the person wearing the shoe touched, with their hand, a live part,
              still a risk, so do not,
                                            would that current be enough to cause a serious electric shock? Probably not but
              under any circumstances,
              try this.                     the person may feel it and know that they are in contact with electricity.
                                            Imagine if that same person was also touching something in contact with earth
                                            or standing on the Earth (with one leg). The resistance would fall, and electric

                                                Earthing is intended to carry a fault current and form part of the overall earth fault
                                                loop path. It should have a low enough resistance to ensure that a high enough
                                                fault current occurs, to aid quick disconnection of protective devices.
                                                Bonding is intended to transfer a voltage and not necessarily carry fault current.
                                                By bonding a metallic gas pipe to the electrical installation earth, should
                                                something electrical become faulty and therefore live to 230 V, so too should
                                                the gas pipe, equalising the voltage. So, the potential difference between earthed
                                                parts and bonded parts is as near to 0 V as possible (equipotential).
                                                Amendment 2 of BS 7671: 2018 (2022) is now worded to imply that main
                                                protective bonding is required for every building supplied by a single electrical
                                                installation or, in the case of a block of flats, every electrical installation within a
                                                building.

                                                Disconnection times
                         INDUSTRY TIP           Also contained in subsection 411.3 are the required disconnection times in the
                                                case of a fault to earth.
              Single-phase 230 V circuits       Table 41.1 in BS 7671: 2018 (2022) applies to:
              and three-phase 400 V

                         INDUSTRY TIP           It states that for circuits on a system supplied with a nominal voltage to earth
                                                (U0) of 230 V, disconnection must occur within, depending on the earthing
              A note under Table 41.1           arrangement:
              in BS 7671 indicates that
              disconnection as TN is            ●   TT – 0.2 seconds
              permitted for a TT installation   ●   TN – 0.4 seconds.
              where everything is bonded        Any circuit not covered by Table 41.1, and any distribution circuit, must disconnect
              in accordance with 411.3.1.2      within:
              and suitable circuit protection
              is provided, such as a            ●   five seconds, in the case of a TN system
              domestic farmhouse.               ●   one second, in the case of a TT system.

                                                Additional requirements
                                                In addition to the stated disconnection times, some circuits require additional
                                                protection by means of a residual current device (RCD). The reason for this is
                                                because of the risk of damage to the basic protection, such as insulation.
                                                Additional protection by means of an RCD with a rated current not exceeding
                                                30 mA must be provided in the following situations:
                                                ●   socket outlets with a rated current not exceeding 32 A and used by Ordinary

                                                ●   mobile equipment with a rated current not exceeding 32 A used outdoors
                                                ●   circuits supplying luminaires within domestic installations.

            In these situations, there is a greater risk of damage to the insulation. For example:
            ●     appliances plugged into socket outlets may be poorly maintained and have
                  damaged insulation
            ●     extension leads are more prone to damage when supplying lawnmowers and
                  similar equipment
            ●     damage to insulation in tight metallic housings from heat produced by lamps,
                  such as decorative metal luminaires.

                                               As TT systems rely on the general mass of earth as part of their earth return path,

                                               to ensure that in the case of a fault, the RCD trips, based on the earth electrode
                                               resistance, before the voltage on any earthing rises above 50 V.
                                               So, for an example using Table 41.5, if an earth electrode had a resistance of
                                               125 Ω, this resistance is above 100 Ω but below 167 Ω, so a 300 mA RCD would
                                               provide the protection needed.

                                               supply on 110 V site supply systems and the need for disconnection time to be
                                               within five seconds. To achieve this, values of earth fault loop impedance should
                                               not exceed those in Table 41.6.

                                               layer of insulation and a further layer of insulation, which should prevent faults

                                               Section 415
                                               This section deals with the requirements where additional protection is needed.
                                               Additional protection may be in addition to basic protection, in the case of an
                                               RCD, or by supplementary equipotential bonding, in the case of fault protection.
                                               Where an RCD is required for additional protection, the rated residual current of
                                               the device should not exceed 30 mA.
                                               In less common situations, where disconnection times cannot be met and
                                               the use of an RCD would not be suitable due to the risk of nuisance tripping,
                                               supplementary bonding is applied. This is installed to ensure that equal voltages
                                               (equipotential) exist between the equipment under fault and any extraneous parts
                                               within touching distance.

                                               Section 416
                                               Section 416 deals with the requirements for basic protection, achieved through:
                                               ●   basic insulation; or
                                               ●   barriers and enclosures.

                                               Basic insulation
                                               Regulation 416.1 states that live parts shall be completely covered with insulation
                                               that can only be removed by destruction. However, not all insulating materials are
                                               suitable for providing basic protection. Varnish and lacquer, for example, perform
                                               an insulating function when used on windings, but Regulation 416.1 states:
                                                   ‘Paint, varnish, lacquer or similar products are generally not considered
                                                   to provide adequate insulation for basic protection in normal service.’

                                               Barriers and enclosures
                                               Not all live parts can be covered in insulation because they may need to move or
                                               be terminated. The easier option, therefore, is to put live parts that may need to
                                               move or be terminated, inside a box; that is, an enclosure.
                                               When an enclosure is used, it is important to ensure that any holes in the
                                               enclosure do not present a risk from electric shock. Regulation 416.2.1 states that
                                               holes in the enclosure should meet the minimum requirements of IPXXB or IP2X.
                         INDUSTRY TIP
                                               This means that no hole or opening in the enclosure can be larger than 12 mm
              An IP code gives the level       in diameter when the enclosure is in normal use. IPXXB takes the requirements a
              of ingress protection that a     little bit further, as this IP code states that protection must be against an object
              barrier or enclosure provides.   that is not only to be smaller than 12 mm in diameter but also up to 80 mm long,
                                               with two 90° joints.
                                               Table 3.3 explains all the IP codes that you may come across when working on
                                               electrical systems and equipment.

            When the enclosure is mounted in a position where the top is accessible, then
            BS 7671 increases the level of protection required. Regulation 416.2.2 states that
            accessible top surfaces of enclosures need to be to IPXXD or IP4X. This higher level
            of IP code means that items measuring 1 mm in diameter or more will not be able
            to enter the opening. The IPXXD code means that an object 1 mm in diameter that
            is 100 mm long should not come into contact with live parts. Where an internal
            barrier is to be used, then this must comply with the IP codes of IPXXB or IP2X.
            Removal of a barrier must only be achieved by using a key or tool, or by
            destruction.

                                           Obstacles
                                           Unlike basic insulation, barriers or enclosures, the sole use of obstacles as a
                                           means of basic protection is only permitted in installations that are controlled
                                           or supervised by a competent or skilled person. The note under the heading
                                           of Section 417.2 in BS 7671 says that the purpose of obstacles is to prevent
                                           unintentional contact with live parts, but obstacles are not intended to prevent
                                           deliberate actions to cause contact with live parts.
                                           Obstacles can be removed without the need to use a key or tool or destruction.
                                           There is also no specification as to the level of IP rating that is required, as
                                           penetration of the obstacle would be a deliberate act performed with the
                                           intention of touching something live.

                                           Placing out of reach
                                           As with obstacles, the protective measure of placing out of reach can only be used
                                           when the circuits are under the control or supervision of a competent or skilled

            Section 422
            This section of BS 7671 covers:
            ●    electrical installations in protected escape routes
            ●    installations with a higher risk of fire owing to the storage or production of
                 combustible material.
            The risk with escape routes is where electrical equipment encroaches onto the
            route causing trip, snag or smoke issues.

            Within some types of BS 88 fuse, usually the bolted type,
            there may be more than one element. The purpose of this
            is to minimise the energy from a single explosion, should
            the fuse be subjected to high fault currents. Instead there
            will be several smaller explosions, allowing these devices to
            handle much higher fault currents of up to 80 kA.
            Other BS 88 devices may be the clipped type, which do not
            have the two bolt tags. They are simply barrel shaped and
            slot into place in the carrier. They are often called cartridge
            fuses.
            Another type of cartridge fuse is the BS 1362 plug fuse.
            This fuse is fitted into 13 A plugs and is available in a range
            of ratings. Typical ratings are 3 A, 5 A and 13 A.                    Figure 3.12 BS 88 bolted-type fuse

            Circuit breakers
            Circuit breakers (CBs) have several ratings.
            ●    In is the nominal current rating. This is the current that the device can carry
                 without disconnection, and without reducing the expected life of the device.
            ●    Ia is the disconnection current. This is the value of current that will cause the
                 disconnection of the device in a given time.
            ●    Icn is the value of fault current above which there is a danger of the device
                 exploding or, worse, welding the contacts together.
            ●    Ics is the value of fault current that the device can handle and remain serviceable.
            Circuit breakers are thermomagnetic devices capable of making, carrying and
            interrupting currents under normal and abnormal conditions. They fall into two
            categories:
            ●    miniature circuit breakers (MCBs), which are common in most installations for
                 the protection of final circuits
            ●    moulded-case circuit breakers (MCCBs), which are normally used for larger
                 distribution circuits.
            Both types work on the same principle. They have a magnetic trip and an overload
            trip, which is usually a bimetallic strip. If a CB is subjected to overload current, the
            bimetallic strip bends due to the heating effect of the overcurrent. The bent strip
            eventually trips the switch, although this can take considerable time, depending
            on the level of overload.

            Miniature circuit breakers
            These thermomagnetic devices have different characteristics depending on their
            manufacture. They generally have a lower prospective short-circuit current rating
            than a high-rupturing capacity (HRC) fuse, ranging from approximately
            6 kA to 10 kA. Specialist units are available for higher values.
            The operating characteristics of MCBs can be shown in graphical form by a time–

                                                       Miniature circuit breakers are generally faster acting than the standard curve
                                                       in BS 88 fuses. A CB has a curve, then a straight line, whereas the BS 88 fuse
                                                       is fully curved. This demonstrates the two tripping mechanisms in a CB. The
                                                       magnetic trip is represented by the straight line on the graph, indicating that a
                                                       predetermined value of fault current will disconnect the device rapidly.
                                                       The curve represents the device’s thermal mechanism. Like a fuse, the thermal
                                                       mechanism reacts within a time specific to the overload current. The bigger the
                                                       overload, the faster the reaction.

                                                       moulded-case construction and physical size of MCCBs gives them much higher
                                                       breaking capacity ratings than those of MCBs. Many MCCBs have adjustable
                                                       current settings.

            Residual current devices and
            residual current circuit breakers
            with overload
            Residual current devices (RCDs) operate
            by monitoring the current in both the
            line and neutral conductors of a circuit.
            If the circuit is healthy with no earth
            faults, the toroidal core inside the device
            remains balanced with no magnetic flux
            flow. If a residual earth fault occurs in        Time
            the circuit, slightly more current flows      (seconds)
            in the line conductor compared with the
            neutral. If this imbalance exceeds the
            residual current setting of the device, the
            flux flowing in the core is sensed by the
            sensing coil, which induces a current to a
            solenoid, tripping the device.
            Residual current breakers with overload
            (RCBOs) combine an overcurrent
            protective device with an RCD in the
            body of the CB.
            Unlike CBs, both RCDs and RCBOs
            have a test button, which should be                                             Prospective fault current

            trip a CB is large enough to free any
            seized parts. As RCDs and RCBOs operate under earth fault
            conditions with relatively small residual currents, there may
            not be enough energy to free any seized parts.

            Unlike most other protective devices, the BS 3036 fuse                                                             Flux flow when

            of oxidation on the element and how the arrangement has
            been installed (e.g. whether it was badly tightened, open to air
            movement).                                                           Sensing

                                                 part of the device trips. The different types are selected to suit loads where
                                                 particular inrush currents are expected.
                                                 Type B MCBs trip between three and five times the rated current (3 to
                                                 5 × In). These MCBs are normally used for domestic circuits and commercial
                                                 applications where there is no inrush current to cause them to trip. For example,
                                                 the magnetic tripping current in a 32 A Type B CB could be 160 A, so Ia = 5 × In.
                                                 These MCBs are used where maximum protection is required and therefore should
                                                 be the choice for general socket-outlet applications.
                                                 Type C MCBs trip between five and ten times the rated current (5 to 10 × In).
                                                 These MCBs are normally used for commercial applications where there are small
                                                 to medium motors or fluorescent luminaires and where there is some inrush
                                                 current that would cause the CB to trip. For example, the magnetic tripping
                                                 current in a 32 A Type C CB could be 320 A, so Ia = 10 × In.
                                                 Type D MCBs trip between ten and twenty times the rated current (10 to 20 × In).
                                                 These MCBs are for specific industrial applications where there are large inrushes
                                                 of current for industrial motors, X-ray units, welding equipment, etc. For example,
                                                 the magnetic trip in a 32 A Type D CB could be 640 A, so Ia = 20 × In.

                                                 Moulded-case circuit breakers are available in various ranges. Lower-cost, simpler
                                                 versions are thermomagnetic with no adjustment. Other devices have electronic
                                                 trip units and sensitivity settings or the ability to be de-rated.
                                                 Most MCCBs are used on larger circuits or distribution circuits where larger
                                                 prospective short circuits are likely but the flexibility of an electronic trip is
                                                 also required.

            Short-circuit breaking capacities
            One of the greatest considerations when selecting a protective device for any
            installation is the suitability of the device to disconnect a fault current safely. If a
            fault current exceeds the breaking capacity of a protective device, the device may:
            ●    explode, causing a risk of fire or burns
            ●    damage the internal components, making the device inoperable in the case
                 of CBs
            ●    weld contacts together, so the device will not interrupt the fault current.
            It is essential that designers of electrical installations select protective devices
            that have a rated short-circuit capacity or breaking capacity greater than the
            prospective fault current (Ipf) for that part of the electrical installation.
            Table 3.4 shows the rated short-circuit capacities of commonly used protective
            devices.

              and a circuit disconnects    much less current – circuits, such as traditional 32 A ring-final circuits for the

                                            The intention is to prove that a protective device will disconnect before the
                                            time (t ) is reached, therefore protecting the circuit from overheating beyond the
                                            cable’s permitted final temperature.
                                            Below are the steps we can take to calculate the disconnection time for short circuits.
                                            Step 1
                                            Determine the circuit R1 + RN, which is the resistance of the line–neutral loop of

                                            equation).
                                            Step 2
                                            Determine the supply line–neutral loop impedance. This may be done by
                                            measurement or calculation or enquiry.

              Step 3
              Add the supply line–neutral loop impedance to the R1 + RN to determine the
              overall short-circuit impedance, so
                  Total short-circuit impedance = Zsupply + R1 + R N
              This impedance can then be used to determine the actual short-circuit current
              Ipscc using Ohm’s law. This value of current would represent I in the adiabatic
              equation.
              Step 4
              From Table 43.1 in BS 7671, find the value of k based on the type of insulation.
              Step 5
              Using the values obtained, determine the value t using the adiabatic equation.

              t = 2 in seconds
                   I
              Step 6
              Using Appendix 3 of BS 7671, check how quickly the particular protective
              device will disconnect, using the current I current characteristic graph for that
              particular device and rating. Finally, the value t from the equation must be
              greater than the time taken for disconnection for the circuit to be adequately
              protected.


              IMPROVE YOUR MATHS
              Calculating disconnection time for short circuits: example
              A 230 V single-phase final circuit is wired using flat-profile 70°C thermoplastic
              twin and cpc cable with 1.5/1.0 mm2 copper conductors to a length of 25 m.
              The circuit is protected by a 10 A Type C circuit breaker. The supply line–neutral
              loop impedance is 0.4 Ω.
              Determine if the circuit has adequate short-circuit protection.
              Step 1
              ●   Determine R1 + RN using Tables I1 and I3 in the IET On-Site Guide.
              ●   From Table I1, the resistance for a 1.5/1.5 mm2 (live conductors) combination
                  is 24.20 mΩ/m at 20°C. From Table I3, the factor of 1.2 is used as the cable
                  is fully incorporated, so
                    24.2 × 25 × 1.2
                                      = 0.73 Ω at operating temperature 70°C
                         1000
              Step 2
              So, the total short-circuit impedance is
                  Supply impedance + R1 + R N, so:

                  0.4 + 0.73 = 1.13 Ω

              Step 3
              Therefore, the short-circuit current, using Ohm’s law, would be:
                  230
                       = 203.54 A

                                               Step 4
                                               From Table 43.1 in BS 7671, the value of k is 115 and, as previously found:
                                                  I = 203.54 and S = 1.5
                                               Now use these values in the adiabatic equation:
                                                        1.52 × 1152
                                                  t=                  = 0.72 seconds
                                                          203.542
                                               This means that the cable would take 0.72 seconds to reach a temperature of
                                               160°C and the insulation would begin to melt.
                                               Step 5
                                               Using the graphs in Appendix 3 of BS 7671, the time taken to disconnect a 10
                                               A Type C circuit breaker is < 0.1 seconds.


                                               As the device trips before the cable melts, this is a safe circuit.



                                           Current coordination
                                           For a circuit to comply with the requirements in Chapter 43 of BS 7671, it must
                                           be correctly coordinated. This means that the protective device rating is suitable
                                           for the design current and the cable has a current capacity that is suitable for
                                           the protective device. In short, a correctly coordinated circuit should meet the
                                           following:
                                                 Ib ≤ I n ≤ I z

                                           ●     In is the rating of the protective device
                                           ●     Iz is the current-carrying capacity of the conductor based on installed
                                                 conditions.
                                           If, on a rare occasion, a circuit may be reasonably subjected to overloads, then:
                                                 Iz ≥ 1.45 × In

                                           So in a normal circuit where overloads are not expected, the circuit should be
                                           coordinated, such as in the following example.

                                           Current coordination: example
                                           If we had a circuit that:
                                           ●     had a design current of 14 A
                                           ●     was protected by a 16 A device
                                           ●     had a circuit cable with a current-carrying capacity, after consideration of the
                                                 installed conditions, of 24 A,
                                           then this could be expressed as:
                                                 Ib = 14 A < In = 16 A < Iz = 24 A

            But if that circuit was liable to overloads, then:
                 16 × 1.45 = 23.2 A < 24 A Iz

            In this situation, the circuit would also have capabilities for any potential short-
            term overloads.
            The reason for the 1.45 factor is that most protective devices would not
            reasonably disconnect at a current less than this. A quick look at Appendix 3
            in BS 7671 shows that a 16 A Type B circuit breaker would not disconnect until
            approximately 23 A is reached. Even then, it would take 10 000 seconds, which is
            approximately 2 hours 45 minutes.
            As long as the cable is capable of this current, it will not overheat.

            Short-circuit capacity
            In Chapter 43 of BS 7671, Regulation 434.5.1 requires that the rated short-circuit or
            breaking capacity of each protective device shall not be less than the prospective
            fault current at that part of the installation.
            This regulation is the reason we test prospective fault current during an initial

            Most of Chapter 44 in BS 7671 is devoted to specialist design work. We will look
            at sections of this chapter that are relevant to most installations and one area
            specific to broadband and WiFi.
            Chapter 44 has four sections:
            ●    Section 442 – Protection of low-voltage installations against temporary
                 overvoltages due to earth faults in the high-voltage system and faults in the
                 low-voltage system
            ●    Section 443 – Protection against overvoltages of atmospheric origin
            ●    Section 444 – Measures against electromagnetic disturbances
            ●    Section 445 – Protection against undervoltages.

            Section 442
            In this section, BS 7671 provides requirements for the design and installation of
            substation transformer systems. If you recall coverage of supply and distribution
            systems from your science studies, some installations are supplied at 33 kV or
            11 kV. In these situations, the consumer is responsible for the substation, and
            Section 442 gives detailed requirements for this.

            Section 443
            Section 443 gives requirements for installations and networks where a voltage
            disturbance of atmospheric origin is a risk. In simple terms, that means

                                               origin needs to be able to withstand high-voltage surges. Table 443.2 in BS 7671
                                               gives the withstand rating of that equipment depending on the risk.

            ●    isolation
            ●    functional switching
            ●    switching off for mechanical maintenance
            ●    emergency switching.
            Other devices may be used for the purpose of firefighters’ switching; see Chapter
            53 in BS 7671.

            Section 461
            This section states that a protective earth and neutral (PEN) conductor shall not
            be switched. If a PEN conductor were to be switched, then an installation would
            lose its earthing.
            Section 461 also states that, providing the earthing arrangement is a TN system,
            a neutral does not require isolation (except where stated in Section 462). It is
            common to see three-pole switches controlling three-phase installations where
            the neutral may be isolated by a mechanical link inside the distribution board.

            Chapter 51: Common Rules
            As the name suggests, this chapter includes the rules that apply to all electrical
            installations. Consider the potential consequences if we did not standardise the
            colours we use to identify conductors in all electrical circuits. Non-standardisation
            could lead to some very dangerous situations.

            Section 511
            This section states that any equipment selected must comply with the relevant
            British Standard. If the equipment does not hold a British Standard, then the
            designer must verify that the equipment is of a similar standard to BS Standards,
            so has the same level of safety.

            Section 512

            The most common practice when installing cables through joists is to drill holes
            along the centre of the depth of the joist and to make sure that the top or bottom
            of the hole is more than 50 mm from the edge of the joist. Section 7.3.1 of the
            IET On-Site Guide (OSG) provides further guidance on the drilling of joists or the
            cutting of notches. The OSG takes into account the requirements of the Building
            Regulations with regards to the size, quantity and location of holes in joists.

            Not many people damage cables installed in floor or ceiling spaces. People are
            most likely to damage a cable when they are mounting something on a wall.
            Section 522.6 identifies the measures that should be taken to protect the cable
            from damage when it is installed within a wall at a depth of 50 mm or less from
            the surface. These requirements are that the cable:
            ●    be run in either steel-wire armoured (SWA) or mineral insulated (MI) cables
                 with the armour or sheath connected to earth; or
            ●    be run in steel conduit, which is then also connected to earth; or
            ●    be run in steel trunking or ducting, which is then also connected to earth; or
            ●    have additional mechanical protection to prevent nails and screws from
                 penetrating the cable; or
            ●    be run in prescribed zones of protection that extend 150 mm down from the
                 ceiling or run in a location that falls within the width of the accessory from
                 floor to ceiling, or the height of the accessory for the length of the wall; or
            ●    be either a SELV or a PELV circuit.

                                             The first option of using SWA or MI cable is not often considered, because of the
                                             additional costs associated with installing special cables. As SWA and MI cables
                                             would offer a higher-than-normal level of mechanical protection anyway, they are
                                             normally surface mounted.

                                             thickness vertically. When the chasing is performed in a cavity wall, the thickness
                                             is that of the leaf of the wall, which is typically 100 mm. The result is that chasing
                                             cannot be deeper than 16.67 mm when running horizontally and 33.33 mm when

            Regulation subsection 522.8 deals with the other stresses and strains to which a
            cable may be subjected. This includes the strain that can come from the weight
            of the cable itself. Copper is a reasonably heavy material, but it is also soft, which
            means if the cable is not supported correctly, then the copper will stretch. This
            will result in the csa of the copper conductors becoming smaller, which can cause
            the cable to get hot or even break. Regulation 522.8.4 states:
                 ‘Where the conductors or cables are not supported continuously due to
                 the method of installation, they shall be supported by suitable means at
                 appropriate intervals in such a manner that the conductors or cables do
                 not suffer damage by their own weight.’
            This means that when cables are installed using cable clips or cleats, then the
            clips and cleats must be at ‘appropriate’ intervals. The IET OSG provides guidance
            on what is deemed to be ‘appropriate’ within Appendix D, specifically in Table D1
            (reproduced as Table 3.5, below).

                                                    One common area where this matter also needs to be considered is when wiring
                                                    is installed within vertical trunking, as the weight of the wiring itself will cause it
                                                    to stretch. If the top bend is a right angle, then the cable’s weight will be applied
                                                    at the edge of the trunking, causing it to cut into the wiring. On long drops it
                                                    is common to install support pins within the trunking, with the wiring woven
                                                    between the pins, which helps to provide support to the cables.
                                                    Another source of stress and strain that cables encounter is when they are bent
                                                    too tightly, causing pressure to be applied not only to the conductors, but also
                                                    to the insulation of the cable. In the case of PVC-insulated cables, when the
                                                    conductors carry the load current and get hot, this will warm the PVC, making the
                                                    insulation soft and easy to split. With the added pressure of the bend, the copper
                                                    conductors can easily cut through the softened insulation, causing a fault to occur.
                                                    Regulation 522.8.3 states:
                                                        ‘The radius of every bend in a wiring system shall be such that conductors
                                                        or cables do not suffer damage and terminations are not stressed.’
                                                    When planning the route of a cable, consideration needs to be given to the
                                                    number and tightness of the bends. Appendix D in the IET OSG, specifically Table
                                                    D5 (reproduced as Table 3.6, below), gives guidance on the minimum bend radius
                                                    of cables to ensure they are not subjected to undue stress and strain.

                                                    All of these considerations will have an impact, not only on the type of cables

            When a conductor is installed, several factors have an impact on the
            temperature of the conductor and the cable itself. A conductor’s primary
            function is to carry electrical energy from the source to the destination. If the
            opposition to the flow of the electrical energy (the resistance) is too great, then
            insufficient energy will reach the load in order for it to function correctly.
            Resistance is affected not only by the material, its length and its area, but also by
            temperature. If temperature is not considered during the design and installation
            stages, then the conductor may well become undersized and in turn will overheat.
            Like a person doing physical exercise, a conductor has three things that can stop it
            cooling. These are:
            ●    the surrounding ambient temperature
            ●    the closeness of other heat sources, such as other loaded cables
            ●    being wrapped in thermally insulating material.
            These three main factors must be considered when selecting a conductor size.
            Section 532 of BS 7671 states that Appendix 4 should be used to size conductors.
            A series of tables in Appendix 4 identifies correction factors that are applied to the
            current rating of the circuit being designed, based on the rating of the protective
            device. These correction factors include:

            Looking at Appendix 3 in BS 7671, we can see that a 32 A Type D circuit breaker
            will disconnect at a current of 640 A, whereas a 100 A Type B will disconnect at
            500 A fault current. This means that the 100 A device will disconnect before the
            32 A device.

                Any smaller csa would cause the cable to exceed its ‘final limiting temperature’
                and fail. The adiabatic equation is as follows:

                            I2t
                     S=         in mm2
                            k
                Where:
                ● S is the minimum acceptable size of cpc for the expected earth fault current

                ● I is the actual fault current based on the total earth fault loop impedance (Zs)

                ● t is the actual disconnection time, using the graphs in Appendix 3

                ● K is the factor from Tables 54.2–54.5 in BS 7671, depending on how the
                  cpc is installed.
                Using the adiabatic equation step by step
                1    Calculate the R1 + R2 for the circuit.
                2    Determine the total earth fault loop impedance (Zs).
                3    Determine the actual earth fault current, using Ohm’s law.
                4    Use the graphs in Appendix 3 to work out the actual disconnection time
                     (down to 0.1 seconds).

                                            5 Determine the factor k from the following tables in BS 7671:
                                              ● Table 54.2, where the cpc is not incorporated in a cable or bunched.
                                                 Examples may be the separate earthing conductor for an installation, the
                                                 sheath of a mineral-insulated copper-clad (MICC) cable and a separate
                                                 overlay cpc tagged to a steel-wired armour (SWA) cable.
                                              ● Table 54.3, where the cpc is bunched or a core within a cable.

                                              ● Table 54.4, where the armouring of an SWA cable is used as a cpc.

                                              ● Table 54.5, where a containment, such as conduit or trunking, is used
                                                 as a cpc.
                                            6 Apply the adiabatic equation:

                                                          I2t
                                                S=            in mm2
                                                          k

                                               If the value from the equation in mm2 is smaller than the actual cpc csa, then
                                               the circuit is acceptable.
                                            Adiabatic equation: example
                                            A 230 V single-phase circuit is wired using 70°C thermoplastic flat-profile twin
                                            and cpc cable having 2.5/2.5 mm2 copper conductors to a length of 43 m. The
                                            supply earth fault loop impedance (Ze) is 0.1 Ω. Protection is by a 20 A Type C
                                            circuit breaker.
                                            Using Table I1 in the IET On-Site Guide, a 2.5/2.5 mm2 combination of
                                            conductor has a resistance of 14.82 mΩ/m at 20°C. Using Table I3, a factor of
                                            1.2 is selected to allow for operating temperatures.
                                            To calculate R1 + R2

                                            So, Zs is:
                                               0.1 + 0.76 = 0.86 Ω
                                            And therefore the fault current would be:
                                                230
                                                         = 267 A
                                                0.86

              The cpc is a core within a                     115
              70°C thermoplastic multi-
              core cable.                   As the cpc is actually 2.5 mm2, this is acceptable.

            Section 544
            This section deals with the csa and connection of bonding conductors. Note that
            the bonding conductors for a protective multiple earthing (PME) system must be
            larger than those of TN-S or TT.
            BS 7671: 2018 (2022) now requires each building to have its own main protective
            bonding rather than each installation, which may have covered several buildings.
            In addition, if a building has several electrical installations, such as a block of
            flats, each installation requires main protective bonding. In these situations, the
            bonding is sized in accordance with the distribution circuit cable supplying that
            installation or building.
            Regulation 544.1.2 states that where the bonding connection is made, metallic
            pipework, such as gas and water, must be bonded at the point of entry. Alternatively,

                                                 There are two chapters in Part 6 of BS 7671. These are:

                                                     of periodic inspections.

                                                 OR LOCATIONS
                                                 When electrical installations are designed and installed, it is important to bear
                                                 in mind that, although standard external influences must be considered when
                                                 selecting and erecting equipment, not all installations are the same. In fact, not all
                                                 parts of an installation may be the same. BS 7671: 2018 recognises that, in some
                                                 areas of an installation, there is a higher risk of electric shock due to the nature of
                                                 the location or type of installation.
                                                 BS 7671: 2018 identifies these locations and installations as ‘special’ and Part 7
                                                 lists them. When considering the work to be performed in a special location,
                                                 or a special installation, it is important to understand the special requirements
                                                 in terms of the international protection (IP) code ratings and changes to the

            Zones
            A room containing a bath or shower has different levels of risk of electric shock
            in different areas of the location. BS 7671 splits the room up into different areas,
            based on the different levels of risk. These areas are called zones and can be
            simplified as shown in Table 3.8 (below).
             Table 3.8 Zones according to BS 7671
              Zone       Description
              0          This is the area where the water is held and it can be any size or shape, depending
                                                                                                                               INDUSTRY TIP
                         on the size and shape of the bath or basin.
                                                                                                                        Section 701 contains
              1          This is the area of the perimeter of the bath or basin from the floor to a maximum
                                                                                                                        diagrams showing the zones.
                         height of 2.25 m. This would be the area occupied by a person if they were sitting or
                         standing in zone 0.
              2          This is the area immediately outside the perimeter of the bath or basin to a distance
                         of 0.6 m from the bath or basin, to a maximum height of 2.25 m. This is the area
                         that can be reached by extending an arm while sitting or standing in zone 0.


            In some instances, there may be a shower with no basin, for example, in a wet
            room or the showers at a sports gym. The zones in such circumstances are further
            clarified in BS 7671, in Figures 701.1 and 701.2. If a shower head is installed at a
            height greater than 2.25 m from the floor, then the height of zones 1 and 2 will be
            increased to the height of the shower head.

            Selection of equipment
            Because the location has been split into zones based on risk, each zone has
            different requirements with regards to the equipment that can be installed.
            The main focus in this location is the presence of water and so the IP ratings of
            equipment and accessories are important.

              HEALTH AND SAFETY            Other key points to consider
              Consider why the distance    ●   When performing electrical installations within a location containing a bath or
              from the edge of the bath        shower, all circuits within the location need to be RCD-protected, in
              to any 230 V, 13 A socket        accordance with Regulation 701.411.3.3. This requires an RCD with a maximum
              outlet is 2.5 m. What            rating of 30 mA.

              similar appliance.           ●   However, Regulation 701.415.2 makes it clear that equipotential bonding
                                               between all exposed metal work is not always required if the installation is
                                               within a location which already has main protective bonding installed. In order
                                               to omit supplementary equipotential bonding, three criteria must be met.
                                               These criteria are:
                                               ● all final circuits within the location must meet the maximum disconnection

                                                   times stated within Table 41.1 of BS 7671: 2018 by having an earth fault
                                                   loop impedance, Zs, within the limits specified in Tables 41.2 to 41.4, and
                                               ● all final circuits of the installation must have additional protection in the

                                                   form of an RCD, and
                                               ● all extraneous conductive parts must be effectively connected to the main

                                                   protective bonding.
                                               The first two requirements are quite simple to establish but the third option
                                               requires a confirmation by testing. Using continuity test method 2 (from
                                               Guidance Note 3), the resistance between the metal part of the location and
                                               the MET can be measured. If the reading is low enough, then supplementary
                                               equipotential bonding is not required. The note below Regulation 701.415.2
                                               identifies how to establish this. On a 30 mA RCD, the maximum resistance
                                               before supplementary bonding is required is 1667 Ω. If a reading above this
                                               value is obtained, then supplementary equipotential bonding is required. If a
                                               reading above 1 MΩ is obtained, then it can be confirmed that supplementary
                                               equipotential bonding is not required as the metal part of the location is
                                               insulated from earth and therefore is not an extraneous conductive part.

                                           Other special locations
                                           As mentioned earlier, BS 7671 covers many other special locations and

            Each special installation or location requires careful consideration with regards to
            how the installation is designed and installed. It is important for both the designer
            and installer to be familiar with the additional special requirements as specified in
            the relevant section of BS 7671.
            Common key points to consider include the requirements for a higher level of
            IP rating than normal, the provision of additional protection by supplementary
            equipotential bonding and RCDs, and the use of SELV or PELV with restricted
            values.


            PART 8: FUNCTIONAL
            REQUIREMENTS
            Every edition and amendment of BS 7671 up to the year 2022 has only contained
            requirements that uphold the Fundamental Principles for safety as set out in
            Chapter 13.
            As technology advances, there is more of a need to include requirements leading
            to the correct function of electrical installations and equipment. As a result, Part 8
            has been introduced into BS 7671.

            Chapter 82: Prosumers’ low-voltage
            electrical installations
            This is an entirely new chapter introduced into BS 7671:2018 (2022). Since
            electricity was first delivered to buildings by a supply network, utility companies
            have managed the public transmission and distribution network by having
            generators coming on- and offline to suit the national demand variations.
            The purpose of this Chapter is to provide requirements so that electrical
            installations are suitable with the current and future ways of delivering electrical
            energy to current-using equipment, either from the public supply network, or
            from other local sources such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays on a house, a micro-

                                             as well as its own generator or electricity storage systems

                                           Chapter 82 introduces some new terminology into BS 7671 such as:
                                           ●   prosumer: someone who both consumes (uses) electricity from the supply
                                               network and produces electricity either for their own consumption, or to feed
                                               into the public network.
                                           ●   island mode: an operating mode where a prosumer’s electrical installation is
                                               disconnected from the public supply network but remains energised by the
                                               electricity being generated or stored locally within the electrical installation.
                                           ●   load shedding: a system of energy management where appliances and other
                                               loads are controlled to suit times of peak demand, reducing consumption from
                                               the public supply network.

            WORKING ON SITE




               INTRODUCTION
               Organising and overseeing the workplace environment is a skill expected of most qualified electricians. Many
               electricians are expected to be able to plan electrical installation work, from the initial contact with the client,
               through supervising others during the construction stage, to final handover to the client. For large contracts,
               these tasks might involve more than one person. For the majority of electrical installation work in the UK,
               however, one person will carry them out.
               The key to success within the electrotechnical industry is the ability to plan and supervise effectively. Careful
               planning will minimise any surprises during the work and lead to timely completion with little or no additional
               cost. Effective supervision will lead to reduced wastage of time and materials. Each will lead to good customer
               relationships, improved company image and, very importantly, a motivated and contented workforce.
               Above all else, good planning promotes safety.

                                               It is essential that equipment is fit for purpose. Before any equipment is
                                               purchased, the buyer must check the product specification. Many manufacturers
                                               will provide this information free of charge, either in the form of a printed
                                               catalogue or data sheet, or electronically as a web page or downloadable file.
                                               In rare situations, manufacturers will only provide this information following the

                                                   of connecting cables and terminating the conductors. This, in turn, affects the

                                                   form of a description or, in the case of lighting, photometric data.

                                               ●   Suitability for the environment – helps you determine whether the product
                                                   has a suitable international protection (IP) code rating or protection for the
                                                   intended environment.
                                               ●   Temperature – helps you determine whether the product will pose a fire risk
                                                   due to high operating temperatures, and whether the product is affected by
                                                   the location’s ambient temperature.
                                               All of the above information must be carefully scrutinised before any product is
                                               purchased, as an incorrect product could be costly to replace or modify.

                                               Installation instructions
                                               All but the simplest products will have installation instructions. These are normally
                                               packed with the product but may be available from the manufacturer before the
                                               product is purchased. The installation instructions will normally provide key detail,
                                               such as suitable methods of fixing and how to connect the product.
                                               A very important factor to note is that the manufacturer’s instructions will normally
                                               supersede the requirements of BS 7671. An example of this could be that a
                                               manufacturer stipulates that a particular product should be protected by a 30 mA
                                               residual current device (RCD), yet BS 7671 may not require the particular product or
                                               circuit to be protected by an RCD. In this situation, the manufacturer’s instructions
                                               should be followed over and above the requirements of BS 7671:

                                                For example, a simplified scope of works may be:
                                                   ‘The scope of works for this project is to install electrical systems within
                                                   a new two-storey extension to an existing four-bedroom house. The
                                                   works will include all wiring and containment systems for power, lighting
                                                   and distribution. The works will not include the intruder alarm or fire-
                                                   detection systems.’
                                                Although this scope of works immediately eliminates the intruder alarm and
                                                fire-detection systems, there will be interfaces between systems that need to be
                                                defined. These are generally included in the particular specification and drawings
                                                that follow this section.

                                                Specification of works
                                                This section describes the particular works to be carried out. It gives as much
                                                detail as possible of what the designer and client require for that particular
                                                package of works. It may consist of simple descriptions or technical requirements
                                                laid down for the contractor (tenderer) to price and eventually work to. This could
                                                include details of every circuit required or details of the equipment that needs a
                                                supply, therefore leaving the design to the company tendering.

                                                Materials and workmanship
                                                Also known as the standard specification, this section is usually the same for
                                                all projects. It comprises a list of requirements in terms of workmanship and
                                                the selection of material grades and quality, along with any applicable British
                                                Standards or industry codes of practice.

                                                Schedules
                                                This section includes drawing issue sheets that indicate which drawings have
                                                been issued as part of the tender/contract. It also contains other schedules,
                                                such as equipment schedules, containing manufacturer selections, performance
                                                requirements, sizes and weights, and distribution board schedules.

                                                This is usually the final document in the specification. The contractor (tenderer)
                                                has to complete it, specifying the cost of sections of work. Daywork rates also
                                                have to be specified in case unmeasured or urgent works need to be carried out
                                                that are not already contracted and cannot reasonably be priced or measured
                                                because of time pressures.

            Information from employer organisation
            During the planning and construction of an electrical installation, much
            information will be supplied to the site from your employer. This will include the
            client information and specification as detailed above, drawings as detailed below,
            and information relating to the administration of the organisation. Information
            from the employer organisation includes:

            Contract information
            Numerous sets of drawings are produced to communicate information about
            individual systems or collections of systems within a project. They include:
            ●    plans/layout drawings
            ●    schematic (block) diagrams
            ●    wiring diagrams
            ●    circuit diagrams.
            Other types of information, in the form of graphs and charts, which assist in the
            planning and construction of an electrical installation will be covered later in this
            chapter.
            Drawings usually use British Standard symbols. However, in order to represent the
            wide variety of materials and equipment available, non-standard symbols may
            also be used. A legend or key explains them.
            Plans or layout drawings are used to locate individual systems within the overall
            project and give an indication of the scale of the project. In addition, there may
            be drawings to show specific fixing, assembly and/or completion
                                                                                               LEGEND

            Wiring diagrams
            Wiring diagrams are generally provided to show in detail how a system or
            collection of systems is put together. They show locations, routing, the length
            of run and types of systems cabling. These types of diagrams are sometimes
            mistakenly referred to when it is actually a circuit diagram that is required.

                                           Circuit diagrams
                                           Circuit diagrams contain information on how circuits and systems operate. They
                                           can be provided as detailed layouts, although some information, such as length
                                           of run, may be omitted for clarity. In most instances, circuit diagrams are used for
                                           diagnostic purposes so that designers, installers and maintainers understand how
                                           their actions may influence a particular component or arrangement.
                                           At different stages of work, the information on the drawings and diagrams is given
                                           in different levels of detail. The information becomes more detailed and accurate
                                           as the project develops.

                                           There are five main levels of drawing:
                                           ●       sketch drawings/information
                                           ●       design/tender drawings
                                           ●       contract drawings
                                           ●       working/construction drawings
                                           ●       as fitted/installed drawings.

                                           Sketch drawings
                                           Sketch drawings are often hand-drawn sketches to help the designer demonstrate
                                           ideas and interpretations. They are usually drawn in the early stages of a project,
                                           when the scheme and designs are still fluid. They are therefore subject to change
                                           as every stakeholder is inputting to and potentially changing the scheme.

            On many smaller projects the general contractor usually refers to contract

                                           However, it is important that these drawings also reflect the overall design intent.

                                           Installed/fitted drawings
                                           Specialist shop drawings are a variant of construction drawings. They are
                                           normally produced so that manufacturers, suppliers and/or consultants can agree
                                           before manufacture takes place. In building services, installed/fitted drawings
                                           are normally produced by the subcontractor/installer. However, in structural
                                           engineering and certain architectural arrangements, they are provided by the
                                           structural engineer and architect respectively. This difference can cause problems
                                           and confusion.
                                           Installed/fitted drawings should represent what has been installed, but also
                                           contain information on any residual hazards and risk-reduction strategies
                                           employed and instructions on how to clean, maintain or deconstruct the works if
                                           necessary. The drawings become part of a wider set of operation and maintenance
                                           manuals.
                                           On completion of work which only involves electrical work, a specific Operation
                                           and Maintenance (O&M) manual should be provided for the electrical
                                           installation. This would include, depending on the extent of the work, key
                                           information such as:
                                           ●   certification and test results
                                           ●   circuit charts
                                           ●   as-installed drawings
                                           ●   what to do in the event of an emergency
                                           ●   list of spare parts (lamps, fuses, types and ratings, etc.)
                                           ●   instructions on use (timeclocks or other equipment)
                                           ●   regular maintenance instructions (RCD test buttons, cleaning, etc.).
                                           O&M manuals should also be updated or referred to when maintenance tasks are
                                           undertaken by electricians or additions made to the installation.
                                           If maintained correctly, O&M manuals can save the client money. As a simple
                                           example, imagine that lamps need changing in one or two high bay light fittings.
                                           Getting to the lamps requires hiring special access equipment and once the fitting
                                           is accessed, it is discovered that the lamp type needed is not in stock and it will be
                                           three days until it is available.
                                           If the O&M manual is referred to first, the lamp type can be looked up and
                                           ordered before the specialist access equipment is hired, meaning the access
                                           equipment is only needed once.
                                           Maintained O&M manuals can also greatly assist in fault finding or spotting faults
                                           before they happen by referencing historical test results and seeing patterns of
                                           damage or failure.

            Contracts
            There are legal implications that you need to bear in mind when submitting a              KEY TERM
            tender for work.                                                                          Tender: An offer to carry
                                                                                                      out work for a certain
            Contract law                                                                              amount of money, in
            English contract law regulates contracts in England and Wales. A contract                 accordance with a
                                                                                                      particular contract.
            generally forms when the contractor makes an offer and another person accepts
            it. Once a contract is made, it is enforceable in court.
            If problems are to be avoided, the offer must be made clearly, in sufficient detail,
            including its terms and conditions. Obviously, it is preferable if the offer is made
            and accepted in writing.

            Small works
            Small works such as house rewires, or minor works such as additions or
            alterations, will usually be carried out under the contractor’s own terms and
            conditions rather than the templates used for larger contracts.
            The cost of the work is usually presented to the client in one of two ways:
            ●    as a quotation. This is a fixed cost of the work. This is normally given where
                 there are no hidden problems or issues that can create hidden additional
                 costs. Where a quotation is given, the person providing the work must be
                 confident that they have clearly understood the client’s requirements and have
                 undertaken a site survey.
            ●    as an estimate. This is a method of providing a close as possible cost of works
                 but with the understanding that there could be some factors that affect the
                 cost. It is always a good idea to prepare the client for what the additional costs
                 could be and for what reason. Nobody likes, and may be unwilling to pay for, a
                 hugely inflated estimate.
            When working out the cost of labour for small works, the cost must include
            overheads.
                                                                                                      KEY TERM
            Overheads include items such as:                                                          Overheads are added
            ●    business insurances such as public liability and tool/equipment theft                to the labour costs as
            ●    office rent and costs of running the office, such as heating and lighting,           a percentage. Annual
                                                                                                      overheads should be
                 telephones/internet etc.                                                             calculated and divided
            ●    National Insurance contributions                                                     into the expected hours
            ●    holiday pay                                                                          worked annually to

            ●    transportation/vehicle costs such as MOT, servicing, insurance, tax                  over all works.

            The City & Guilds Textbook: Electrical Installations Book 2


                                               IMPROVE YOUR MATHS
                                               A small organisation employs two electricians who are each paid £16 per hour. It
                                               is anticipated that annual overhead costs are expected to be £17 600.00 and the
                                               labour force work an average of 35 hours a week with 5 weeks holiday a year.
                                               What would be their expected cost per hour to the client if 40% profit is added?
                                               Annual hours worked:
                                                  35 hours × 2 persons × (52 weeks − 5 weeks holiday) = 3290 chargable hours
                                               Overheads per hour:
                                                  £17 600
                                                            = £5.35 additional cost per hour
                                                    3290
                                               So, cost of labour with overheads:
                                                  £16 + £5.35 = £21.35
                                               Hourly rate with profit:
                                                  £21.35 + 40% = £29.89 per hour
                                               So the charge out rate per hour would be £29.89.


                                           Procurement methods
                                           There are several methods the client can use to establish the right contractor for
                                           a project, some of which are explained below. The following factors need to be
                                           considered when deciding on the most suitable procurement method:
                                           ●     budgets
                                           ●     time to the start of the contract
                                           ●     contract duration
                                           ●     quality
                                           ●     project limitations.
                                           The client may already know which contractor they would like to use for their
                                           project, based on recommendations from others or having previously appointed
                                           them on another project. However, decisions must be made with value for money
                                           in mind. Is the price given by the preferred contractor competitive? The only way
                                           to know is by having other tenders to compare it with.

                                           Open tendering
                                           Where the client invites an offer for the contract from any organisation, this is
                                           referred to as open tendering. The advantage of this is that the process is fair as
                                           it isn’t limited to preferred contractors. However, the client may have to choose a
                                           contractor whom they are not familiar with or who is less experienced. The client
                                           may have no alternative but to appoint a contractor based on their quotation and
                                           references from previous clients.

                                           Two-stage tender
                                           If the client would like to secure the services of a contractor early, without
                                           having all the relevant design information in place, they use a two-stage tender
                                           process. This would involve a contractor and client agreeing a cost based on
                                           the information provided so work can begin. At the second stage, when all

                                                                                                             Chapter 4 Working on site

            information is available, the contractor is able to negotiate a fixed price for
            completion of the work.

            Preferred supplier (selective)
            Clients with previous experience working on similar projects may have developed
            good working relationships with one or more contractors. Some of these
            contractors may be included on the client’s list of preferred suppliers. From this
            list, the client may select several contractors and invite them to tender.

            Negotiated tendering
            Where a client has invited just one contractor to price for a project, this is referred
            to as negotiated tendering. Before building contracts are signed, the client usually
            negotiates the best price for the work. This may not be the best method for a
            client that needs to prove value for money as they have no other costs with which
            to compare.

            Tender procedure for larger works
            When a company receives an invitation to tender for a particular contract, the
            normal process to follow would be:
            ●    record all documentation
            ●    gather information to form the estimate
            ●    determine prime costs
            ●    determine provisional sum
            ●    make final tender.

            Record all documentation
            All documents received in the invitation will be recorded and checked against the
            list of documents supplied, which should also be included. This ensures that all
            relevant documents are present and the most up-to-date versions of drawings

            ●    Being helpful even if a request is beyond your abilities. Saying ‘that isn’t my

                 ‘Have you spoken to this person about that?’.
            ●    Asking for feedback and acting on it. Everyone likes to receive good feedback,

            Service provision
            Services are required for a construction site to function, including:
            ●    electricity supplies
            ●    wholesome water and other water sources
            ●    waste-water systems
            ●    fuel sources.

            Electricity supplies
            Nearly all construction sites will require an electricity supply for power tools
            and lighting, as well as for administration and welfare blocks. Where the site is
            a refurbishment project, the existing electricity supply may be used but careful
            consideration must be given to the requirements in Section 704 of BS 7671
            (Construction and demolition site installations).
            As most major construction sites which use the existing electricity supply
            cannot guarantee the reliable connection of the main protective bonding
            conductor during refurbishment work, the site supply may be converted to a TT
            earthing arrangement during the site work. This means that the earthing for the
            construction site will rely on an earth electrode. An assessment must also be
            made as to whether the existing supply is suitably rated for the intended load
            during construction (see the considerations for load, below). If the construction
            site is new or remote, then a new supply must be requested, or a generator
            obtained. In both cases, an assessment of the demand needs to be made. This is              INDUSTRY TIP
            difficult as the total load will change regularly. A good way to gauge the overall
            load is to assess the overall kVA (kilo volt-amperes), taking into consideration:     Any application to the DNO

            supply is required, an application needs to be made to the local distribution
            network operator (DNO).                                                                     INDUSTRY TIP

                                           Larger construction sites will need to consider storage of fuels, such as diesel, for
                                           plant, vehicles and generators.

                                           Ventilation provision
                                           Ventilation needs to be considered in situations such as confined locations,
                                           tunnels, underground works or, more generally, in large buildings. Ventilation
                                           should also be considered for specific tasks which involve a large amount of dust,
                                           where the area is to be sealed off.
                                           Ventilation may also be required for particular items of equipment that are
                                           vulnerable to dust contamination. The most common method of ventilating areas
                                           is by a forced clean air system, where clean air is forced by fans through ducting
                                           into the area and, in many cases, extraction fans then remove stale air from the
                                           location.
                                           Other locations and equipment may adopt a system where air is forced into
                                           an area or enclosure, creating a high pressure. This high pressure minimises
                                           contamination by keeping out dust and contamination from lower pressure areas.

                                           Waste disposal procedures
                                           Careful consideration needs to be given to areas set aside for waste storage and
                                           collection. As waste is normally collected by large vehicles, easy access is one of
                                           the most important factors that affects the location of waste storage. Methods of
                                           separating waste for recycling, or hazardous waste, are covered in detail in Book 1,
                                           Chapter 1, pages 12–13.
                                           Construction sites for high-rise buildings require methods of moving waste from
                                           upper floor levels to waste collection points at ground level. This is normally done
                                           by rubbish chutes, which are flexible ducts that allow waste to fall safely, directly
                                           into a collection point.

            Storage facilities
            Good storage facilities must be provided for plant, machinery and materials in
            order to minimise:
            ●    theft
            ●    damage
            ●    congestion.
            A secure lockable area, such as a storage container, is a good method of reducing
            theft from sites as well as reducing the likelihood of damage from weather or
            general site activities. If a good secure area is not set aside for storage, materials
            left around a site can become a hazard by potentially blocking escape routes or
            becoming obstacles to others trying to carry out their tasks. As well as being
            a safety hazard, poor storage also becomes inefficient as it is more likely that
            materials will become damaged or lost, or time will be wasted moving the
            materials out of the way.
            When locating storage facilities, consideration should be given to:
            ●    ease of delivery of the storage container
            ●    ease of delivery of the equipment to be stored
            ●    minimising distances from storage to point of use
            ●    keeping emergency routes clear
            ●    keeping traffic areas clear, e.g. lorry turning circles
            ●    avoiding any location that is likely to be built on as part of the project or where
                 services are to be laid
            ●    not blocking services or systems, e.g. avoiding placing a container next to a
                 wall with a flue or vent
            ●    not blocking daylight from windows
            ●    presence of overhead cables
            ●    security.

            Health, safety and welfare requirements
            All construction sites, regardless of their size, must provide basic amenities,
            such as:
            ●    toilet facilities
            ●    washing facilities (hot and cold water)
            ●    first-aid facilities
            ●    changing rooms or lockers.
            On larger construction sites, rest areas which provide shelter from the weather
            should also be provided. Showers must be provided on sites where tasks involve                   INDUSTRY TIP

                                           Planning for materials and equipment
                                           The most significant cost of any installation work is that of the labour required;
                                           however, a close second is that of the materials to be used. When confronted
                                           with a new project, it is essential to understand what materials will be required to
                                           complete the work. To help understand this, the installation team needs a number
                                           of documents.

                                           The technical specification
                                           The technical specification is the most important document as it has been

              expectations.
                                           The technical specification will also detail what other standards are to be
                                           complied with, as well as extra options required. For example, the client may
                                           require a minimum of 25% extra capacity on every distribution board. This
                                           would have an impact on the equipment ordered. For example, if a distribution
                                           board was specified as providing a supply to ten circuits, then typically a 16-way
                                           distribution board would be required to meet the client’s request.
                                           Other key information that is normally contained within the technical
                                           specification is the detail of the building construction. The technical specification
                                           will detail the construction of the wall, along with the details of the floor, wall

                                           Materials list
                                           Trying to keep track of all the materials required, just by marking up drawings, can
                                           become very complicated, especially on larger projects. Therefore, it is common
                                           practice to use a series of documents generically called the materials list.
                                           Materials lists will contain different information, depending on company
                                           procedures and requirements; however, there are always some common aspects
                                           and these include:
                                           ●   the index number – a simple numerical identifier that makes it easier to track
                                               items on the materials list

                                           Site meetings
                                           From concept right through to completion, the key success factor to most projects
                                           is keeping the relevant trades and contractors informed and giving them a
                                           platform for their input. Site meetings are one way in which this can be achieved.
                                           The name ‘site meeting’ is sometimes misleading as these meetings do not always
                                           happen at the construction site. In fact, on many large contracts, the site meeting
                                           often starts in company boardrooms, where essential decisions have to be made
                                           to get the project started.

                                            IMPROVE YOUR ENGLISH
                                            Site meetings are key to keeping all involved up to date and ‘on the same page’.
                                            Meetings provide an opportunity to communicate ideas or raise concerns.
                                            Having the confidence and skills to clearly articulate yourself is important to
                                            ensuring your input is heard and valued.

                                           Once the construction site has been established, the site meetings take on a
                                           slightly different role as they are more about coordinating the activities being
                                           performed on the site. At this point the meetings are normally chaired by the
                                           main contractor. It is the main contractor who is ultimately responsible for what
                                           happens on a construction site and so they often use the meeting to ensure
                                           that all parties are working together and that the project is progressing to plan.
                                           It is through these meetings that the project progress can be established and
                                           monitored. Each meeting is minuted and a formal progress report is issued to the
                                           client and the architect. These reports are also used to confirm when the build has
                                           reached a critical point and that the next phase of work can be commenced.
                                           One of the many other benefits of having regular communication between all
                                           the trades on a construction site is the ability to ensure that there is coordination
                                           among all affected trades on key items. The standard build of an electrical
                                           installation needs to happen at key points in the progress of the project. First fix
                                           must happen after the walls are erected but before they are plastered. This means
                                           that the installation team needs cooperation from both builders and plasterers.
                                           The site meeting can provide a means for achieving this.

                                              This means that the existing installation must undergo assessment before any
                                              work is carried out, and it is a good idea to ensure that this is done before the
                                              extent of the work has been agreed and a price set.

                                              The pre-work survey
                                              The pre-work survey is intended to establish if the current installation can support
                                              the proposed changes and to check the condition of the existing installation,
                                              including identifying any damage already present. It is therefore important
                                              to record the results of the inspection, noting whether everything is in good
                                              condition.
                                              To perform a pre-work survey, an installer will need a test instrument to perform
                                              tests, such as:
                                              ●   earth fault loop impedance
                                              ●   prospective fault current
                                              ●   polarity of supply.

                         INDUSTRY TIP         They will also need a torch, a set of insulated screwdrivers, a camera and
                                              something to record their findings on. One document that can be used for this
              See Chapter 7 of this book,     is the Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) complete with a Condition
              Figure 7.5, for an example      Report Inspection Schedule (CRIS). It is important to understand, though, that this
              of an Electrical Installation   is not the same as performing a periodic inspection of the system but is simply to
              Condition Report (EICR).        confirm the current condition of the installation, prior to changes.
                                              The purpose of the camera is to make sure that there is documented proof of
                                              the condition prior to work commencing, should any problems or damage be
                                              identified. Simply taking a picture of the damage or problem can often help to
                                              clarify with the client what work will be undertaken. It is important to focus on
                                              the area where the work is going to be performed, including access routes.
                                              If a pre-work survey is not conducted and the client notices some damage to their
                                              property after the work is finished, they may blame the installer for the damage
                                              and expect it to be corrected, with the installer footing the bill, which can be
                                              expensive. If, however, a pre-work survey has been performed, this may prove that
                                              the installer is not responsible for the damage.
                                              As well as checking the condition of the electrical installation, it is important to
                                              check the surrounding areas and access routes for existing damage, rather like
                                              checking a hire car before driving it away.
                                              Checking for existing damage is important as it:
                                              ●   may identify challenges for the installer that had not been noticed before
                                              ●   can reveal potential problems within the installation
                                              ●   can identify where further work may be required.
                                              Table 4.2 shows some of the things that should be checked for outside of the
                                              installation.

            What to do if damage is discovered
            If damage is discovered during the pre-work survey, then the installer simply needs      VALUES AND
            to make a note of the damage and take a quick photograph. Then, before starting
            work, the installer should speak to the client and point out the damage identified.      BEHAVIOURS
            It is always important to make the client aware that the damage is only being            When informing
            identified to confirm they are already aware of its existence. If damage is              customers of damage
            discovered during work, then it is important again for the installer to record it and,   identified pre-
            where possible, take a photograph of the damage. If the damage is severe, then           installation, a lot of
                                                                                                     tact is often required,
            the client also needs to be made aware of the damage as soon as possible. This
                                                                                                     as the installer will
            may mean that work has to stop, depending on the severity of the damage. This
                                                                                                     potentially be pointing
            typically includes damage to structural elements, such as floor joists that were

            Another type of damage that might be identified at this time, rather than earlier,
            is damage to wiring caused by overheating conductors or rodents chewing cables.
            In this instance it is important to show this to the client as soon as is practicable,
            as it may require further action that is beyond the scope of the planned work.

              HEALTH AND SAFETY
              Damaged wiring presents an immediate risk of electric shock. It must be made
              safe immediately and this may involve safely isolating the circuit and getting
              guidance from the client as to the remedial action they require. This often will
              require the client to speak with the company employing the installer, to agree a
              contract detailing additional work to be performed and its cost.


            Protecting the property
            After checking for existing damage prior to starting work, it is just as important
            to make sure that damage does not occur as the work is being carried out.

                                               Detailed planning could save a lot of time and delays. In addition, it is often

                                               estimating the cost of the work as it is too easy to focus on the new, rather than
                                               the time and effort needed to remove the old systems. This time and effort can
                                               be considerable and therefore costly.

                                               Managing a safe site
                                               In Book 1, Chapter 1, we covered in detail the methods used to keep sites safe.

                                               of these locations are zoned depending on the level of danger or proximity to
                                               hazardous materials. Careful consideration is needed regarding the types of plant

                                               flame-proof enclosures.
                                               Special training is always a requirement before working on these types of site.
                                               Managing a standard site safely requires different types of information as well as
                                               trained personnel.

            Information needed to promote health and safety
            The principal contractor has responsibilities to secure health and safety on site.
            This involves gathering information from the contract documents, including the
            design specifications, and all stakeholders, including:
            ●    the client
            ●    the design team
            ●    other contractors on site
            ●    specialist contractors and consultants
            ●    trade and contractor organisations
            ●    equipment and material suppliers.
            Additional information will also be required on special features, such as:
            ●    asbestos or other contaminants
            ●    overhead power lines and underground services
            ●    unusual ground conditions
            ●    public rights of way across the site
            ●    nearby schools, footpaths, roads or railways
            ●    other activities going on at the site.

            Managing safety on site before work starts
            The principal contractor must assess access to the work site, arrange a programme
            of work and ensure that access arrangements are suitable for subcontractors to
            use. Any specialist contractors who need to work in isolation for safety reasons
            (e.g. with chemicals or radio isotopes) should be consulted and appropriate time
            allowed in the programme of work for them to carry out their duties safely. In
            conjunction with the subcontractors, the principal contractor must ensure that:
            ●    all relevant working methods have been identified and time allowed for them
                 to be undertaken
            ●    all equipment used on site is compatible with other operations on site at the
                 time allocated on the programme
            ●    all potential hazards have been considered and as many as possible eliminated
                 (e.g. painting does not need to be done at height if materials are brought to
                 site already finished)
            ●    all remaining risks are assessed, decisions are taken on how to control them
                 and procedures are put in place
            ●    everyone working on site is competent and has the right equipment to do their
                 work
            ●    appropriate work methods are agreed
            ●    site deliveries are arranged at the best times to minimise safety risks to the
                 public, taking into account neighbourhood circumstances, such as school drop-
                 off and pick-up times
            ●    emergency and rescue procedures for the site are in place, including any
                 additional training required (e.g. harness rescue from height).

                                           Ensuring workers’ competence and awareness of risks
                                           Those who supervise the work must be adequately trained, have suitable
                                           experience and have access to additional guidance to ensure they are competent.
                                           They must ensure that agreed work methods are put into practice.
                                           Workers must be competent to carry out their work, so their trade certificates
                                           and Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) card or trade skill card should
                                           be checked. They must have suitable equipment to carry out their work. The
                                           Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS) card is one example of a trade card
                                           (see page 460).
                                           It is also important to ensure that subcontractors on site have adequate
                                           supervision and that their operatives are trained and competent in the tasks they
                                           are employed to carry out.
                                           Before any worker starts work on site, it is important to make sure they:
                                           ●   understand the general risks on the site
                                           ●   are familiar with the tasks they are being employed to carry out
                                           ●   are aware of any additional hazards or increased risk due to local conditions.
                                           This information will usually be set out in the workers’ method statement, worked
                                           through at the site induction and checked on a regular basis, with formal follow-

                                           It is necessary to ensure that all measures put in place are relevant and effective.
                                           It is therefore important to review procedures on a regular basis to make sure they
                                           continue to be relevant and effective as time goes by and the nature of work on
                                           site changes.
                                           Monitoring of health and safety on site must be carried out by a trained and
                                           competent person, who is able to review the safety procedures in the context of
                                           all the changes in work and circumstances on site. The review process must also
                                           check that contractors and subcontractors are working safely and in line with their
                                           method statements. Action must be taken to deal with those who fail to work
                                           safely. The review should also consider whether similar problems reoccur, find
                                           out why and prompt appropriate action before there is an accident. This process
                                           should include monitoring minor accidents and near misses in the accident book,
                                           as this could give early warning of the potential for a more serious incident.

            HSE inspections
            HSE (Health and Safety Executive) inspectors routinely inspect places of work.
            Although it is unusual to call unannounced, they have the right to enter and
            inspect any workplace without giving notice.
            If they are on a routine visit, rather than responding to a complaint or particular
            incident, inspectors inspect the workplace, work activities, and methods and
            procedures used for the management of health and safety, and check compliance
            with health and safety law relevant to the specific workplace. The inspector
            is empowered to talk to employees and their representatives, and to take
            photographs and samples.
            Where breaches in requirements are observed, the inspector can serve the
            following, depending on the severity of the breach.
            ●    Informal warning – Where the breach is minor, the inspector can explain on
                 site what is required to the duty holder (usually the employer), following up
                 with written advice explaining best practice and the legal requirements.
            ●    Improvement notice – Where the breach is more serious, the notice will state
                 what has to be done, why and when the remedial action has to be completed
                 by. The inspector can take further legal action if the notice is not complied
                 with within the time period specified. The duty holder has the right to appeal
                 to an industrial tribunal.
            ●    Prohibition notice – Where there is a risk of serious personal injury, the
                 inspector can stop the activity immediately or after a specific period. The
                 activity cannot be resumed until remedial action has taken place. The duty
                 holder has the right of appeal to an industrial tribunal.
            ●    Prosecution – In certain circumstances, the inspector may consider
                 prosecution necessary to punish offenders and deter other potential offenders
                 where circumstances result in serious danger to persons or property.

                                           Regulation 9 (2) of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 by not providing
                                           sufficient guard rails or netting. Those breaching these measures are generally
                                           taken to court by an enforcing authority. In cases of health and safety legislation
                                           violation, this is done by the HSE. When cases go to court, specialist lawyers are
                                           called on to work through the complexities of the relevant area of law. Often
                                           the evidence of expert witnesses is sought to obtain professional opinions on the
                                           subject. The outcome will be an acquittal or a sentence with remedial/corrective
                                           action.
                                           In general, employers are responsible for the actions of their employees and,
                                           where these result in breaches in legislation or accidents, it is the employer that is
                                           punished. However, where a breach is entirely due to an employee, the employer
                                           has the right to impose its own disciplinary processes, which, at worst, may result
                                           in a finding of gross misconduct and dismissal.


              KEY TERM                     Managing an efficient site
              Efficient is a process       In order for a site to work efficiently, key planning is required to ensure all
              working with maximum         necessary plant, equipment and labour is on site as it is required. If too many
              productivity and             people are on site, it is costly and if materials or plant are delivered too soon,
              minimum wasted effort.       there is a likelihood that they will become damaged and require replacing. In
                                           addition, materials will need to be paid for long in advance of when they are
                                           needed and before any interim payments are made to cover the material costs.

                                           Building information modelling (BIM)
                                           Building information modelling (BIM) is the production of a digital three-
                                           dimensional (3D) model of a building project. As well as providing detailed plans,
                                           layouts and views of a building in 3D, it also shows how different parts of the
                                           building interact, including installation sequencing. This in turn can be used to
                                           produce work programmes.
                                           BIM can also provide the following benefits to building design and construction:
                                           ●   a visual image of what the inside and outside of a building will look like for the
                                               client to agree. This could be in the form of a virtual tour.
                                           ●   seeing the positions of controls or accessories or how services such as lighting
                                               can integrate.
                                           ●   the possibility for several designers/stakeholders to collaborate together on a
                                               project in real time as the project changes and develops.
                                           ●   it ensures smooth running of a contract by providing detailed specifications
                                               and schedules during the construction phase known as the Digital Plan of Work
                                               (DPoW). This is used to organise resources such as materials, plant and labour.

            Work programmes
            A work programme is initially drawn up by the client or the client’s quantity
            surveyor to help determine the construction period and whether the scheme is
            feasible and affordable in the client’s timeframe.

                                           Once a critical path analysis has been carried out, the project manager may
                                           decide there is too much risk in a particular critical point and ask the planner
                                           to re-plan activities to remove it from the critical path. This involves building
                                           contingency time around that point. This will result in a slightly longer
                                           programme, but adds an element of realism so that if delays occur around the
                                           identified point, they do not affect the critical path.
                                           The basic critical path technique is to:
                                           ●   list all the activities necessary to complete the project
                                           ●   add the time that each activity will take
                                           ●   determine the dependency between the activities, e.g. activity C cannot start
                                               until activity B is completed.
                                           The analysis will identify those activities or tasks that are essential – that
                                           generally take the longest time to complete and that form the critical path around
                                           which the other activities are to be organised.

                                           Critical path example
                                           In its simplest form, the critical path illustrated in Figure 4.9a shows how the
                                           sequence of tasks or activities affect each other.

                                           ●   Looking at Figure 4.9, it can be seen that the critical path is the longest route,
                                               which is A-D-E, as that takes nine days. Tasks B-C take eight days and A-F take
                                               seven days.
                                           ●   If task F, during the planning stage, was extended to six days, perhaps due to a
                                               specific curing or drying period, the whole job would be extended by one day
                                               and the path A-F would become the critical path.
                                           ●   This diagram shows the task details in the connecting lines. Other critical path
                                               networks may show the task detail in the circles.

            contract. Although programmes of work do allow for some potential delays, for
            example due to weather, one of the main benefits of using programmes of work is
            that the programme can be adjusted in order to minimise delays.

            Example method for creating a simple critical path network and bar
            chart step by step
            Below, is an example of how to create a critical path network and bar chart using
            a simple process of making and baking bread.
            1 Using a table, set out the tasks that are required and decide if any tasks
                are reliant on another being finished. For example, it is difficult to mix the
                ingredients before they are weighed; if you did, the overall process is badly in
                danger of failing. Also at this stage, consider the time it takes for each task.

                                                   be carried out in that waiting time.
                                              Once the path has been created, this could then be transferred onto a bar chart,
                                              so the process is easy to follow and time can be maximised by filling in the gaps
                                              of time by the non-dependent tasks.

                                                   not too early so that energy used to keep the oven hot was minimised.
                                              ●    D (prepare baking tins) wasn’t dependent on anything but F (knock back
                                                   dough and place in tins) was dependent on D, so D was carried out in the time

                                              Once the work has been scheduled using methods such as critical path networks,
              Changing conditions at          we need to consider what affects changes in the work schedule.
              the workplace can lead to       One of the most appropriate methods of overcoming changing conditions in the
              delays and alterations in the   workplace is to hold a site meeting so the impact of the delays may be discussed
              work programme, but good        by all parties concerned. If the rescheduling of work leads to changes to the
              communication between the

            material or changing labour requirements. The VO effectively makes allowance
            for this change in contract. In many cases, the changing work, materials or labour
            costs would be documented by the subcontractor by issuing the contractor or
            client with daywork sheets.
            Daywork sheets document the additional labour, materials and machinery costs
            involved from a VO. Daywork sheets are generally used when the VO costs are
            difficult to estimate.
            During work operations, various documents will be used within an organisation.
            These include:
            ●    purchase orders
            ●    delivery notes
            ●    time sheets.

            Purchase orders
            Purchase orders provide a method of documenting what materials or plant are
            purchased. By giving each order a unique number, specific materials can be
            accounted for to a particular project. Although many wholesalers or suppliers do
            not require the issue of purchase orders, it is always good practice to use them to
            allow the delivered items to be checked for accuracy.

            Delivery notes
            Delivery notes are the documents that are attached to or delivered with any
            delivery. It is essential that delivery notes are checked against the delivered
            materials, wherever possible at the time of delivery. This identifies if the wrong
            materials have been delivered and if items are missing. The delivery note normally
            requires a signature to confirm the number of items delivered.
            If a problem with the delivery is discovered later, responsibility for the problem
            can be difficult and costly to prove. Missing components will also affect
            performance on site. The delay in supply of even simple products, such as bolt
            fixings to secure the structure, can affect the timing on a project badly.
            Delivery notes should be checked off and processed through the supervisor. They
            may then be sent to the administrators for processing or direct to the contractor’s
            quantity surveyor for costing against the project.

            Time sheets
            Time sheets are a simple but very effective tool in assigning work costs to
            particular jobs or budgets. They indicate where labour costs have been expended,
            including where additional works have been carried out and need charging to the
            client, which is of vital importance to profit levels.
            Time sheets that break work down into specific tasks can also be used by
            managers and estimators to indicate areas where the estimate was totally
            inaccurate. This information can then be used when pricing future works.
            Once submitted, a time sheet is a legal document stating the hours worked on a
            task or project.

                                               When work is performed in a building, whether alterations, removal of equipment,
                                               or new installations, there will always be an element of restoration required. The
                                               most commonly damaged parts, either when adding or removing items, are the
                                               walls of the building. The three main areas likely to need attention are:
                                               ●   plaster
                                               ●   wallpaper

                                               A variety of repair techniques can be applied but, in this chapter, just one
                                               technique for each form of damage is explained.

                                               Once the hole or crack has been filled, the filler must be left to set. Setting and
                                               drying time will vary, depending on the make of the filler. The manufacturer’s
                                               instructions will give guidance. Once set, the filler can be sanded level, but a
                                               subsequent layer of filler may be needed to ensure a perfectly smooth finish that

            work starts.
            To repair a hole or chase, first remove all loose or crumbling
            plaster. This can be done using a stiff brush and a scraper. Once
            all loose material has been removed, the hole must have all the
            dust removed. This can be achieved using either a soft brush or a
            vacuum cleaner.
            With the hole cleaned and free from all debris, spray the area with a
            fine spray of water and allow to dry. Next, a bonding agent must be
            applied to the wall. The purpose of the bonding agent is to help the
            plaster stick into place. Most bonding agents are in liquid form that
            is either painted on or, more commonly, sprayed on. The bonding
            agent must be left to dry. This typically takes about 45 minutes.
            On more porous walls, a second coat may be required but this is

            When the bonding agent is dry, the hole can now be partially filled with
            plaster applied with a 100 mm wide broadknife. When filling the hole,
            work out from the centre of the hole towards the edges. The hole must not
            be totally filled, as a layer of finish plaster will also be required. Leave about
            1–2 mm of the depth of the hole unfilled and then, before the plaster sets,
            scratch the surface with the edge of the broadknife to create a criss-cross
            pattern.

                                               Before you can remove the damaged tile, you will need to weaken it by drilling
                                               5 mm diameter holes in the surface. Most tiles have a smooth, glazed finish, so
                                               it can be helpful to use masking tape to create a large diagonal cross on the tile.

            the grout from around the tile. Take care to ensure that the surrounding tiles are
            not damaged when using the grouting rake. Sometimes
            tile spacers will have been used to ensure equal spacing
            between tiles. These plastic spacers can often cause a grout
            rake to slip, so take particular care at each corner.
            With all the grout removed from around the damaged tile,
            the next stage is to start removing the tile. Using a sharp
            cold chisel and hammer, chip away at the tile, starting from
            the middle, and work out towards the edges along the
            masking tape. Care must be taken to avoid damaging the
            wall by hitting too hard, or through the chisel slipping.
            Once the tile has been broken along the masking tape,
            remove the tape and clear away any of the tile that has         Figure 4.18 Tile spacers

            With the tile now removed, it is important to prepare the wall for the replacement             protection, dust mask and
            tile. Start by using the wood chisel to continue to remove the old adhesive. It                gloves while breaking and
            is a good idea to use the new tile as a depth gauge to establish how much old                  removing the tile.
            adhesive needs to be removed, and from where. In order for the new tile to be
            easily and safely removed from the hole, it is a good idea to attach a piece of
            masking tape, as a tab, to the front of the tile to provide something to grip.
            Once the wall has been cleaned to the correct depth, use an adhesive comb to
            apply tile adhesive to the back of the new tile. Having already used the tile to see
            if the wall was level will have given an indication of how much tile adhesive is
            needed. Use the tab to grip the tile and position the new tile in the prepared hole,
            making sure it is flush with the surrounding tiles.
            The tile can be evenly spaced by using tile spacers, but this time with
            them positioned just in between the gaps at the bottom and sides
            rather than at the corners of each tile. With spacers in place, the tile
            adhesive must be left to harden. The time to set will vary, depending
            on the type of adhesive used, but typically, ready-mixed adhesive
            requires about twenty-four hours to set. Fast-setting adhesives are
            available, but always read the instructions.
            Once the adhesive has set, the spacers can be removed and the space
            around the tile can be filled with grout to reseal the tiles. The grout
            can be applied with a grout-finishing tool and then any excess can be
            polished off with a dry cloth, once the grout has dried.                       Figure 4.19 Fast-setting tile adhesive

                                             Tidying up
                                             Once any repair work has been performed, it is important to clean up properly.
                                             This includes removing all rubbish and waste materials. Dust sheets and covers
                                             that have been used must be carefully folded in on themselves so as not to
                                             generate any more dust and to capture any residue inside the sheets.
                                             With the dustsheets and protective covers removed from the work area, it is time
                                             to use the most important tools in terms of customer relations, the dustpan and
                                             brush and vacuum cleaner. Ensuring the work area is clean and tidy after you have
                                             finished will often go a long way towards bringing repeat business from many
                                             clients. It also provides a chance to confirm that all tools have been collected and
                                             packed away, rather than being lost or misplaced.

CHAPTER 5
            ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION DESIGN




               INTRODUCTION
               Every installation requires some degree of design. When an electrician simply selects a 2.5 mm2 cable because
               that is what they always use, or when somebody spends dedicated time calculating each circuit, it is still design.
               The individual who decides what is to be installed is effectively the designer for that installation and thus carries all
               associated responsibilities. Regulation 132 of BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition states:
                  ‘The electrical installation shall be designed by one or more skilled persons to provide for:
                  ● the protection of persons, livestock and property in accordance with Section 131

                  ● the proper functioning of the electrical installation for the intended use.

                  The information required as a basis for design is stated in Regulations 132.2 to 5. The requirements with
                  which the design shall comply are stated in Regulations 132.6 to 16.’
               BS 7671 makes it clear that before design begins, the designer must have information relating to:
               ● characteristics of supply
               ● nature of demand
               ● safety services
               ● environmental conditions.

               Then, the design is based upon, where applicable, the fundamental principles in Regulations 132.6 to 132.16,
               which contain details relating to the design of:
               ● cross-sectional area (csa) of conductors
               ● type of wiring and method of installation
               ● protective equipment
               ● emergency control
               ● disconnecting devices
               ● prevention of mutual detrimental influences (deterioration of electrical or other services should they affect
                  one another; an example is hot-water pipes damaging cables)
               ● accessibility of electrical equipment
               ● documentation for the electrical installation
               ● protective devices and switches
               ● isolation and switching
               ● additions or alteration to an installation (effects on existing systems).

               This chapter looks at the process of design and how it is applied to common types of electrical installations. It
               pulls together all the knowledge covered in Book 1 and this book so far. Note that inspection and testing will be
               covered separately in Chapter 6 of this book, and fault diagnosis in Chapter 7.
               The designer of an installation requires knowledge of:
               ● health and safety: the future installation must allow for safe and suitable operation and maintenance
                  (Book 1, Chapter 1)
               ● scientific principles: how electricity affects cables, equipment, etc. (Book 1, Chapter 2; Book 2, Chapter 2)
               ● installation practices and technology: the characteristics of wiring and wiring systems (Book 1, Chapters 3 and 4)
               ● environmental technologies: how they integrate with electrical systems (Book 2, Chapter 1)

                                                 SUPPLY CHARACTERISTICS
                                                 Part of the design process is having knowledge of the supply details or, if there is
                                                 no supply available, knowing how to obtain one.

                                                 Existing supplies
                                                 Before any design is carried out within an electrical installation, details relating
                                                 to the supply must be looked at and assessed as they can change the way the
                                                 design is undertaken and what type of protection is used. If frequency and
                                                 voltage are nominal, the supply details can be looked at in four ways:
                                                 ●    live conductors – how many?
                                                 ●    current – what is the maximum rating?
                                                 ●    prospective fault current – how large is it?
                                                 ●    earthing arrangement – what earthing system is used and what is the value of
                                                      external impedance?

                                                     KEY TERM
                                                     Nominal: Nominal voltage to earth (U0) in the UK is 230 V, so if you measure
                                                     the voltage between line and earth, you should read 230 V. In reality, the
                                                     voltage is likely to be higher than this or in some cases, lower. It all depends
                                                     on where the installation is in relation to the substation transformer. The
                                                     further away, the more voltage is lost, so the lower the real voltage. Voltage
                                                     can also vary with demand. The more demand that is placed on a substation
                                                     transformer, the lower the voltage will be.
                                                     As voltage can vary, a standard measurement is required that we can use in
                                                     calculations. We use these nominal (normal) values:
                                                     ● Nominal voltage to earth (U0) = 230 V
                                                     ● Nominal voltage (U) line to line or line to neutral = 400/230 V.

                                                     For information relating to the maximum and minimum actual supply voltages, see

            Current
            Another factor that affects the supply is the current rating, which is known as
            maximum demand. Most average-sized houses in the UK will have a maximum
            demand less than 100 A and many houses in a road or estate will be supplied
            from a single substation transformer. Most commonly, house supplies are rated
            at 80 A.
            Larger installations that have a maximum demand over 100 A are likely to be
            supplied using three phases in order to spread the load in the supply. Where a
            building needs a supply over 400 A per phase, it may have its own substation
            transformer installed on site.
            The maximum demand for an electrical installation will be governed by the size of
            the incoming supply cables and the rating of the distribution network operator’s
            (DNO’s) service fuse, so where an installation is to be added to, you must always
            check that the supply has enough capacity for the extra load.
            Where a new building is to be given a supply, the DNO needs to know the
            proposed maximum demand for the electrical installation, so it can provide an
            adequate supply. It would be the role of the designer to provide this.
            Typical current ratings of DNO service fuses are 63 A, 80 A, 100 A, 125 A, 150 A,
            200 A, 300 A, 400 A and 500 A.
            The DNO’s service fuse is fitted inside the electrical service head (cut-out).        KEY TERM

            Most DNO fuses will be in a fuse carrier that is ‘sealed’ to the service head,        tails to the meter.
            meaning the fuse can only be removed or replaced by a person approved by
            the DNO. The seal is a small wire which, with a special sealing crimp tool, locks
            the fuse to the service cut-out, so the seal must be broken if the fuse is to be
            removed. Connections to meters will also be sealed in this way. You must always
            contact the DNO if you need to remove a fuse from a service head.

            Earthing arrangement
            The earthing arrangement is the system describing how the electrical installation
            and supply is earthed. In the UK, there are three common earthing arrangements.
            These are described using abbreviations and were covered in detail in Chapter 3,
            pages 174–8. The type of earthing arrangement given by the DNO depends a lot
            on where the installation is located and how old the installation supply is.
            The most common earthing arrangement now used in the UK is TN-C-S,
            otherwise known as protective multiple earthing (PME).
            If you contact the DNO and ask for details of the supply, they will normally
            declare values of external loop impedance (Ze) as:
            ●    TN-C-S: 0.35 Ω
            ●    TN-S: 0.8 Ω.

                                                New supplies
                                                When a new building or facility is developed, there is no existing supply and so a
                                                new supply must be obtained from the DNO.
                                                In order for a new supply to be arranged and installed, the DNO needs to know
                                                certain additional details or information before the supply can be installed.
                                                These include:

              service.                          Responsibility
                                                Once the supply has been metered, it generally stops being the responsibility of
                                                the DNO and now becomes the responsibility of the consumer, the person who
                                                owns the electrical system inside the building, or, in simple terms, the person who
                                                pays the electricity bill.
                                                In some situations, more likely in newer buildings, there may be a switch between
                                                the meter and the consumer unit (CU). This switch may have been fitted by
                                                the DNO or by the contractor who carried out the installation work. If you are
                                                designing a new installation, it is always a good idea to fit a switch just after the
                                                meter so that work can be carried out to all parts of an installation, including
                                                inside the CU, with total isolation and without the need for the DNO to come and
                                                remove the cut-out fuse.

            Tails must be insulated and sheathed as they must have mechanical protection.
            Having two layers of insulating material gives them much better protection and
            reduces the risk of electric shock from them.
            Tails must be as short as possible. The two layers of insulation must cover the
            entire cable, especially when inside a metal consumer control unit, right up to the
            point where they connect to the main switch inside the unit.
            If the CU is located away from the meter point, then double-insulated tails
            should not be used and a much better cable, such as a steel-wire armour cable,
            should be used. The cross-sectional area (csa) of the tails is normally stipulated
            by the DNO or sized in accordance with the intended maximum demand.
            Regulation 522.8.5 stipulates that meter tails must be supported in such a way
            that no undue strain should be placed upon the termination with equipment due                   INDUSTRY TIP

            CIRCUITS
            There are generally three circuit arrangements. These are:
            ●    radial power circuits
            ●    ring-final circuits                                                                        INDUSTRY TIP

                                                                                                     Guide and Appendix 15 of

            Radial circuits are simply circuits that supply a single item of equipment or            give more guidance on the
            multiple items, such as socket outlets, using one cable containing a line or lines       configuration of radial power

            Radial power circuits generally supply socket outlets but may also supply
            individual appliances or loads. Power circuits may be wired in two different ways:
            ring-final and radial.
            The major advantages for using radial power circuits is that the cable csa is
            designed and selected to match the load and protective device so, if designed
            correctly, the cable will be protected. In addition, should a fault occur in a
            circuit, such as a loose connection (open circuit), then the equipment will not
            function, meaning someone is likely to report the fault and have it corrected
            immediately.

                                              Radial circuits may be branched where additional items are added or to ease the
                                              wiring to a socket outlet or equipment that is not on route with others and it may
                                              be easier to take a single cable instead of two; one there and one back. Branches are
                                              acceptable but should be minimised as too many could make fault detection harder.


                                              Ring-final circuits
                                              Ring-final circuits are the conventional means of wiring socket-outlet circuits
                                              within the UK. The reason for their use was to provide a high number of
                                              conveniently placed outlets adjacent to the loads. The circuit load is shared by
                                              two conductors in parallel. This also assists in improving voltage drop as the
                                              conductors being in parallel reduces the overall resistance.

                                              p Figure 5.3 Ring-final circuit showing spurs

                                              Ring-final circuits are able to supply an unlimited number of outlets serving a
                                              maximum floor area of 100 m2. Permanent loads, such as immersion heaters,
                                              should not be connected to a ring-final circuit. Ring-final circuits supplying kitchens
                                              should be arranged to have the loads equally distributed around the circuit. The
                                              plugs and fused connection units are normally fitted with 3 A or 13 A fuses.
                                              Spurs are like branches in a radial circuit and are common where socket outlets are
                                              added to existing ring circuits. There are limitations to the amount of spurs, and
                                              the amount of outlets per spur, as the cable used for the spur is undersized for the
                                              protective device as there is no second set of conductors in parallel to the spur.
                                              With technology reducing the consumption of appliances and equipment, the
                                              need for a ring-final circuit is being questioned as this arrangement does have
                                              several disadvantages.
                                              ●   If a ring-final circuit becomes an open circuit, this may not necessarily be
                                                  detected by the user because power will still be distributed to all socket
                                                  outlets. Circuit conductors may then become overloaded, leading to the
                                                  possibility of fire.
                                              ●   Earth fault loop impedances and circuit resistance values between live
                                                  conductors may also increase due to this, leading to increased disconnection
                                                  times.
                                              ●   Testing the continuity of ring-final circuits is more time consuming than
                                                  testing the continuity of radial circuits.

            Designers today are very likely to specify radial socket-outlet circuits with a
            reduced nominal rating of protective device due to these reasons. This also
            reduces the inconvenience of many socket outlets being lost due to a
            single-circuit failure.

            Three-plate
            Because composite cables limit the freedom to take a single conductor between
            one point and another, lighting circuits wired in composite cables require more
            joints within the circuit. These additional joints in the cable are called loop-ins and
            are usually in the form of a third live terminal within a light point, such as a ceiling
            rose. As the rose contains a third terminal, the system gets the name three-plate.
            Although it is traditional to install the three-plate at the light point, this is
            not necessarily the case in all situations. Many installers will install the three-
            plate at a switch. This is now very common
            practice, especially when the wiring in
            the ceiling is difficult to access, such as in
            multi-storey flats or flat roofs. The added
            advantage to this is that it reduces the

                                              Conduit method
                                              Because single-core cables can be drawn into conduit or trunking, there is no need
                                              to break the cable at the light point as the cable can be drawn straight to the
                                              switch. This has the advantage of reducing the amount of connections in a circuit
                                              and thus reducing the possibility of faults occurring. Circuits wired this way can
                                              also be easily reconfigured for additional lighting points or switches, such as two-
                                              way arrangements.

                                              Energy efficiency
                                              In commercial installations, lighting can account for much wasted energy. Lighting
                                              circuits, if arranged correctly, could be switched off during times of zero usage
                                              and full daylight. This could be achieved by zoning a lighting circuit and arranging
                                              automated switching devices to activate lighting by:
                                              ●   daylight sensors or light-sensitive switches: to control luminaires located near
                                                  windows by switching them off when the daylight provides suitable levels of
                                                  light
                                              ●   movement sensors: to keep luminaires switched off until the area in which
                                                  they are located is accessed
                                              ●   time-delay switches: to control luminaires located in less used walkways or
                                                  stairways by switching them off after a suitable time.

            gives reasons why installations are divided into circuits. The reasons are:
            ●    to minimise danger or inconvenience should a fault occur by keeping
                 other circuits, such as lighting circuits, operating if a fault occurs in
                 one single circuit, tripping its circuit protective device
            ●    to reduce the possibility of nuisance tripping of RCDs

             Band I                   A circuit operating at any voltage below low voltage (< 50 V AC or < 120 V DC). Such circuits could include
                                      telephone systems, data systems, extra-low voltage lighting and signal cables.
                                      Band I circuits shall never be in the same enclosure as Band II circuits unless they have the same degree
                                      of insulation.
             Band II                  A circuit operating at low voltage (> 50 V AC ), such as general lighting and power circuits.
             Safety circuit           A circuit operating fire alarm and emergency systems and which requires additional protective measures, such
                                      as separation from other circuits, so it is not affected by any faults on the other circuits. Further protection, by
                                      wiring the circuit in fire-proof cabling, may be considered. Other examples of safety circuits include centrally
                                      supplied emergency lighting, supplies to firefighters’ lifts and supplies to pumps for sprinkler systems.
             Essential circuits       These are supplies to equipment such as IT equipment or lighting in the stairwells of high-rise buildings.
                                      Essential circuits are dual supplied by the normal mains power and, in the event of power loss, a standby
                                      generator or uninterrupted power supply (UPS).
             Emergency                An emergency lighting circuit is normally one where emergency lights are supplied from a central source,
             lighting circuit         which could be a large battery set or generator.
                                      Sometimes it is also used when referring to part of a general lighting circuit, where sections may supply
                                      self-contained emergency lights and these are wired via a key-operated switch. This allows the emergency
                                      luminaires to be tested for function by taking away the power to them but leaving the general lighting on.
             Auxiliary circuits       Circuits that control a main circuit and are used for remote switching or monitoring of a circuit, such as
                                      a motor control circuit with remote start and emergency stop buttons. The auxiliary circuit is supplied
                                      from the main circuit but requires protection as it is normally wired using much smaller cable than the
                                      main circuit. Methods used to protect these circuits are given in Chapter 55 of BS 7671.
             Boiler control circuit   Where timers, thermostats or controllers are used to activate zone-control valves and boilers.
             Security circuits        For example, intruder alarm systems.
             Photovoltaic (PV)        These are the circuits that are supplied at DC from photovoltaic (solar) cells and are live all the time the PV
             circuits                 cell is exposed to light.
             Electric vehicle (EV)    A dedicated circuit to supply electric vehicle charging equipment designed to charge electric cars. These
             charging circuit         are now mandatory in new build housing having suitably accessible parking facilities.

                                                  Generally, the first unit in an installation where the supply is split into circuits is
                                                  called the consumer unit (CU). The CU will have protective devices inside, such as:
                                                  ●    circuit breakers (CBs)
                                                  ●    residual current breakers with overload (RCBOs)
                                                  ●    fuses.
                                                  These protective devices control and protect the circuits. We will explore them in
                                                  more detail later in this chapter (also refer to Chapter 3, pages 190–95).
                                                  Consumer units or distribution boards (DBs) need careful selection, taking into

                                                  The CU will have a main switch that can be used to isolate the entire

                                                  The main switch in a CU within a house must be the type that is rated to switch
                                                  the full load current. Some isolator devices which act as main switches within
                                                  DBs are not rated for full load current switching and if they were used regularly to
                                                  switch full load, they would eventually fail.

            ●    Modules – the amount of components that 1
                 can be fitted into the unit. For example, a    2
                 main switch controls both line and neutral     3
                                                                4
                 so is classed as a two-module device. A
                                                                5                                                             L N

                 If you needed a DB to control six circuits     E
                 and have a main switch, you would need an                  6    5   4              3    2    1

            ●    Ways – the amount of circuits that can be
                 controlled. A six-way single-phase board
                 could house six circuit breakers as well as
                                                                p Figure 5.6 Diagram of a split-way board showing three ways protected
                 the main switch. A six-way three-phase           by one RCD and three ways protected by another. In total, the DB is
                 board can house six three-phase circuit          12-module
                 breakers or 18 single-phase circuit breakers.
                 It could also house a combination of the
                 two, such as 2 × three-phase (six ways) and
                 12 × single-phase (12 ways).
            Some DBs are known as split-way boards. This means that some of the modules
            can be protected by one RCD or switch and the others by another RCD or switch.
            Split-way boards should always have one main switch that can isolate all circuits.

            Circuit protection
            The type of protective device chosen will depend on several factors, including:
            ●    the nature or type of load
            ●    the prospective fault current Ipf at that point of the installation
            ●    any existing equipment, such as an existing DB that can only accept a certain
                 type of device (providing it is suitable)
            ●    the user of the installation, as a CB is easier to reset than a bolted-type
                 high-rupturing capacity fuse.

            Protective devices are also selected for suitability against prospective fault current
            (PFC).
            Breaking capacity
            There is a limit to the maximum current that an overcurrent protective device
            (fuse or circuit breaker) can interrupt. This is called the rated short-circuit capacity
            or breaking capacity.

                                              Icn is the rated short-circuit capacity (marked on the device); Ics is the service short-circuit capacity.
                                              These are based on the condition of the circuit breaker after manufacturer’s testing.
                                              Icn is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely, although the breaker may no longer be usable.
                                              Ics is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely without loss of performance.
                                              The Icn value is normally marked on the device in a rectangle, e.g. 6000 . For the majority of applications,
                                              the prospective fault current at the terminals of the circuit breaker should not exceed this value.
                                              For domestic installations, the prospective fault current is unlikely to exceed 6 kA, up to which value the
                                              Icn and Ics values are the same.

                                              Regulation 434.1 in BS 7671 requires the prospective fault current under both
                                              short-circuit and earth-fault conditions to be determined at every relevant point
                                              of the complete installation. This means that at every point where switchgear
                                              is installed, the maximum fault current must be determined to ensure that the
                                              switchgear is adequately rated to interrupt the fault currents.
                                              From Table 5.7, it can be seen that BS 3036 devices have a very low breaking
                                              capacity compared with other devices. This is the main reason why these devices
                                              are no longer suitable for many installations.
                                              Circuit breakers have two short-circuit capacity ratings.
                                              ●    Ics is the value of fault current up to which the device can operate safely and
                                                   remain suitable and serviceable after the fault.
                                              ●    Icn is the value above which the device would not be able to interrupt faults
                                                   safely. This could lead to the danger of explosion during faults of this magnitude
                                                   or, even worse, the contacts welding and not interrupting the fault.
                                              Any faults that occur between these two ratings will be interrupted safely but the
                                              device will probably require replacement.

            Selectivity of protective devices
            There will usually be several stages of protection in large systems. It is therefore
            necessary to ensure that series protective devices disconnect properly in order to
            avoid unnecessary disconnection of parts of the system not directly associated
            with the fault or overload. The system designer should therefore pay particular
            attention to selecting the appropriate type and rating of protective devices.
            This requires knowledge of the protective device performance characteristics,                                          INDUSTRY TIP

            is faulty should be disconnected so that the remainder of the installation can
            continue to operate normally. It may be necessary
            to ensure continued functioning of the unaffected
            parts of the installation to prevent inconvenience or
            danger, such as a fault in a circuit causing lighting
            to be lost. By dividing the installation into circuits,
            including distribution circuits, we can minimise

                         INDUSTRY TIP           Circuit-breaker characteristics are different from those of fuses. The circuit breaker
                                                has two characteristic features:
              Where two RCDs are in series,
              such as one at the origin of      ●    a thermal characteristic similar to a fuse

              given in Regulation 536.4.1.4
              of BS 7671.                           ACTIVITY
                                                    Look at Appendix 3 in BS 7671. We can see that a 32 A Type D circuit breaker
                                                    will disconnect at a current of 640 A, whereas a 100 A Type B will disconnect
                                                    at 500 A fault current. This means that the 100 A device will disconnect before
                         INDUSTRY TIP               the 32 A device.
                                                    Have a look at some other devices and make similar comparisons between

                                                Devices selected for isolation or switching need to be rated for their particular
                                                expected use or located where use is restricted. If a device that is incorrectly rated
                                                is used for frequent switching, its terminals will degrade very quickly, leading to
                                                the risk of failure or fire.
                                                If a device is selected that is not rated for frequent use, it should be installed in a
                                                location where access is by authorised persons, to minimise the risk of danger.

            It is the conductor insulation that governs the overall capacity of a conductor,
            as it is the weak point. Copper can carry large currents before it reaches melting
            point but the insulation cannot. General thermoplastic insulation has a maximum
            operating temperature of 70°C, so it is this temperature that sets the current
            limit. It is assumed that the initial temperature of any conductor, and therefore
            insulation, is 30°C before any current is put through the conductor. As soon as
            current flows, the conductor temperature increases. The amount of current causing
            the temperature to reach 70°C is the upper limit of the conductor.
                                                                                                                                    30 °C                   0A

                                                            Where a cable is totally surrounded by thermal insulation, the cable’s ability
              Do not apply rating factors for               to dissipate heat is greatly reduced. As a result, rating factors for thermal
              thermal insulation if method                  insulation (Ci) need to be applied as the heat build-up in the cable will affect

              because thermal insulation                    surfaces, or should be sleeved by conduit as they pass through the thermal

              cable is totally surrounded by
              thermal insulation.                           As can be seen from Table 5.11 (below), a rating factor of 0.5 is applied to any
                                                            cable which passes through 500 mm or more thermal insulation. This effectively
                                                            reduces a conductor’s capacity by 50%, so thermal insulation is best avoided if
                                                            possible. The values in this table are also shown in Appendix 4 of BS 7671.

            Grouping of circuits
            Where circuits are grouped together, either in the same containment system such
            as conduit, or clipped close together on a wall, the heat from one circuit can have
            an effect on others. Rating factors for grouping (Cg) are applied to circuits using
            Table F3 of the IET On-Site Guide (reproduced as Table 5.12, below) or Table 4C1
            in BS 7671.
            As can be seen from the tables, the more circuits that are grouped, the more the
            conductor’s capacity is reduced. As an example, if a new circuit was installed into
            a cable basket with six other circuits, that would be seven in total. From the table,
            cables bunched in air (methods A to F) with a total number of circuits being seven
            has a rating factor of 0.54. This means that the conductor’s capacity is reduced to
            54% of the tabulated value.
            Cables of similar size and type should be grouped together, as mixing of circuits
            means that Table 4C1 cannot be used and different calculations are required.

               KEY FACT
               Different calculations
               Where a group contains a mixture of circuits of very different size and type – for
               example, a trunking (installed as method B) contains an 80 A distribution circuit, a
               40 A final circuit and a 6 A lighting circuit – the group rating factor can be found
               using:

                   Cg = 1
                         n
               Where n is the number of circuits in the group.
               So using the above example, which has three circuits that are not similar, the
               grouping factor would be:

                   C g = 1 = 0.58
                          3

                                                grouped (as method B).
                                                As a result, it is clearly beneficial to separate larger current circuits from
                                                smaller power circuits as the cables would require much harsher de-rating.
                                                When using the table, consider:
                                                ● where the horizontal clearance between cables exceeds twice their
                                                   diameter, no factor need be applied (for methods C, E and F)
                                                ● cables are assumed to be equally loaded. Where cables are expected to
                                                   carry no more than 30% of their grouped rating, they may be ignored so
                                                   far as grouping is concerned.
                                                The IET On-Site Guide and BS 7671 contain more conditions regarding
                                                grouping.
                                                30% grouped rating
                                                Some cables, such as those for lighting circuits, may never be loaded at full
                                                capacity and where a cable does not carry a current larger than 30% of its
                                                grouped rating, it can be ignored for grouping purposes.
                                                For example, a group of three single-phase circuits installed in trunking
                                                (method B) contained one circuit, which was expected to be wired in
                                                1.5 mm2 cable, and had a design current of 3 A.
                                                The value of It for the 1.5 mm2 cable is 17.5 A (from Table 4D1A) and the
                                                rating factor for three circuits is 0.7 from Table 4C1 or Table F3, so
                                                As
                                                   17.5 × 0.7 = 12.25 A

                                                12.25 A becomes its grouped rating, so
                                                   12.25 × 0.3 (to find 30%) = 3.68 A

                                                The design current for this circuit is 3 A and therefore less than 30% of the
                                                cable’s grouped rating.
              KEY TERM
                                                As a result of this, this circuit can be ignored as part of the group and therefore

            Simple single-circuit method of circuit design
            This method is suitable for most situations and particularly suited to sizing a single
            circuit where voltage drop should not be an issue. If voltage drop does prove to be
            a problem, this method may require several repetitive calculations. This method
            was commonly used when BS 3036 devices were popular, as the only way to
            apply the factor of 0.725 for this type of device is as a divisor, dividing it into the
            fuse nominal rating (In). As BS 3036 fuses are rarely used today, this method does
            not need to be applied.
            In order to determine a suitable conductor csa for a single-circuit cable, the
            following procedure is used.

            single-circuit cable step by step
            Step 1
            Determine the design current (Ib). This is determined in several ways depending on
            the type of load and the allowance, if any, for diversity.

            Select, using the correct column number relating to the installation method, a
            value of tabulated current equal to or larger than that calculated in step 4.
            This will now ensure that the cable selected is of suitable current-carrying capacity.

            Step 6
            Taking voltage drop into account, ensure that the selected csa of the conductor
            is appropriate. For the cable csa selection tables used in step 5, each has a
            corresponding voltage-drop table or column.
            The values given in these tables or columns represent the value of voltage drop, in
            millivolts per ampere per metre of circuit (mV/A/m).
            The circuit length determined in step 3 is required to determine voltage drop but
            remember that the circuit (cable) length is the length of the line conductor with
            the neutral, not added to the neutral. For example, if a twin cable has a cable
            length of 10 m, that is the length of the line with neutral.
            The line added to the neutral would be 20 m (there and back). The values of
            voltage drop per metre include the neutral resistance within the values.                            INDUSTRY TIP
            Apply the following formula to determine the value of voltage drop:                          If a final circuit is supplied
                  mV/A/m × length × design current (I b )                                                by a distribution circuit,

            Currently, Appendix 4 of BS 7671 states that values of voltage drop for an                   need to be taken into account.
            installation supplied from a public network should not exceed:
            ●     3% of the supply voltage for lighting circuits (3% of 230 V = 6.9 V)
            ●     5% of the supply voltage for power circuits (5% of 230 V = 11.5 V).
            As long as the voltage drop calculated for the selected cable csa is within the
            values above, the cable selected is suitable. If the calculated voltage drop is
            too high, the next largest csa is selected and calculated for voltage drop until a
            suitable csa is found.

                Example for the circuit design procedure
                A radial power circuit is to be installed in a surface-mounted trunking that
                contains four other circuits. The circuit is to be wired using single-core 70°C
                thermoplastic-insulated cable with copper conductors. The circuit is 15 m in
                length.
                The design current for the single-phase circuit (Ib) is 17 A and the ambient
                temperature is 25°C. Protection against overload and short circuit is by a Type B
                circuit breaker to BS EN 60898. As In ≥ Ib, then a 20 A device is selected.
                Using the information contained in Appendix 4 of BS 7671, the installation
                method is reference B from Table 4A2.

            Why use the grid method? When determining the csa of conductors for multiple
            circuits, the grid method is more efficient. If you are looking up rating factors for          Look at the opening
            grouping for one circuit, you may as well stay on that table and find them for                 paragraphs for Section 5
            20 circuits. It saves a lot of time.                                                           in Appendix 4 of BS 7671.
                                                                                                           It states there that the
            More importantly, this method of using the rating factors as multipliers is the only           multiplier method is the
            way to determine a value of Iz and some regulations in BS 7671 require the Iz value            method to use except for
            to be determined or compared with.                                                             when BS 3036 fuses are
            Also, in certain circumstances, voltage drop may be the key factor that determines             used, where it is more
            a cable csa because:                                                                           convenient to use the divisor
                                                                                                           method. It also clearly states
            ●    distribution circuits have consumed voltage, so the voltage drop limits are               that using the divisor method
                 smaller                                                                                   does not provide a value of Iz.
            ●    designers may set lower voltage-drop tolerances in order to save energy losses
                 as voltage loss contributes towards power loss
            ●    specific equipment may have voltage requirements that require less voltage
                 loss
            ●    the installation has an actual low supply voltage so, by design, voltage loss is
                 minimised.
            Within the grid, each column is given a number and the formula used in each case
            relates to the column number values.
            In addition, the grid is used to determine the csa of circuit protective conductors
            (cpc) for suitability for earth fault loop impedance and thermal constraints.
            The grid is a useful way to present and easily see the information for each circuit,
            just like a schedule of test results is easy to understand. We will be using one
            sample grid but there is nothing to stop you from making your own version.

            Completing the grid for live conductors
            The calculations that need to be made in order to complete the grid are multiple
            and often look complex. Looking at the grid in Figure 5.11a, you can note that
            each calculation has a number attached to it (e.g. calc 1): these indicate the order
            in which the calculations should be made or followed.
            You will see as we work through, that the formula includes wording in brackets,
            such as (col 1). This indicates you use the value from the column number for that
            value in the calculation.
            For example, where a calculation is required for column 12 (in yellow in Figure 5.11b), it
            shows you use calc (calculation) 2. Calculation 2 is:

                                 max volt drop (col 11) × 1000
                 max mV/A/m =
                                  I b (col 2) × length (col 10)

            So this would involve values being inputted into the formula from columns 11, 10
            and 2 (in green).
            Also note, where the word ‘stated’ is used, this would be a value from information
            or tables. Each step will explain the necessary values and where to find them.

                                                                                                                                          297

            The sample design grid is in two parts:
            ●                  sizing live conductors (columns 1 to 15)
            ●                  sizing of protective conductors and calculating earth fault loop impedance
                               (columns 16 to 26).
            We still need to apply knowledge learnt from the single-circuit method, such as
            why we apply rating factors and where to find them.

            The numbered points below refer to the column numbers in the sample grid and
            each has an explanation of what to insert in each case. In this section, we will
            cover columns 1–15 for live conductors.
            1 Insert the value of watts or kVA for the load. If there is no value to work with
              because you know the design current, leave this column blank.
            2 Determine Ib using one of the following formulae depending on the type of
              circuit and the type of load. If the design current is known, simply insert it.
              Whichever formula is suitable would be calculation 1 in the design grid and
              each formula is based on:

                                                 Alternatively, the voltage drop may be limited because a distribution circuit
                                                 supplies a distribution board (DB) and the final circuits on the DB must allow
                                                 for the voltage drop in the distribution circuit.

                                                 supplied by a distribution circuit which has a designed voltage drop of 2 V, that
                                                 only leaves 4.9 V permitted for the final lighting circuit. In this situation, 4.9 V
                                                 would be the maximum voltage drop that is inserted in column 11.

                                                 voltage drop.
                                                 A cable csa can be selected based on this value as long as the value in the

                 In the single-circuit method, we calculated actual voltage drop, using:
                                                                                                                   ACTIVITY

                                                           = voltage drop

                 So if we transpose this formula to:                                                               distribution circuit has a

                 we can determine the maximum permissible value of mV/A/m and base our                             the power circuit supplied
                 initial conductor csa on this.                                                                    from it?
                 That way, whatever conductor we end up using, as long as it is the same csa or
                 larger, it will be suitable for the maximum voltage drop permitted or required.
                 After a suitable cable has been selected, voltage drop can then be confirmed.
                 This is because the conductor selected will be suitable and any larger csa we
                 may select for current capacity will certainly be suitable as the voltage drop
                 will only reduce in value the larger csa of conductor we select.
                 To determine the maximum mV/A/m, apply:

                                 max voltage drop (col 11) × 1000
                 max mV/A/m =
                                    I b (col 2) × length (col 10)

               The value of mV/A/m is recorded in column 12.
            13 Then, go to the voltage drop tables and select a cable having an mV/A/m                                     INDUSTRY TIP
               lower than this calculated value.
               For example, if the calculation produced a result of 10 mV/A/m and a                                 Just a reminder where the
               single-core thermoplastic cable was to be installed, Table 4D1B is the table we                      cable-selection tables are in
               would use for voltage drop. If the circuit was single-phase as method B, we                          BS 7671:
               would look at column 3 and select a 6 mm2 conductor as it has 7.3 mV/A/m                             ● Table 4D1A/B for single-

              multiplying a value by 1                 ● Cg is the rating factor for grouping from column 8
              means it stays the same.

                                                not be suitable for current-carrying capacity as the Iz based on a 1.5 mm2

            Where the suitability of a ring-final circuit is being undertaken, the Iz calculated
            must be greater than 20 A in accordance with regulation 433.1.204.
            The maximum voltage drop in mV/A/m is calculated using the entire ring loop
            length. The max mV/A/m derived from the calculation is then divided by 4 and the
            resulting value used to select a cable csa.

              EXAMPLE: RING-FINAL CIRCUIT CALCULATION
              A ring-final circuit has the following conditions:
              l estimated design current (Ib) is 22 A

              l protective device is a 32 A Type B circuit breaker

              l the circuit has a 58 m loop circuit length meaning this is the length of cable
                 leaving the DB, supplying each socket outlet and returning to the DB
              l wired using single-core 70°C thermoplastic cables in surface trunking.

              We need to allow for two circuits grouped.
              Ambient temperature is taken as 25°C.
              Because a ring-final circuit cable shares the load through parallel conductors,
              Regulation 433.1.204 in BS 7671 requires the chosen conductors, after all
              conditions are taken into account, to have a capacity no less than 20 A.
              As the circuit is installed in surface trunking, the reference installation method is B.
              The ambient temperature is 25°C and from Table 4B1 in BS 7671, this has a
              factor Ca of 1.03. From Table 4C1, the factor Cg for two circuits grouped as
              method B (A-F) is 0.8 so
                       20        = 24.27 A
                 (1.03 × 0.8)

              From Table 4D1A of BS 7671, as it is single-core thermoplastic cable, single-
              phase method B (column 4), a cable that has a tabulated value exceeding this
              is 4 mm2 with a value of 32. The 2.5 mm2 cable is quite close to call and so
              going by the calculation that the minimum exceeds 24 A, this would not be
              acceptable.
              Alternatively, another suitable method to determine the minimum value is to take
              the value of It such as 24 A for the 2.5 mm2 conductor and apply the factors
              as multipliers to find the actual Iz rating of the cable. Remember the two rating
              factors needed are 1.03 (Ca) and 0.8 (Cg).
                     24 × 1.03 × 0.8 = 19.78 A
              As this is less than 20 A as given in Regulation 433.1.204, this is not acceptable
              so a 4 mm2 conductor is selected and
                         32 × 1.03 × 0.8 = 26.37 A
              As this is greater than 20 A, this is acceptable.
              To calculate the overall voltage drop: the value of mV/A/m for a 4 mm2
              conductor from Table 4D1B is 11 mV/A/m so voltage drop is
                   (11 × 22 × 58) = 14.04 V
                        1000
              but as it is a ring and the conductors are in parallel
                  14.04 = 3.51 V

                                              Considering circuit protective conductors
                                              Circuit protective conductors (cpc) need to be sized correctly for two reasons:
                                              ●   To ensure that the total earth fault loop impedance (Zs) is low enough to cause
                                                  disconnection of the protective device and therefore be in accordance with
                         INDUSTRY TIP             Tables 41.2, 41.3 and 41.4 of BS 7671
                                              ●   To ensure that the cpc can withstand the high fault current in the time it takes
              You should have studied             the protective device to disconnect without the conductor exceeding its final
              Chapter 3 of this book and          limiting temperature (the point at which the insulation melts). To prove this,
              have access to BS 7671              the cpc must be larger than the result of the adiabatic equation as represented
              and the IET On-Site Guide           in Chapter 54 of BS 7671.
              to understand and carry out
              these cpc calculations.         Before we continue with the calculations in the grid, we will once again look at
                                              how these values are designed.
                                              Total earth fault loop impedance (Zs) is the combination of the supply loop
                                              impedance external to the installation (Ze) and the resistance of the circuit line
                                              (R1) and cpc conductors (R2) so:
                                                  Z s = Z e + R1 + R 2

                                              Where:
                                              ●   Zs is the total earth fault loop impedance
                                              ●   Ze is the impedance of the supply loop external to the installation
                                              ●   R1 is the resistance of the line conductor(s) in the installation
                                              ●   R2 is the resistance of the cpc conductor(s) in the installation.
                                              In order to determine the R1 + R2 values, the following information is required:
                                              ●   cable length
                                              ●   cable conductor csa
                                              ●   cable insulation, which affects the maximum operating temperature of the
                                                  conductors
                                              ●   how the cable is installed or arranged
                                              ●   values of mΩ/m at 20°C from Table I1 in the IET On-Site Guide.
                                              Table I1 in the IET On-Site Guide gives values of R1 + R2 resistance for a 1 m
                                              section of cable at a temperature of 20°C. As the live conductors within a
                                              cable will rise in temperature as current passes through them, the operating
                                              temperature of the live conductors will have an effect on the temperature of the
                                              cpc depending on how the cpc is installed. If the cpc is bunched against the live
                                              conductors, such as the cpc in a flat-profile twin and cpc cable, the cpc will rise
                                              significantly in temperature compared with one that is run separately.
                                              To allow for a rise in temperature, and therefore a rise in resistance of the R1 + R2,
                                              which in turn will increase the value of Zs, a factor needs to be applied.

                                              Factor
                                              A factor is used to design a circuit R1 + R2 to allow for operational temperatures; it
                                              is referred to as the table I3 factor. This factor allows for the rise in temperature
                                              a cpc reaches during the normal operation of the live conductors. This is
                                              dependent on how the cpc is situated in relation to the live conductors, as it is the

                                                which is the same csa as the live conductors.
                                                On larger circuits, significant cost savings can be made by selecting a suitably
                                                sized cpc with a reduced csa. The problem with this is that you are working with a
                                                blank canvas and the Zs cannot be determined and verified without many hit and
                                                miss calculations. It is therefore better to work backwards, in this situation, using
                                                the maximum permitted Zs. This can be done by applying:

                                                                              Z s max − Z e
                                                    maximum R1 + R2 =                            × 1000 (in mΩ/metre)
                                                                           I 3 factor × length

                                                From this calculation, a suitable cpc csa can be selected from Table I1 of the IET
                                                On-Site Guide by ensuring that a cpc is selected, along with the live conductor csa
                                                (which has already been set), by selecting a mΩ/m value from the table less than
                                                the value from the calculation.

                                                using 70°C thermoplastic insulated 4 mm2 live conductors in surface conduit, the
                                                maximum Zs from Table 41.2 is 1.37 Ω and Ze is 0.24 Ω. The circuit is 18 m in
                                                length and is protected by a 32 A Type B circuit breaker to BS EN 60898.
                                                From Table I3, a factor for bunched 70°C thermoplastic cables is 1.2.
                                                So as:

                                                                                                                Chapter 5 Electrical installation design

            Then:

                    1.37 − 0.24 × 1000 = 52.31 mΩ/metre
                      1.2 × 18

            So, looking at Table I1 in the On-Site Guide, any shown combination of cpc can
            be used as they all have a combined value far below this calculated value. If a
            1.5 mm2 cpc is selected, it would have a combined resistance of 16.71 mΩ/m.
            If this 1.5 mm2 cpc is selected, the actual R1 + R2 would be:
                    16.71 × 1.2 × 18 = 0.36 Ω
                         1000

            And the Zs would be:
                    0.24 + 0.36 = 0.6 Ω

            This is below the maximum 1.37 Ω permitted and is therefore acceptable. But we
            knew it would be!
            Chapter 54 of BS 7671 requires the cpc for a circuit to be suitable for thermal
            constraints. This means that the cpc must be capable of carrying the fault
            current, for the duration of time it takes the protective device to disconnect,
            without the cable rising above its final limiting temperature (see Chapter 3 of
            this book). In simple terms, the protective device should disconnect before the
            cable insulation melts and the hot conductor becomes a high risk.
            To determine the minimum cpc csa suitable for this, the adiabatic equation is used
            as detailed in Chapter 54:
                        2
                    S= I t
                       k
            where:
            ●       S is the minimum cpc csa in mm2 suitable for thermal constraints
            ●       I is the actual fault current based on the circuit Zs
            ●       k is a constant value found in Tables 54.2 to 54.5 in BS 7671.

                Finding k: which table to use
                ●    Table 54.2 where the cpc is not bunched or incorporated into the cable. Examples include
                     a single-core cpc tied to an SWA cable or where the sheath of a MICC cable is used.
                ●    Table 54.3 where the cpc is bunched with live conductors or is incorporated into a
                     cable. This is the most commonly used table for all composite cables where a core is
                     used as a cpc or where cables are installed in trunking or conduit.
                ●    Table 54.4 where the armour or sheath of a cable, such as an SWA, is used as the cpc,

                ●    Table 54.5 where the metallic part of a wiring system is used as a cpc, such as conduit
                     or trunking.

            Using the earlier example, Zs was calculated as 0.6 Ω using a 1.5 mm2 cpc
            bunched in conduit, and protection was by a 32 A Type B circuit breaker.

            The City & Guilds Textbook: Electrical Installations Book 2

                                                 Looking at Table 54.2, for a bunched cpc, the value of k =115.
                                                 The fault current, which is dictated by the Zs, is found using simple Ohm’s law:

                                                       I =V
                                                          Z
                                                 So:
                                                       230 = 383 A
                                                       0.6

                                                 The value of t can be found using the time/current graphs in Appendix 3 of
                                                 BS 7671, or by consulting manufacturers’ information. Using Appendix 3, the
                                                 protective device in this example would disconnect within 0.1 seconds with a fault
                                                 current of 383 A.
                                                 So applying the adiabatic equation to determine the minimum permissible csa:

                                                         3832 × 0.1 = 1.05 mm 2
                                                           115

                         INDUSTRY TIP            As the selected cpc is 1.5 mm2, this is suitable.

              Remember, the numbered             Completion of the design grid for protective
              points below refer to each
              column in the design grid. We      conductors

                                                 Note, if the cpc csa is already given because the cpc is part of a cable and
                                                 therefore a fixed csa, the calculation in column 19 is not required.

               Insert the calculated Zs into column 22.
               Once the Zs has been calculated, we can compare the calculated value to

                 Providing that the cpc size calculated and inserted into column 26 is smaller in
                 csa than the one actually selected and recorded in column 20, the cpc selected
                 will be suitable under fault conditions.
            One of the key advantages of using the design grid method is seeing all the
            information together: an essential part of grid design is ensuring calculated values
            meet the requirements, and that simple format allows values to be compared easily.

                                                   We will now apply what we have learnt to the following example.
                                                   A circuit is to be designed to supply a 7.2 kW three-phase motor having a power
                                                   factor of 0.7. The circuit is to be wired using single-core 70°C thermoplastic

                                                   will be grouped with two other similar circuits.
                                                   The circuit is protected by a circuit breaker to BS EN 60898. Ambient

                                                      to be 5% of the supply voltage. As this is a three-phase supply, 5% of 400 V is
                                                      20 V. Based on the information gained so far, the grid should look like this:

            12 Determine the maximum voltage drop in mV/A/m to select a suitable
               minimum csa of conductor for voltage drop:

                                                                                  max voltage drop (col 11) × 1000

                               As the maximum voltage drop is 20 V as it is a three-phase 400 V circuit
                               (5% of 400 V):
                                                                                     20 (col 11) × 1000
                               max mV/A/m =                                                                  = 48.26 mV/A/m
                                                                                  14.8 (col 2) × 28 (col 10)

            13 To select a suitable csa of live conductors for voltage drop, look at Table 4D1B
               and select a value less than 48.26 from column 6 as it is a three-phase circuit
               and method B.
               Looking at the table, a 1 mm2 conductor or larger will be suitable for voltage
               drop and this can be recorded in column 13. This proves that any conductor
               which is finally selected for current-carrying capacity, providing it is equal to or
               larger than 1 mm2, will be suitable for voltage drop.
            14 However:
               Looking at the current capacities, from Table 4D1A: column 5, a 1 mm2
               conductor is only capable for 12 A. We know this is not suitable as the
               protective device is 16 A. Looking further down Table 4D1A, a 2.5 mm2
               conductor has an It value of 21 A, which is greater than 16 A, but to prove
               suitability we must ensure the Iz is greater than In:
                               Iz = It (col 14) × Ca (col 7) × Cg (col 8) × Ci (col 9)
                               So the only applicable factor is Cg
                               Iz = 21 × 0.7 (col 8) = 14.7 A
                               14.7 is less than 16 A; this is not acceptable so choose a 4 mm2 conductor
                               which has an It = 28 A
                               So:
                               Iz = 28 × 0.7 (col 8) = 19.6 A
                               19.6 A is larger than 16 A so this is acceptable for current-carrying capacity.

                                              15 In column 13, a 4 mm2 conductor can be inserted and in column 14, the tabulated
                                                 value for the cable which is 28 A. The calculated Iz of 19.6 can be inserted in
                                                 column 15.
                                                 To make some comparisons at this point, as we know a 1 mm2 conductor is
                                                 suitable for voltage drop, a 4 mm2 conductor certainly is and we have proven it
                                                 for current capacity as Iz is greater than In.

                                                 maximum disconnection time for this circuit is 0.4 seconds as it is a final

                                              17 To get the cpc size correct to the Zs, we need to determine the maximum
                                                 permissible Zs.
                                                 For this we look at Tables 41.2–4 (Chapter 41) depending on the protective
                                                 device and disconnection time:

                                                 So for a 16 A Type C device, the value of Zs = 1.37 Ω
                                              18 Using Table I3, the operating temperature factor for a 70°C thermoplastic

            21 To calculate the actual R1 + R2 the following formula is used:

                                actual R1 + R2 =                                                                                             = 0.56 Ω

               The calculated value of 0.56 Ω can now be inserted into column 21.
            22 Zs can now be determined by calculating:
                                Zs = Ze + R1 + R2 (col 21)
                                So:
                                0.12 + 0.56 = 0.68 Ω
                                The value of Zs calculated as 0.68 Ω can now be inserted into column 22. To
                                verify correct design, compare to the maximum permitted (column 17) and as
                                0.68 Ω is less than the permitted 1.37 Ω, this is acceptable.

                                                   on the value of fault current shown in column 23.
                                                   As the protective device is a 20 A Type C circuit breaker to BS EN 60898,
                                                   Table 3A5 is the particular graph needed. In this example, the actual fault
                                                   current of 338 A exceeds the value of current shown in the table which causes
                                                   the circuit breaker to disconnect instantaneously (0.1 seconds) which is shown
                                                   as 200 A. As a result, 0.1 s can be inserted into column 24.
                                                25 To calculate the adiabatic equation, we need to determine the value of k for
                                                   the type of cable used and how it is installed. As Table 54.2 is for cables which
                         INDUSTRY TIP              are bunched and referencing 70°C thermoplastic cable, the value of k that can
                                                   be recorded in column 25 is 115.
              Putting in the time to            26 Now we have the required information, the adiabatic equation can be

              IMPROVE YOUR MATHS
              Make use of your computer to ensure you keep your data safe and accurate.
              You can transfer the grid into a spreadsheet, input formulas into some of the
              cells, and the spreadsheet does the calculations for you.


                KEY POINT
                When undertaking the grid method, here are some final points to consider.
                ● If the calculated Zs is larger than the permitted Zs for the circuit from
                  Tables 41.2, 41.3 or 41.4, but the device is an RCBO and the Zs is
                  within values permitted in Table 41.5, always check that the circuit
                  has adequate short circuit protection using the adiabatic equation from
                  Chapter 43 of BS 7671 (return to Chapter 3 of this book).
                ● Always check suitability of a value before moving onto the next step.
                ● As mentioned at the start of this section relating to the design grid, if
                  you are researching values in BS 7671 for one circuit from a particular
                  table, find the values for all the circuits while on that table. This makes
                  designing multiple circuits much more efficient.


            Overload situations
            We discussed correct current coordination as we looked at the design process. As
            a reminder; for a circuit to comply with the requirements of Chapter 43, it must
            be correctly coordinated. This means that the protective device rating is suitable
            for the design current and the cable has a current capacity that is suitable for the
            protective device.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             315

                                              ●   Ib is the circuit design current
                                              ●   In is the rating of protective device
                                              ●   Iz is the current-carrying capacity of the conductor based on installed

                                              So in a normal circuit where overloads are not expected, as long as the circuit was
                                              coordinated, such as in the following example, the circuit is suitable.
                                              Example
                                              If we had a circuit that had a design current of 14 A, was protected by a 16 A
                                              device and the circuit cable had a current-carrying capacity, after consideration of
                                              the installed conditions, of 24 A, then this could be expressed as:
                                                  I b = 14 A < I n = 16 A < I z = 24 A

                                              But if that circuit was liable to overloads then:
                                                  16 × 1.45 = 23.2 A < 24 A I z

                                              So, in this situation, the circuit would also have capabilities for any potential
                                              short-term overloads.
                                              The reason for the 1.45 factor is that most protective devices would not
                                              reasonably disconnect at a current less than this. A quick look at Appendix 3
                                              shows that a 16 A Type B circuit breaker would not disconnect until approximately
                                              23 A is reached. Even then, it would take 10 000 seconds, which is approximately
                                              2 hours 45 minutes.
                                              So as long as the cable is capable of this current, it will not severely overheat.
              KEY TERMS                       Overload is not something that should be of concern in most circuits,

            operator (DNO). In order for them to provide an adequate supply for any new
            installation, they will need to review these figures.
            As it is unrealistic for all equipment to be used at the same time, diversity is
            applied. Diversity is a careful assessment of what, within an installation, would
            be used at any one time, including the durations of use, to determine the actual
            consumption needs. This assessment would be influenced by the type of premises.
            These might be, for example
            ●    domestic dwellings
            ●    small shops and offices
            ●    hotels
            ●    large commercial buildings
            ●    industrial facilities.
            As an example, a hotel could have 60 rooms all containing a 16 A radial circuit
            supplying socket outlets. The assumed maximum demand of these circuits alone
            would be:
                 16 × 60 = 960 A

            Obviously, these circuits will never be used at full load all of the time, so diversity
            is applied. Even though each room contains a TV, kettle and may have a laptop
            plugged in, the total loading at any one time is very unlikely to exceed 100 A.
            These assessments of actual demand are an example of diversity.
            As well as making an assessment for maximum demand and diversity for a new
            supply, other reasons may include:
            ●    installation of electric vehicle charging points
            ●    tariff assessments where green technology is installed, such as PV arrays
            ●    requiring a standby generator for when planned power outages occur
            ●    assessing the impact of additions to an existing electrical installation
            ●    fulfilling the requirements of Section 311 of BS 7671 when designing
                 installation work.

            Maximum demand
            Calculating the maximum demand for an installation is a relatively simple process;                 INDUSTRY TIP
            it is the sum of all the design currents of the individual final circuits per phase.

            Factoring circuits method of applying diversity
            With experience and the necessary information, a designer can make an
            assessment of the likely loading of a circuit.
            As an example, a 32 A ring-final circuit could be installed for the 1st floor of a
            dwelling with three bedrooms. At any one period, the likely demand on that
            circuit could be a TV, clock radios and some table lamps, so realistically, the
            demand would be no more than 6 or 7 A. Periodically, and for relatively short
            durations, a hairdryer may be used, taking demand to 16 A but for a very short
            time. As a result, the circuit is only demanding 22% of the design current, which
            equates to a factor of 0.22.
            Similarly, a socket-outlet circuit within a large open space, such as a restaurant,
            has many socket outlets but only for convenience of location and most are hardly
            used at any one time. In this situation, a factor of 0.1 could be applied to that
            circuit, meaning only 10% of the full load would be expected.

            Factoring installations method of applying diversity
            Many installations follow patterns of consumption, and as a result, DNOs and
            designers apply factors to the maximum demand based on the type and use of an
            installation. Some examples are shown below in Table 5.21.

            Using the previous example of the domestic dwelling, the calculation for factoring

            Although a DNO would normally provide a 63 A or 80 A supply, they would use
            this figure when assessing the demand on the substation transformer.

                                              Load control for domestic installations
                                              One of the problems when considering maximum demand in new housing is
                                              the added burden on the supply where electric vehicle charging is installed. On
                                              average, a vehicle charger may be rated at 7 kW which equates to 30 A being
                                              consumed during the initial part of the charging cycle. If this were to happen at
                                              the same time as an 8 kW electric shower (35 A) and a 7.6 kW induction hob (33
                                              A) the supply would not cope.
                                              There are two possible solutions to this.
                                              l   Supplementing the supply with photovoltaic (PV) solar panels and/or micro-
                                                  wind turbines. At times of less demand, these can also store the energy
                                                  generated into a battery storage system.
                                              l   Using smart metering in conjunction with load switching or smart charging
                                                  devices to stop vehicle charging during times of high consumption.
                                                  Alternatively, a charged vehicle can act as a storage system and provide
                                                  electricity for the installation at times of peak demand.

                                              In the UK, more and more people are living longer, independent lives in their
                                              own homes. Add to this the growing number of people (of all ages) with limited
                                              mobility also living more independent lives, the need for accessibility aids in the
                                              home increases.

            Approved Document M of the building regulations (England) does not give any
            requirements for accessibility aids in dwellings so the needs must be defined by
            the client and product manufacturer.
            Accessibility aids in dwellings that involve electrical work can include these features.
            l    Stair lifts: these are chair lift systems that run on a rail fitted to the side of
                 staircases. These are one of the most common forms of mobility aids in private
                 dwellings giving less able people the ability to move between floors using a
                 cost effective option.




            ▲ Figure 5.15 A chair-type stairlift
            l    ‘Between floor’ lifts: these are lift systems that pass through the floor to take
                 people between floors within a house. They can be built into a house as a
                 separate shaft but are more commonly retrofitted to existing houses. They
                 could be installed internally by cutting through the floor and installing an
                 (often transparent) shaft for the lift system. These lifts can also be installed
                 externally to the side of a building where openings need to be cut into the side
                 of a building to provide access to the internal floors. As these lifts are quite
                 slow speed and intended for one person at a time, possibly in a wheelchair,
                 power consumption is small and so can be added to an existing supply.
            l    Platform lifts: platform lifts are open lift systems and lift people between
                 floors or levels in an open space such as a hallway. As these are open, the
                 height they are used for is usually limited so the risk of a person dropping an
                 object onto others is reduced.

                                                    person from one place to another on an overhead rail system. Most commonly,

            INSPECTION, TESTING AND COMMISSIONING
            ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS



               INTRODUCTION
               Inspection, testing, commissioning and certification are very important stages of the safety process. Electricity
               can be very dangerous if the guidelines in BS 7671: 2018 (2022) The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition are
               not followed. Refer back to Chapter 3 of this book.
               Electrical inspection and testing can involve some degree of risk but if the guidelines are followed, the risk can
               be minimised. Every year, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigates many cases of injury due to bad
               practice and poor workmanship; electric shock, burns and fatalities can happen. Many electricians do not mean
               to make mistakes but they can happen, and on busy sites, other trades can damage electrical parts without
               realising, leaving dangerous situations. Many of these incidents can be corrected through good inspection and
               testing following the installation work.

                                              PREPARING FOR INSPECTION
                                              AND TESTING
                                              Inspection and testing can be a high-risk activity, not just for the inspector, but for
                                              anyone using or around the electrical installation being tested.
                                              In order to safely inspect and test, inspectors need to know and understand the
                                              regulatory requirements as well as having a good understanding of the installation
                                              being inspected. Information relating to the installation is essential in order to
                                              carry out effective inspections and tests. In this section we will consider all the
                                              safety aspects of inspection and testing as well as the information needed.

                                              How these regulations affect the inspection and
                                              testing process
                                              The EAWR affects the inspection and testing process as follows:
                                              l   Regulation 4(1) – identifies the need to ensure that new electrical installations
                                                  and circuits are subject to inspection, testing and commissioning before being
                                                  put into service.
                                              l   Regulation 13 – identifies the need for equipment to be ‘made dead’ during the
                                                  process of initial verification when undertaking dead tests. Isolation procedures
                                                  will need to be adopted.

                 the task. There are many types of electrician – industrial, commercial
                 and domestic, to name a few. When undertaking inspection, testing and
                 commissioning, the duty holder must have the appropriate knowledge and
                 experience of the system to work in a safe manner.

            The correct procedure for safe isolation
            Isolation can be very complex due to the differing industrial, commercial and
            domestic working environments, some of which require experience and knowledge
            of the system processes. This section deals with a basic practical procedure for
            the isolation and for the securing of isolation. It also looks at the reasons for safe
            isolation and the potential risks involved during the isolation process.

            How to undertake a basic practical procedure for
            isolation
            First, prepare all of the equipment required for this task. You will need the
            following equipment:
            ●    a voltage indicator which has been manufactured and maintained in                                      INDUSTRY TIP
                 accordance with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Guidance Note GS38
                                                                                                                You can download HSE GS38
            ●    a proving unit compatible with the voltage indicator
                                                                                                                free from the HSE website.
            ●    a lock and/or multi-lock system (there are many types of lock available)
                                                                                                                It is worth doing this and
            ●    warning notices which identify the work being carried out                                      becoming familiar with it.
            ●    relevant personal protective equipment (PPE) that adheres to all site PPE rules.

                                                   switches and isolators. To isolate individual circuit breakers with suitable locks and
                                                   locking aids, you should consult the manufacturer’s guidance. When working on or
                                                   near electrical equipment and circuits, it is important to ensure that:
              HEALTH AND SAFETY                    ●   the correct point of isolation is identified
              Always make sure you                 ●   an appropriate means of isolation is used
              check an approved voltage            ●   the supply cannot inadvertently be reinstated while the work is in progress
              indicator for damage                 ●   caution notices are applied at the point(s) of isolation
              before using each time.              ●   conductors are proved to be dead at the point of work before they are touched
              Any damage can lead to
              electric shock.
                                                   ●   safety barriers are erected as appropriate when working in an area that is open
                                                       to other people.

            1 Identify – identify equipment or circuit to be worked on and point(s) of
              isolation.
            2 Isolate – switch off, isolate and lock off (secure) equipment or circuit in an
              appropriate manner. Retain the key and post caution signs with details of work
              being carried out.
            3 Check – check the condition of the voltage indicator leads and probes. Confirm
              that the voltage indicator is functioning correctly by using a proving unit.
            4 Test – using voltage indicator, test the outgoing terminals of the isolation
              switch. Take precautions against adjacent live parts where necessary.

                                              When the ‘dead’ electrical work is completed, you must ensure that all electrical
                                              barriers and enclosures are in place and that it is safe to switch on the isolated circuit.
                                              ●     Remove the locking device and danger/warning signs.

                                              How these regulations affect the inspection and testing
                                              process
                                              The EAWR affects the inspection and testing process as follows.
                                              ●     Regulation 13 identifies the need for equipment to be ‘made dead’ during the
                                                    process of initial verification when undertaking dead tests. Isolation procedures
                                                    will be needed.
                                              ●     Regulation 14 acknowledges that during isolation, an electrician may be
                                                    working on or near live conductors.

                                              Safe isolation and implications
                                              When you isolate an electricity supply, there will be disruption. So, careful
                                              planning should precede isolation of circuits. Consider isolating a section of a
                                              nursing home where elderly residents live. You will need to consult the nursing
                                              home staff to consider all the possible consequences of isolation and to prepare a
                                              procedure.
                                              The following questions are useful before undertaking isolation to minimise issues:
                                              ●     How will the isolation affect the staff and other personnel? For example, think
                                                    about loss of power to lifts, heating and other essential systems.

            ●    How could the isolation affect the residents and clients? For example, some
                 residents may rely on oxygen, medical drips and ripple beds to aid circulation.
                 These critical systems usually have battery back-up facilities for short
                 durations.
            ●    How could the isolation affect the members of the public? For example, fire
                 alarms, nurse call systems, emergency lighting and other systems may stop
                 working.
            ●    How can an isolation affect systems? For example, IT programs and data
                 systems could be affected; timing devices could be disrupted.
            In this scenario, you must make the employers, employees, clients, residents and
            members of the public aware of the planned isolation. Alternative electrical back-
            up supplies may be required in the form of generators or uninterruptable power
            supply systems.


                VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS
                Remember to consider how any work might disrupt the client and make sure
                you communicate this clearly before commencing work.


            Before any isolation is carried out, you must assess the risks involved. This section
            deals with the practical implications and the risks involved during the isolation
            procedure, if risk assessment and method statements are not followed.

            Who is at risk and why?
            If isolation is not carried out safely, what are the possible risks when performing
            inspection and testing tasks?

            Risks to you
            Risks to you might include:
            ●    shock – touching a line conductor, e.g. if isolation is not secure
            ●    burns – resulting from touching a line conductor and earth, or arcing
            ●    arcing – due to a short circuit between live conductors, or an earth fault
                 between a line conductor and earth
            ●    explosion – arcing in certain environmental conditions, e.g. in the presence of
                 airborne dust particles or gases, may cause an explosion.
            Things that can cause risk to you include:
            ●    inadequate information to enable safe or effective inspection and testing, i.e.
                 no diagrams, legends or charts
            ●    poor knowledge of the system you are working on (and so not meeting the
                 competence requirements of Regulation 16 of EAWR)
            ●    insufficient risk assessment
            ●    inadequate test instruments (not manufactured or maintained to the standards
                 of GS38).

                                              ●   switching off electrical circuits – e.g. switching off a heating system might
                                                  cause hypothermia; if lifts stop, people may be trapped
                                              ●   applying potentially dangerous test voltages and currents
                                              ●   access to open distribution boards and consumer units
                                              ●   loss of service or equipment, e.g.:
                                                  ● loss of essential supplies

                                                  ● loss of lights for access

                                                  ● loss of production.


                                              Risks to members of the public
              HEALTH AND SAFETY               Risks to members of the public might include prolonged loss of essential power
              Note that, although safety      supply, causing problems, for example, with safety and evacuation systems,
              services usually have           such as:
              back-up supplies such as
              batteries, these may only       ●   fire alarms

              safety systems.                 ●   computers and associated IT equipment
                                              ●   residual current devices (RCDs) and residual current operated circuit breakers
                                                  with integral overcurrent protection (RCBOs)
                                              ●   heating controls
                                              ●   surge protection devices.
                                              There might also be risk of loss of data and communications systems.

                                                       INDUSTRY TIP
                If you think about it, any electrical product you buy comes with a safety certificate to say it
                is safe to use. Some products will need maintaining or repairing if they go wrong or become
                unsafe. An electrical installation is no different. Initial verification is the process to say the
                new installation is safe and suitable to be used, and periodic inspection and testing is part
                of the maintenance.


            When an installation undergoes initial verification, three signatures are required
            on the certificate to state the installation is safe and suitable. The three persons
            who sign the certificate are:
            ●     The designer – signs to state that the installation has been designed to be safe,
                  suitable for the intended use and to comply with current regulations. If any
                  part of their design does not comply with the regulations, they must declare                              KEY TERM
                  this as a departure. As long as the departure does not leave the installation                             Departure: A situation
                  any less safe than what the regulations require, this is acceptable.                                      where the regulations
                                                                                                                            could not be complied
            ●     The installer – signs to state that the installation has been constructed as
                                                                                                                            with. For example,
                  designed and to the current regulations. Like the designer, the constructor                               Section 701 of BS 7671
                  must declare any departures.                                                                              states that socket outlets
            ●     The inspector – signs to say that the inspection and testing process has been                             shall not be installed
                  undertaken and that the installation is safe and suitable for the intended use                            within 3 m of the edge
                  and complies with the current regulations and that any departures are as safe                             of zone 1 of a shower

            and non-statutory documents that relate to electrical installation work.                                        taken to make it safe,

            There are six statutory documents that you need to abide by:
            ●     The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSW Act) – imposes general
                  duties on employers to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of
                  all employees. These duties apply to virtually everything in the workplace,
                  including electrical systems and installations.
            ●     The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR) – concerned specifically with
                  electrical safety.

                 (MEIWC).
            An EIC is used to certify any new installation, rewires or
            the installation of any one circuit. It is also used to certify
            a change of consumer unit or distribution board.
            The MEIWC is used where an alteration or addition is
            made to an existing circuit, such as adding a light to
            an already working lighting circuit. If work involves
            alterations or additions to many circuits, an EIC could be
            used instead.
            All documents must be completed and authenticated by a
            competent person(s) before certification is handed over.
            Where additions to an electrical installation involve
            adding to several circuits, more than one MEIWC could be
            used, or an EIC could be used instead.

                The sample documents are shown in Figure 6.11 but always check you are using the latest
                forms, as found on the IET website under model forms. Also make sure you read any
                accompanying notes, which may not be shown here.
                These forms can also be found in Appendix 6 of BS 7671 and examples of completed
                documents are contained in the IET On-Site Guide or Guidance Note 3.


            Periodic inspection and testing forms
            Periodic inspection and testing is carried out to assess the on-going safety of
            existing electrical installations.
            The following forms are blank samples. These forms are not classed as
            certification; they are reports relating to the condition of the electrical
            installation. The extent and limitations of the report must be agreed with the
            person ordering the work. The reasons for these limitations must be validated.
            While this chapter focuses on the initial verification process, it is a good idea to
            see the forms used for periodic inspection and testing in order to understand how
            they differ. More information on periodic inspection and testing will be covered in
            Chapter 7, including reporting unsafe situations and the use of the report codes.
            The schedule of test results used for a periodic inspection and test is the same as
            that used for an EIC.
            All documents must be completed and authenticated by a competent person(s)
            before a full report is handed over.
            Documentation to be completed for periodic inspection and testing can also be
            found in Appendix 6 of BS 7671 and on the IET website:
            ●    Electrical Installation Condition Report
            ●    Condition Report Inspection Schedule(s)
            ●    Generic Schedule(s) of Test Results, and circuit details (which is the same as
                 that used for an EIC).


                KEY TERMS
                Extent: The amount of inspection and testing. For example, in a third-floor
                flat with a single distribution board and eight circuits, the inspection will be
                visual only without removing covers and testing, and will involve sample tests
                at the final point of each circuit.
                Limitation: A part of the inspection and test process that cannot be done for
                operational reasons. For example, the main protective bonding connection to
                the water system, located in the basement, could not be inspected as a key
                for the room was not available.
                There are two types of limitations:
                ● Agreed limitations which are made before work begins. This may be, for
                    example, where a certain safety circuit cannot be turned off.
                ● Operational limitations which are situations that arise during the work.
                    This could be, for example, where a room was supposed to be inspected,
                    but the person with the key was not available so access was not possible.

                                                                                                                                                   343

            Before carrying out an initial verification of an electrical installation, you need the
            following information, in accordance with BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations,

            Maximum demand and diversity (Regulation 311)
            The maximum demand of a new installation must be assessed. Appendix A of the
            IET OSG provides details of the methods used to calculate the maximum demand                          KEY TERM

            The assessed demand after diversity must be inserted on the Electrical Installation
            Certificate. This information should be provided by the designer but in many cases,
            the maximum demand is based on the rating of the supplier’s fuse.                                             INDUSTRY TIP

                                                 THE INSPECTION PROCESS
                                                 Much emphasis is put on testing installations as it is probably seen as the more
                                                 technical side of the process, but it must be remembered that testing only re-
                                                 enforces the results of an inspection. The inspection is an incredibly important
                                                 stage and detailed inspection of a new installation should occur during and on
                                                 completion of the work.
                                                 In this section we will look at what needs inspecting, how we do it and what
                                                 human senses we use throughout the inspection.

                                                 Human senses and inspection
                                                 Human senses, your sight, touch, hearing and smell, are vital to the inspection
                                                 process. You need to know which senses are involved and be able to explain how
                                                 to use them.
                         INDUSTRY TIP

            Sight
            Sight is the most extensively used sense. It is used when:
            ●    connecting conductors
            ●    identifying circuits
            ●    routing cables
            ●    labelling circuits
            ●    correctly connecting accessories
            ●    identifying signs of burning or overheating due to bad connection.

            Touch
            Touch is used in:
            ●    connection of conductors (using a screwdriver to check the connections)
            ●    correct connection to equipment (e.g. in the physical connection to a water
                 pipe)
            ●    erection methods (e.g. fixings for distribution boards (DBs)/conduits/trunking)
            ●    checking of barriers and enclosures (check for IPXXB and IPXXD in accordance
                 with Regulation 416.2)
            ●    checking for careless work methods (sharp edges in conduit)
            ●    detecting overheating of equipment.

            Hearing
            Listening can detect:
            ●    arcing caused by loading, e.g. when switching on and off fluorescent fittings
            ●    equipment noise, such as a motor bearing problem that causes a loud
                 grinding sound
            ●    arcing caused by insecure connections, e.g. at an accessory, junction box
                 or distribution board.

            Smell
            Smell is used to detect:
            ●    equipment that is overheating
            ●    loose connections under load conditions
            ●    burning of adjacent building materials, e.g. recessed lights without fire
                 protection.

            Inspection items explained
            Regulation 642.3 in BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations, lists items that should be
            checked during the inspection. The list is not entirely compatible with the schedule
            of inspections for new works. The schedule uses these items but targets them to
            specific areas within the installation. Later we will see the schedule and how to use
            it but here we will take a simplistic look at the items listed in Chapter 64.
            Below is a summary, with brief description, of what should be inspected to ensure
            the safety of an installation as detailed in Chapter 64. The list is not necessarily
            in the same order nor complete as some of the common specific inspections are
            detailed within the schedule of inspections later in this section.

                                               Chapter 64 is the first Chapter in Part 6 of BS 7671 and details the requirements for
                                               initial verification. So why doesn’t Part 6 start with Chapter 61? Well, in the 17th Edition it
                                               did, but Part 6 was reordered in the 18th Edition to include the reporting and certification
                                               requirements in the correct chapter. As this meant merging three chapters into two, it was
                                               decided to create two new chapter numbers to highlight the changes. As a result, Chapters 61
                                               to 63 have now been deleted.


                                               ACTIVITY
                                               As you go through the list of inspections, consider what human sense you would
                                               use to carry out the inspection.


                                              (i) Connection of conductors
                                              Every connection between a conductor and equipment (or another conductor)
                                              should provide durable electrical continuity and adequate mechanical strength.
                                              (ii) Identification of cables and conductors
                                              Check that each core or bare conductor is identified as necessary.
                                              (iii) Routing of cables
                                              Cables and their cable management systems should be designed and installed to
                                              take into account the mechanical stresses that users will place on the installation.
                                              (iv) Selection of conductors for current-carrying
                                              capacity and voltage drop
                                              Where practicable, the cable size should be assessed against the protective
                                              devices for the circuit. In cases of doubt, the inspector should check this against
                                              the design to confirm the installer has followed the design.
                                              (v) Connection of single-pole devices for protection or
                                              switching in line conductor only
                                              Checking that switches and protective devices are controlling or protecting the
                                              line conductor. This can also be verified through testing.

                                              (vi) Correct connection of accessories and equipment
                                              Correct connection (suitability and polarity) and environmental conditions, such
                                              as the presence of dust or moisture, must be checked.

                                              (vii) Presence of fire barriers, suitable seals and
                                              protection against thermal effects
                                              Fire barriers, suitable seals and/or protection against thermal effects should be
                                              provided. These checks should be carried out during the installation process.

            (viii) Methods of protection against electric shock
            There are two general methods against electric shock. Basic protection, which
            protects against shock through contact with parts that are normally live, and fault
            protection, which is protection against parts made live due to a fault.

            a. Both basic and fault protection
            This applies where SELV, PELV or double and reinforced protection is used for basic
            and fault protection. SELV and PELV systems use extra-low voltages where double
            and reinforced protection is the use of class II protection.

            b. Basic protection
            Basic protection is most commonly provided by insulation of live parts and/or
            barriers and enclosures:
            ●    Confirmation of the insulation of live parts should be carried out to ensure no
                 damage has occurred during the installation process.
            ●    Barriers and enclosures need to be checked to ensure a protection level of at
                 least IPXXB or IP2X. For horizontal top surfaces of readily accessible enclosures,
                 you must ensure at least IPXXD or IP4X.
            The illustrations and tables that follow explain the IP codes designated
            numbering and lettering system.
            IP codes indicate the degree of ingress protection. Figure 6.14 (below) shows the
            designated numbers and letters in the code, and Table 6.2 shows the characteristic
            numerals. Where a characteristic numeral does not have to be specified, it can be

                                                     Protection against access with a finger can be assessed using the British Standard
                                                     finger (IPXXB), as shown in Figure 6.15.
                                                     Remember that the IP codes are used in conjunction with basic protection, as a
                                                     guide to protection against contact with live parts and ingress of foreign bodies.
                                                     Note also that providing obstacles and placing installations out of reach are
                                                     methods of protection against contact, but they can only be used as a method of
                                                     protection in a controlled and supervised environment.

            c. Fault protection
            Fault protection inspection involves ensuring that earthing                                                               12 mm
            arrangements are in place. Part of this process includes automatic
            disconnection of supply, selection of protective devices and
            disconnection times, which will undergo further inspection and
            verification as you progress through the tests.
            There are also some specialised systems of electric shock protection                                                                Swivel joints
            which are rarely used. They can be found in Section 418 of BS 7671
            and include:
            ●    non-conducting location                                                                              Finger shield
            ●    earth-free local equipotential bonding

            ●    electrical separation for the supply to more than one item of
                 current-using equipment.
            Electrical separation for the supply to one item of equipment is more common.
            This may include the shaver point in a bathroom and confirming it is installed in
            the correct zone and complies with the correct standards.
            Automatic disconnection of supply
            The most common form of fault protection is automatic disconnection of supply
            (ADS). In order for ADS to be effective, a system of earthing and bonding is
            required.

            To inspect the earthing and bonding, the following is inspected:
            i. Presence of earthing conductor (shown as a 16 mm2 cable)
               ● Check that the cable is continuous from the origin of the supply to the

                  main earthing terminal (MET), consumer unit or distribution board.
               ● Ensure that the connections are secure.

               ● Ensure that the cable fixings are adequate.

               ● Verify the cross-sectional area of the conductor and compare with

                  calculation or selection in accordance with Regulation 543.1.1.

                                                                                                                                                                  355

                  should be provided as a means of isolation and of interrupting the supply on
                  load. For single-phase household and similar supplies that may be operated
                  by unskilled persons, a double-pole device must be used for both TT and TN
                  systems. For a three-phase supply to an installation forming part of a TT
                  system, an isolator must interrupt the line and neutral conductors. In a TN-S or
                  TN-C-S system only the line conductors need be interrupted as the installation
                  has a reliable connection to earth.

            ●     For every item of equipment – all fixed electrical equipment should be
                  provided with a means of switching which can be used for the safety and
                  maintenance of systems, from industrial production equipment to individual
                  items, such as immersion heaters, hand dryers and showers.
            ●     For every motor – every fixed electric motor should be provided with a
                  readily accessible and easily operated device to switch off the motor and all
                  associated equipment, including any automatic circuit breaker.
            ●     For every supply – all isolators must be labelled or identified, if it is not
                  obvious which circuits they control.

                                                      INDUSTRY TIP
                An isolator is a mechanical switching device which, in the open position, complies with the
                requirements specified for the isolating function. Most isolators are manufactured to switch
                on/off the supply during no-load conditions. The switching and control devices for the
                equipment must be used to de-energise the load before the isolator switching mechanism
                is opened. One of the most common causes of burnt-out terminals and conductor insulation
                within an isolator is not a loose terminal, as most would suspect, but the fact the isolator is
                being used as an on-load switch, which the device is not designed to do.
                Part of the inspection process is to ensure that any device that is likely to be used
                as a switch within an installation, is actually rated as a switch. Always check the
                manufacturer’s information regarding the rating of the device for switching.

                                                   Amendment 2 of BS 7671 introduced a new type of Electrical Installation
                                                   Certificate that contains the Schedule of Inspections within it. When completing
                                                   the schedule of inspections, you should undertake this using the checklist in

                                                   Here we will look at the schedule of inspections checklist that is specifically for
                                                   initial verification purposes. If a periodic inspection and test is undertaken, a

                     INDUSTRY TIPS                 When completing a schedule of inspection for an Electrical Installation Certificate,
                                                   boxes must be marked with either a tick for compliance, or as not applicable
              Unlike SELV and PELV, a              (n/a). No box should be marked as ‘unsatisfactory’ and anything found to be

              4.2        Barriers and enclosures                All barriers and enclosures provide adequate protection stopping contact with
                                                                live parts. This would include checking the correct level of IP protection such

                                                                these items must be located in a generally inaccessible location, such as a

              4.3        Obstacles                              These two methods of protecting persons from contact with parts intended to

             5.1         SELV                                   Separated extra-low voltage circuits must be supplied by a suitable device,
                                                                typically a transformer, which provides suitable separation. In addition, any
                                                                metallic parts of a SELV system must be separated from earth. An inspection of

                                                                required (414).
             5.2         PELV                                   Protective extra-low voltage circuits are similar to SELV but in PELV systems,

             5.3         Double insulation i.e. Class II        Rarely used in most installations, Class II protection ensures the risk of parts
                         or equivalent equipment and            becoming live is minimised by having basic insulation and further level of
                         associated circuits                    insulation or reinforced insulation. Where these circuits exist, the system would
             5.4         Reinforced insulation i.e. Class       have to be under effective supervision by skilled persons (412). These may be
                         II or equivalent equipment and         used where, for example, the length of a circuit would not provide a low enough

                                                                such as a medical location, and the risk of electric shock is reduced to a

             5.7         Electrical separation                  The inspector must check that the device providing separation is a transformer
                                                                to the correct BS standards, such as that for a shaver point. If the separated

                                                                covered in Section 8 later in this document. This box is ticked to confirm the

                                                     TESTING
                                                     Testing follows inspection and is intended to support the inspection. In order
                                                     to test effectively, inspectors need to be methodical, checking everything. It is
                                                     important to note that the initial verification testing of an installation is probably
                                                     the only time a full test is undertaken as future periodic testing will likely only
                                                     be sampling. For that reason, comprehensive and reliable test results must be
                                                     obtained during initial verification, ensuring all points are tested.
                                                     In addition, inspectors must consider their test instruments and the sequence of
                                                     testing.

            Appropriate tests and sequence for
            electrical installations
            The tests which need to be carried out during initial verification are listed below.
            Some of the tests will not be applicable to all electrical installations.

            Regulation section 643 – prescribed tests
            The sequence of dead tests must be undertaken in the sequence shown below, as
            the result of one test, such as insulation resistance, relies on the reliable results of
            another, such as continuity.
            The tests shown in red are rarely undertaken as those of 643.4 can normally
            be verified by inspection only and 643.5 is only applicable where the protective
            measure is a non-conducting location, which is a very rare installation. 643.11 is
            rarely actually undertaken if the installation has been designed correctly and this
            can be verified by design. This test will be briefly explained.

                                                    Test instruments
                                                    There are many different styles and manufacturers of test instruments. Many
                                                    instruments are multifunction testers but some are still standalone testers.
                                                    Whichever type you use, the preparation and safety requirements are almost the
                                                    same. Efficient and safe testing relies on instruments being accurate, compliant
                                                    with safety requirements and prepared for the test to be undertaken.

            3 Calibration
            ●    Calibration must be carried out on each piece of test equipment in accordance
                 with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
            ●    Regular checking may be carried out using known references.
            ●    Usually, annual calibration suffices, unless the instrument is subject to
                 excessive mechanical stresses.

                                        This general series guidance note is aimed at people (including electricians,
                                        electrical contractors, test supervisors, technicians, managers, tradespeople and/

                                        electrical systems and equipment. This fourth edition is updated to include current
                                        test equipment; the guidance has not fundamentally changed from the previous
                                        version.

                                        The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 require those in control of all or part of an
                                        electrical system to ensure it is safe to use and maintained in a safe condition.

                                        activities to be carried out on electrical equipment or systems, this includes
                                        electrical testing and fault finding. Wherever possible, all work on electrical systems
                                        should be carried out with the system dead. This includes electrical testing where
                                        dead tests are often as effective as live measurements. This document provides
                GS38 (Fourth edition)   advice and guidance on how to achieve this.

            The tests
            In order to obtain the most accurate results, the testing must be performed in
            particular ways to minimise factors that can affect the results, such as parallel
            paths.
            Remember that the first tests are ‘dead’ tests and therefore it is assumed that safe
            isolation has been carried out. The state of the supply in terms of isolation for the
            ‘live’ tests will be explained for each test.

                                                So, as an example, a 10 mm2 conductor has a resistance of
                                                1.83 mΩ/m and a length of 12 m so:

              What is recorded                  No results are recorded but on the EIC, you tick the box
                                                confirming the continuity has been verified.
              Verifying results                 GN3 states the resistance of the clamp should be in the
                                                order of 0.05 Ω, so if the conductor in the example above
                                                was tested with a probe connection on the pipework, the
                                                reading expected should not exceed:
                                                0.02 Ω + 0.05 Ω = 0.07 Ω
                                                Generally, values below 0.1 Ω are considered suitable.
              Something to consider             If the bonding was not disconnected, parallel paths would exist.
                                                Imagine, in the diagram above for a single-phase installation,
                                                that there was a gas-fired water boiler connecting the gas and
                                                water pipes together. If the bonding of one conductor was
                                                measured without any disconnection, the path measured would
                                                also be through the other bonding conductor in parallel. This
                                                would have the effect of almost halving the result.

                                           a danger of testing at a conductor by colour and not the labelled

              Test                        Continuity of cpc for radial circuits
              Something to consider       The use of the R2 method is not encouraged during an initial
                                          verification but mixing the methods is probably the most
                                          effective way to test.
                                          For several reasons explained below, it is encouraged to obtain
                                          R1 + R2 values for the circuit but if you are in a room and want
                                          to verify a metal switch or metallic parts and accessories of a
                                          system are connected to earth, you could use a wander lead (or
                                          just the test leads depending on distance) to check the cpc links
                                          the light and switch or metallic parts, etc. without the need to
                                          open accessories to get to the line conductor.
                                          The reasons why obtaining R1 + R2 is better are:
                                          ● Having R1 + R2 results will make earth fault loop testing
                                            much easier later in the sequence
                                          ● When periodic testing is undertaken in the future, R1 + R2
                                            results are good benchmark figures to have. When you consider
                                            earth fault loop impedance is the sum of the R1 + R2 and the
                                            external loop impedance (Ze), the Ze can vary depending on
                                            system loading, voltage variations and modifications to the
                                            supply system. This in turn will affect Zs but the R1 + R2 should
                                            never change (unless of course someone alters the circuit but                      INDUSTRY TIP
                                            that should be tested afterwards). So if someone later gets
                                            higher Zs values, they can measure R1 + R2 to see if the reason
                                            for this is circuit deterioration.
                                                                                                                       Remember:
                                          ● By measuring R1 + R2 and successfully checking switching                       Zs = Ze + R1 + R 2
                                            opens the circuit, polarity is also confirmed.

                                               the distribution board in order to carry out this test. It is best to leave socket outlets connected
                                               and in place.
              Health and safety                The circuit must be isolated.
              considerations
              Method                           This test is undertaken in three steps.
                                               Step 1 – Test end-to-end resistance of the ring at the distribution board between the disconnected
                                               conductors and note down the readings as:
                                               ● Line to line: r1
                                               ● Neutral to neutral: rn
                                               ● cpc to cpc: r2
                                               The readings taken should be the same if all conductors have the same csa and are correctly
                                               wired. If the cpc has a reduced csa, the reading r2 will be proportionately higher. If the live
                                               conductors are 2.5 mm2 and the cpc is 1.5 mm2, the resistance r2 should be 1.67 × r1 as the csa
                                               of the line conductor is 67% bigger than the cpc.

                                                 IMPROVE YOUR MATHS
                                                 The difference in resistance is proportional to the difference in csa for conductors.
                                                 If you divide 2.5 by 1.5 you get 1.67, meaning that a 2.5 mm2 conductor is
                                                 67% bigger than a 1.5 mm2 conductor. If you multiply the resistance of the
                                                 2.5 conductor by 1.67 (increasing by 67%) you get the resistance of the 1.5
                                                 conductor. So what are the resistance differences for 4/2.5 mm2 conductors?

                                               If any result is higher than expected, once all the results are gathered, check to see if the socket
                                               outlet where higher results were obtained is wired as a spur.
              What is recorded                 The results of step 1 are recorded on the schedule of test results as r1, r2 and rn.
                                               The highest reading obtained during step 3 of the test between line and cpc is recorded as the circuit R1 + R2.
                                               If all results were as expected, the circuit polarity can be confirmed by ticking the polarity column.
              Verifying results                Providing the results are consistent and as expected, the ring can be verified as correct and
                                               polarity of all the sockets can also be confirmed, providing the tests at the sockets were carried
                                               out using a plug adaptor.
              Something to consider            If results were not as expected, ensure that you note down all readings before trying to chase a
                                               fault. By having all readings, you are in a better position to judge what the fault is.
                                               For example, if we consider the expected results from the examples above but the results at one
                                               socket outlet were actually:
                                               Line to neutral (step 2) – open circuit (no reading)
                                               Line to cpc (step 3) – 0.54 Ω
                                               We would, without getting the results of step 3, start making an assumption that the socket was
                                               either disconnected or the line or neutral was an open circuit. By getting the result of step 3, a
                                               better judgement can be made.
                                               Looking at all the results, it could be concluded that the line and cpc were wrongly connected at
                                               the socket, giving an incorrect polarity.
                                               As we get a reading between line and cpc as expected, if the connections at the back of the
                                               socket were the wrong way round, we would get the same result as if they were correct.
                                               However, we got an open circuit between line and neutral because we were actually testing neutral to cpc.
                                               It is possible that the neutral has become disconnected, but if that was the case, we would not
                                               have got an rn reading at step 1.
                                               Because of the possibility of faults, it is a good idea to produce a table to note down the results
                                               at each socket for each step. Some schedules of tests results produced by industry organisations
                                               already have these printed on the back.

                               In addition, ensure that when you test a circuit, make sure the button is
                               released on the tester before moving the probes. When certain cables are
                               tested, such as SWA or MICC cables, they can act like capacitors storing
                               a charge. This charge could be released into someone if they came into
                               contact with the conductors, causing electrocution. By releasing the test
                               button on the circuit, most test instruments will also discharge any energy
                               stored by the cables. Circuits may also have capacitors installed which
                               could also release dangerous charges introduced by the test.

                                                              When testing an entire installation, it is good practice to record one result
                                                              per column and indicate that this covers all circuits. If a result is entered for

                                                              The value recorded is dependent on the maximum value the instrument
                                                              can read. Some instruments can read up to 999 MΩ, so the value recorded
                                                              would be > 999. Other instruments can read up to 200 MΩ, so the value
                                                              recorded would be > 200.
                                                              If a reading value was obtained that was within the instrument range, then
                                                              the lowest reading is recorded.
                                               Expected       All results should be as high as possible and, ideally, above the value that
                                               results        the instrument can read.
                                                              As a rule, if a value below 2 MΩ is recorded for an entire installation, each
                                                              circuit should be tested to ensure that the cause isn’t one single circuit at fault.
                                                              Results, such as 0.03 MΩ (30 000 Ω), could indicate something has been

                                 When testing an entire installation, the overall value could be lower than
                                 expected because all the circuits under test are in parallel and, as we know                              20 MΩ
                                 from our science knowledge, the more resistances we have in parallel, the

              Reasons for the test               To ensure circuits that rely on electrical separation are reliably separated from the source circuit
                                                 and any other parts of the installation.
                                                 This test is rarely carried out as it can mainly be verified by inspection. By checking that the
                                                 secondary circuit is physically not in contact with any other circuit or earthed parts, separation
                                                 can be confirmed. If, however, the secondary circuits share a containment system with other

                                                 circuit test (leads together).
                                                 As this test uses voltages exceeding 120 V DC, the instrument and leads must be GS38 compliant.
              Circuit preparation                The supply of the primary source circuit must be isolated.
                                                 Disconnect the transformer providing electrical separation and link the live conductors of the
                                                 primary circuit together, then link the live conductors of the secondary circuit together.
                                                 Ensure no loads are connected to the secondary circuit.
              Health and safety                  The high voltages used for this test are a risk, not only to the inspector, but also anyone else in the
              considerations                     area. GS38 must be observed with regards to test leads and instruments.
              What is recorded                   There is no provision to record these results, so a remark can be made in the remarks column,
                                                 giving the lowest results.
              Expected results                   Any result below 1 MΩ is not acceptable and separation is not adequate.

            At this point in the testing sequence, the main dead tests are done and the
            installation is safe to energise to carry out live tests, unless the installation is TT
            and relies on an earth electrode as the means of earthing. Before we continue
            with the testing methods, it is a good idea to revise earth fault paths and why
            they are so important to test.

            Methods of determining earth fault loop
            paths
            There are three types of system earthing arrangements to consider:
            ● TN-S

            ● TN-C-S

            ● TT.

            There are three methods of determining the external earth fault loop impedance (Ze).
            ●    Measurement: by testing at the origin of the installation – this is the most
                 common and accurate method used.
            ●    Enquiry: such as by contacting the electricity distributor, who will usually
                 quote the maximum possible Ze value in accordance with the Electricity Safety,
                 Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002; you will require permission to use
                 this system.
            ●    Calculation: this is the most complex method and can only be used if the
                 designer knows all of the relevant impedances and resistances of the system to
                 be tested.

            TN-S system and earth fault loop impedance
            This section concentrates on the TN-S system. TN-S systems may be
            three-phase or single-phase.
            Three-phase supply for a TN-S system
            The three-phase supply for a TN-S installation is shown in Figure 6.32. The
            electricity distributor will supply the consumer with an earth, which is separated
            throughout the system but connected to the neutral at the centre point of the
            supply transformer.

                                              Single-phase supply for a TN-S system
                                              This is typical of a domestic (or similar) installation. In both single- and
                                              three-phase supplies, a TN-S system will normally use the sheath of the supplier’s
                                              cable as a means of earthing the installation. From this sheath, the earthing
                                              conductor will connect to the installation’s main earthing terminal (MET). An
                                              enquiry to an electricity distributor regarding the characteristics of a domestic
                                              supply will result in them declaring the external earth fault loop impedance

                                              TN-C-S system and earth fault loop impedance
                                              This section concentrates on the TN-C-S system (PME). There are three methods
                                              of determining the earth fault loop impedance (Ze).
                                              ●   Measurement: by testing at the origin of the installation – this is the most
                                                  common and accurate method used.
                                              ●   Enquiry: such as by contacting the electricity distributor, who will usually
                                                  quote the maximum possible Ze value in accordance with the Electricity Safety,
                                                  Quality and Continuity Regulations.
                                              ●   Calculation: this is the most complex method and can only be used if the
                                                  designer knows all of the relevant impedances and resistances of the system to
                                                  be tested.

            Single-phase TN-C-S system
            In both three- and single-phase cases the electrical distributor will supply
            the consumer with an earth which is connected to the neutral at the origin
            of the installation. The neutral is connected to the centre point of the supply
            transformer. As the neutral now doubles as an earth, it is referred to as a
            protective earthed neutral (PEN) conductor. In the UK the most common earthing
            arrangement is now TN-C-S, or PME.
            New supplies will almost always be PME to provide for a TN-C-S system.
            An enquiry to an electricity distributor for the characteristics of a domestic supply
            will result in them declaring the external earth fault loop impedance (Ze) = 0.35
            Ω, the maximum for PME supplies (TN-C-S systems). The Ze value in practice will
            normally be considerably less than 0.35 Ω.
            Protective multiple earthing is a system where multiple earth electrodes
            are installed to provide an alternative path to the star point of a substation
            transformer. As the PEN conductor is both a live conductor and earth, if this
            conductor becomes part of an open circuit in the supply, earthed parts of the
            installation may become live as current tries to find a path back to the substation.
            This situation is known as neutral current diversion.
            Remember, if current flows into a circuit, the same current flows back on the
            neutral. If this neutral becomes open, that current needs an alternative path and,
            as the earthing of the installation is connected to the supplier’s neutral, this may
            provide the path needed.
            If the supply contains multiple earth electrodes, this risk is reduced as the
            electrodes should provide a more suitable return path.

            TT system and earth fault loop impedance
            A TT system is a system in which the electrical distributor does not supply the
            consumer with an earth. This may be because they can’t guarantee the continuity
            of a protective conductor, such as in the case of a low-voltage supply to a
                                                                                                                                                             385

                                              disconnected during adverse weather conditions.
                                              TT systems may also be used on construction sites, caravan parks, marinas
                                              and many other locations. This is because the Electricity Safety, Quality and
                                              Continuity Regulations will not permit the connection of PME supplies to certain
                                              locations. So, the supplier does not give an earth in these situations and it is up to
                                              the consumer to provide an earth using an earth electrode.
                                              Generators may also use TT-type systems in order to provide an alternative,
                                              reliable earth path. If a generator is installed for standby purposes, and the power
                                              is lost, the generator starts up. This generator must have an independent earth as

                                                               For example, if a circuit was protected by a 32 A Type C circuit breaker,

                                                               So any test value of Zs in this situation should not exceed 0.54 Ω.

                                               consider        were calculated using Ze added to the R1 + R2, the test value will likely be
                                                               lower than the calculated value as the live test also takes in parallel paths. This

                                                               If you carry out a live test of EFLI on a ring-final circuit, the test value will

              Meter to be used       Prospective fault current tester
              Meter preparation      Some meters give prospective fault current readings when set to test
                                     earth fault loop impedance. Ensure you are familiar with your test
                                     instrument and always read the instructions.
                                     If a test instrument requires three leads to carry out this test, ensure
                                     you know what it is testing in terms of L-N or L-E. If in doubt, double
                                     up the earth and neutral leads so they are connected to the same
                                     terminal when testing.
              Circuit preparation    Ideally, the supply is isolated.
                                     Ensure that everything, including the earthing conductor, is
                                     connected. Do not do this test as part of a Ze test. This is because Ze
                                     has the earth removed but prospective fault current needs all parallel
                                     paths included as this could raise the fault current.
              Health and safety      Never unnecessarily expose yourself to live terminals and always take
              considerations         extra care when testing live.
                                     As this is a live test, instruments and leads must comply with GS38.

                                              neutral at the furthest point in the circuit.
              What is recorded                No results are recorded but if the voltage drop exceeds permitted values, the circuit must be
                                              corrected before certification is issued.
              Expected results                This depends on circuit length and conductor csa.
                                              Voltage drop can be calculated using the measured value, circuit design current (Ib) and the use
                                              of a temperature factor. The temperature factor is applied to adjust the measured resistance of
                                              the no-loaded circuit to that of a fully loaded circuit. The normal factor applied to do this is 1.2 to
                                              simulate a temperature rise from 20°C to 70°C.
                                              The voltage drop can then be calculated by:

                                              (R1 + Rn ) × Ib × 1.2 = voltage drop (V)
                                              Consider a power circuit has a design current of 15 A and R1 + R2 was measured as 0.34 Ω at
                                              20°C. The voltage drop would be:
                                              0.34 × 15 × 1.2 = 6.12 V
              Verifying results               The voltage drop of a circuit must not exceed that given in Appendix 4 of BS 7671 for installations
                                              connected to a public supply, which are:
                                              ● 3% of the supply voltage for lighting circuits, which is 6.9 V for a 230 V supply and
                                              ● 5% of the supply voltage for power circuits, which is 11.5 V for a 230 V supply.
                                              As our example was 6.12 V and the circuit is a power circuit, this is acceptable.
              Something to consider           Testing for voltage drop is generally not required for an initial verification if the installation has
                                              been designed correctly and installed as per the design. It may, however, be required for periodic
                                              inspection and testing if it is thought that equipment isn’t functioning correctly, such as dim lights
                                              or heaters not heating up correctly.


                                                   Completed documentation
                                                   All electrical installation work must be designed, constructed, inspected and
                                                   tested. When the inspection and testing is complete, the customer will be supplied
                                                   with the relevant copies of the certification.

                                                   Electrical Installation Certificate
                                                   An Electrical Installation Certificate is a safety certificate issued to confirm that
                                                   the electrical installation work to which it relates has been designed, constructed,
                                                   inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations. As
                                                   part of the certification, the Schedule of Circuit Details and the Schedule of Test
                                                   Results must be completed with satisfactory outcomes.
                                                   The recipient should receive an ‘original’ certificate and the contractor should
                                                   retain a duplicate. If you are the person ordering the work, but not the owner of

            the installation, you should pass this certificate, or a full copy of it including the
            schedules, immediately to the owner.
            The ‘original’ certificate should be retained in a safe place to be shown to any person
            inspecting or undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If
            the property is later vacated, this certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that
            the electrical installation complied with the requirements of BS 7671 at the time the
            certificate was issued. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations require
            that, for a project covered by those regulations, a copy of this certificate, together with
            schedules, is included in the project health and safety documentation.

            Minor Electrical Installations Works Certificate
            A Minor Electrical Installations Works Certificate will be issued to confirm that
            the electrical installation work to which it relates has been designed, constructed,
            inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations.
            Similarly, the recipient should receive an ‘original’ certificate and the contractor
            should retain a duplicate and, if necessary, the original certificate should be passed
            to the owner.
            A separate certificate should be received for each existing circuit on which minor
            works have been carried out. This certificate is not appropriate if the contractor
            has undertaken more extensive installation work, for which an Electrical
            Installation Certificate is required.
            As above, it should be retained in a safe place, displayed to any person inspecting or
            undertaking further work on the electrical installation, and if the property is later
            vacated, it will provide proof that the minor electrical installation work carried out
            complied with the requirements of BS 7671 at the time the certificate was issued.

            Schedule of Inspections
            The Schedule of Inspections is completed as part of the Electrical Installation
            Certificate. This document must be completed with no faults recorded.

            Generic Schedule of Test Results
            The Schedule of Test Results is completed and supplied as part of the Electrical
            Installation Certificate. This document must be completed with no faults
            recorded and presented as part of the Electrical Installation Certificate. Complex
            installations may require more than one Schedule of Test Results. One schedule
            must be completed for each distribution board and consumer control unit
            (including distribution circuits).
            Accompanying each Schedule of Test Results should be the Schedule of Circuit
            Details which carries all the information needed for each circuit.

            Commissioning equipment
            It is vitally important to follow manufacturers’ documentation when setting up
            and commissioning electrical and electronic equipment. These instructions should
            be passed on to the client for future needs. They should form part of an Operation
            and Maintenance (O&M) manual.

            ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAULT DIAGNOSIS AND
            RECTIFICATION



               INTRODUCTION
               There are many types of fault that can occur in electrical circuits. These include not only the failure of physical
               components but also errors that may have been introduced during the original design or installation. This
               chapter will help you understand the principles, practices and legislation associated with diagnosing and
               correcting electrical faults in accordance with statutory and non-statutory regulations and requirements.
               This knowledge underpins the application of skills used for fault diagnosis and correction in electrotechnical
               systems and equipment in buildings, structures and the environment.

            Health and safety legislation
            The basic concept of ‘health and safety legislation’ is to provide the legal
            framework for the protection of people from illness and physical injury that
            may occur in the workplace. The Health and Safety at Work Act (HSW) 1974 is
            the basis of all British health and safety law. It provides a comprehensive and
            integrated piece of legislation that sets out the general duties that employers have
            towards employees, contractors and members of the public, and that employees
            have to themselves and to each other. These duties are qualified in the HSW Act
            by the principle of ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’. What the law expects is
            what good management and common sense would lead employers to do anyway:
            that is, to look at what the risks are and take sensible measures to tackle those
            risks.
            The person(s) responsible for the risk and best placed to control that risk are                KEY TERMS
            usually designated the duty holder. The HSW Act, which is an enabling act, is                  Duty holder: The person
            based on the principle that those who create risks to employees or others in the               in control of the danger

                                              The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 are the main statutory regulations that
                                              deal with work on electrical systems and require people in control of electrical
                                              systems to ensure they are safe to use and maintained in a safe condition.

                                              Statutory regulations covering building types
                                              Maintenance activities, such as periodic inspection and testing, are made
                                              mandatory in some buildings due to statutory regulations covering these buildings.
                                              Examples of these regulations include:
                                              ●   the Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England)
                                                  Regulations 2020
                                              ●   the Management of Houses of Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2020.
                                              In addition, local authorities place a duty on some buildings to be regularly
                                              maintained, and this again can be proven by undertaking periodic inspection and
                                              testing at regular intervals. Examples of these are buildings requiring a licence
                                              such as:
                                              ●   buildings selling alcohol
                                              ●   places of public entertainment
                                              ●   petrol filling stations
                                              ●   touring caravan parks.
                                              Generally, all commercial buildings are classed as places of work, so Regulation 4
                                              of the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 states the need for these buildings to
                                              be maintained to a safe condition.
                                              Many hazardous installations, such as chemical plants, are covered by specific
                                              statutory regulations and some of these are detailed in Appendix 2 of BS 7671.

                                              One very good example of guidance and non-statutory regulations is BS 7671, more
                                              usually known as the ‘IET Wiring Regulations’. BS 7671 is the national standard in the
                                              United Kingdom for low-voltage electrical installations. The regulations deal with the
                                              design, selection, erection, inspection and testing of electrical installations operating at
                                              a voltage up to 1000 V AC and 1500 V DC.
                                              If electrotechnical work is undertaken in accordance with BS 7671 it is almost

            on or near equipment that is thought to be dead but which is in fact live, or                  it to be live or dead.
            the equipment is known to be live but those involved in the work do not have
            adequate training or appropriate equipment, or they have not taken adequate
            precautions.
            Regulation 4(3) of the EAWR requires that every work activity, including
            operation, use and maintenance of a system and work near a system, shall be
            carried out in such a manner as not to give rise, so far as is reasonably practicable,
            to danger.
            The EAWR provides for two basic types of system of work: work on de-energised
            conductors (Regulation 13) and work on live conductors (Regulation 14).
            Regulation 13 covers the preferred system of working, which is to remove the
            danger at source, i.e. by making the conductors dead. Regulation 14 requires
            adequate safeguards to protect the person at work from the hazards of live
            conductors.
            Many accidents to electricians, technicians and electrical engineers occur when
            they are working on equipment that could have been isolated. In most cases,
                                                                                                           KEY TERM
            adequate planning and work programming will allow such jobs to be carried out as
            the regulations require, i.e. with the equipment dead and isolated.                            Isolation: The

            Switching is cutting off the supply while isolation is the secure disconnection
            and separation from all sources of electrical energy. A variety of control devices
            is available for switching, isolation or a combination of these functions, some
            incorporating protective devices.
            Before starting work on a piece of isolated equipment, checks should be made,
            using an approved testing device, to ensure that the circuit is dead. See below
            for details of a standard isolation procedure. There are also secondary hazards
            associated with electrical testing that must be considered when risk assessments
            and a safe work practice document are being prepared.

            An incorrect isolation procedure may also present a risk of damage
            to electrical equipment and to building fabric.

            Safe working procedures for fault
            diagnosis
            Electricity is a safe, clean and powerful source of energy and is in
            use in practically every factory, office, workshop and home in the
            country. However, this energy source can also be very hazardous –
            with a risk of causing death, if it is not treated with care. Injury can
            occur when live electrical parts are exposed and can be touched,
            or when metalwork that is meant to be earthed becomes live at a
            dangerous voltage.
            The possibility of touching live parts is increased during electrical
            testing and fault-finding, when conductors at dangerous voltages
            are often exposed. This risk can be reduced if testing is done
            while the equipment is isolated from any source of electrical
            supply. However, this is not always possible and, if this is the
            case, it is important to follow procedures that prevent contact
            with any hazardous voltages internal to the system.
                                                                                        Figure 7.1 Make sure all precautions are taken
            But before fault finding and testing work commences, reference
            must be made to the following relevant legal duties.
            ●    The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR)
                 ● This is the principal legislation relating to work on electrical systems.

                 ● Regulation 4(3) requires that: ‘work on or near to an electrical system shall

                    be carried out in such a manner as not to give rise, so far as is reasonably
                    practicable, to danger’.
                 ● The regulations provide for two basic types of system of work: work on

                    de-energised conductors (Regulation 13) and work on live conductors
                    (Regulation 14).
            ●    The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
                 ● These require employers to assess the risks to the health and safety of their

                    employees while they are at work, in order to identify and put in place the
                    necessary precautions to ensure safety.
                 ● Depending on the extent of the work, this requires either a formal written
                    risk assessment or one that relies on a generic system for simple work
                    activities. A sample risk assessment is shown in Figure 7.2.

            A permit to work (PTW) procedure is a specialised written safe system of work
            that ensures potentially dangerous work, such as work on high-voltage electrical
            systems (above 1000 V) or complex lower-voltage electrical systems, is done safely.
            The PTW also serves as a means of communication between those controlling the
            danger (the duty holder) and those who carry out the hazardous work.
            Essential features of PTW systems are:
            ●    clear identification of who may authorise particular jobs (and any limits
                 to their authority), and who is responsible for specifying the necessary
                 precautions
            ●    that the permit should only be issued by a technically competent person, who
                 is familiar with the system and equipment, and who is authorised in writing by
                 the employer to issue such documents
            ●    provision of training and instruction in the issue, use and closure of permits
            ●    monitoring and auditing to ensure that the PTW system works as intended
            ●    clear identification of the types of work considered hazardous
            ●    clear and standardised identification of tasks, risk assessments, permitted task
                 duration and any additional activity or control measure that occurs at the
                 same time.
            A PTW should state clearly:
            ●    the person the permit is addressed to, that is the person carrying out the work
                 or the leader of the group or working party who will be present throughout the
                 work
            ●    the exact equipment that has been made dead and its precise location
            ●    the points of isolation
            ●    where the conductors are earthed (on high-voltage systems)
            ●    where warning notices are posted and special safety locks fitted
            ●    the nature of the work to be carried out
            ●    the presence of any other source of hazard, with cross-reference to other
                 relevant permits
            ●    further precautions to be taken during the course of the work.

                                              The effective operation of a PTW system requires involvement and cooperation
                                              from a number of people, and the procedure for issuing a PTW should be written
                                              down and adhered to.

                                                  Ensure that the instructions on the permit to work are written in clear language
                                                  so there is no chance of misunderstanding what is required.

                                              Before fault diagnosis is carried out, the safe working arrangements must be
                                              discussed and agreed with the client and/or the duty holder (or responsible person

                                                  When communicating with the client or duty holder, make sure you do so in a
                                                  clear, concise and courteous manner. This demonstrates your professionalism,

                                                   the installation is being tested. It is good practice to make sure the client
                                                   understands any effects this could have on their day to day routine to

                                              This ensures that everyone who is concerned with the work understands what
                                              actions need to be taken, such as:
                                              ●     which areas of the installation may be subject to disconnection

            ●     who might be affected by the work
            ●     health and safety requirements for the site
            ●     which area will have restricted access
            ●     whether temporary supplies will be required while the fault diagnosis is
                  underway
            ●     reaching agreement on who has authority for the diagnosis and repair.
            It may be that a specific person has responsibility for the safe isolation of a
            particular section of an installation and that person should be identified and the
            isolation arrangements agreed. By entering into dialogue with the client before
            work commences, the potential for unforeseen events will be minimised and good
            customer relations will be fostered. For example, in an office block where the
            electrical installation is complex and provides supplies to many different tenants
            located on a number of floors, the safe isolation of a sub-circuit for testing
            purposes may require a larger portion of the installation to be turned off initially.
            In order to achieve this with minimal disruption, an agreement must be reached
            between the competent person tasked to carry out the work and the person
            responsible for the installations affected. This responsible person could be the
            office manager, the designated electrical engineer for the site or, in some cases,
            the landlord of the building.

                HEALTH AND SAFETY
                You should appreciate the difference between ‘the duty holder’ and ‘the
                responsible person’.
                ● The person in control of the danger is the duty holder. This person must be
                   competent by formal training and experience and with sufficient knowledge to
                   avoid danger. The level of competence will differ for different items of work.
                ● The person who is designated the responsible person has delegated
                   responsibility for certain aspects of a company’s operational functions, such
                   as fire safety, electrical operational safety or the day-to-day responsibility for
                   controlling any identified risk, such as Legionella bacteria.



                                                     INDUSTRY TIP
                The Electricity at Work Regulations considers a competent person as someone with suitable
                knowledge and experience to carry out the work. BS 7671 no longer refers to a person as
                ‘competent’ but instead uses the terms ‘Skilled Person (electrically)’ and ‘Instructed Person
                (electrically)’.
                ● A skilled person is someone who, like a competent person, has suitable knowledge and
                    experience but the definition goes further, stating that the skilled person must also
                    be able to perceive (understand and be aware of) the risks electricity can create in all
                    situations.
                ● Instructed persons are those that have knowledge and experience in particular tasks
                    but cannot necessarily perceive the risk when those situations change.

            Everyone involved in the work (e.g. client, electrician and those in the workplace)
            has a responsibility for their own health and safety and that of others who may be
            affected by the work.

            Instruments have to be calibrated under laboratory conditions, against standards
            that can be traced back to national standards; therefore, this usually means
            returning the instrument to a specialist laboratory.
            Once calibrated, the instrument will have a calibration label attached to it, stating
            the date the calibration took place and the date the next calibration is due. It will
            also be issued with a calibration certificate, detailing the tests that have been
            carried out, and a reference to the equipment used.
            Instruments that are subject to any electrical or mechanical misuse (e.g. if the
            instrument undergoes an electrical short circuit or is dropped) should be returned
            for recalibration before being used again.
            Electrical test instruments are relatively delicate and expensive items of
            equipment and should be handled with care. When not in use, they should be
            stored in clean, dry conditions at normal room temperature. Care should also be
            taken of instrument leads and probes, to prevent damage to their insulation and
            to maintain them in safe working condition.

            Check test leads
            Make sure that these and any associated probes or clips are in good order,
            are clean and have no cracked or broken insulation. Where appropriate, the
            requirements of the HSE Guidance Note GS38 should be observed for test leads.

            Select appropriate scales and settings
            It is essential that the correct scale and settings are selected for an instrument.
            Manufacturers’ instructions must be observed under all circumstances.

            Tools and equipment

                                              Injuries associated with tools and equipment
                                              The most common injuries from the use of hand tools are:
                                              ●   blows and cuts to the hands or other parts of the body
                                              ●   eye injuries due to the projection of fragments or particles
                                              ●   sprains due to very abrupt movements or strains
                                              ●   contact with live conductors.
                                              The principal causes of injury are:
                                              ●   inappropriate use of the tools
                                              ●   use of faulty or inappropriate tools
                                              ●   use of poor-quality tools
                                              ●   not using personal protection equipment

                                              Almost 25% of all reportable accidents involve portable electrical equipment, the
                                              majority being caused by electric shock. Electrical equipment that is hand held or
                                              being handled when switched on presents a large degree of risk to the user if it
                                              does develop a fault.

                                              The principal causes of accidents are:
                                              ●   use of damaged, defective or unsuitable equipment
                                              ●   lack of effective maintenance
                                              ●   misuse of equipment
                                              ●   ‘unauthorised’ equipment (e.g. electric heaters, kettles, coffee percolators,
                                                  electric fans) being used by employees
                                              ●   use of power tools in a harsh environment (construction sites, etc.).

            not know it had been replaced three times before. In other words, no pattern of
            failure is recognised.
            When things get recorded, patterns of failure can be identified, and suitable action
            taken, such as re-siting the socket or installing a more robust metal socket. It may

            Electrical Installation Condition Report
            The Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) should only be used for
            reporting on the condition of an electrical installation. It is intended primarily for
            the person who is ordering the work (the client, duty holder or responsible person
            for the installation) and anyone subsequently involved in additional or remedial
            work. Its purpose is to confirm, so far as is reasonably practicable, whether or not
            the electrical installation is in a satisfactory condition for continued service.
            As BS 7671 is non-statutory there is no legislative requirement which

            An Electrical Installation Condition Report will have attached to it a set of
            guidance notes explaining the purpose of the report. When an electrical fault
            has been diagnosed, identified and then repaired, BS 7671 requires that the
            circuit, system or individual piece of equipment be inspected and tested and that
            functional tests should be carried out.
            Depending on the extent of the fault and subsequent repair, either an Electrical
            Installation Certificate (EIC) or a Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate

                                              Electrical installations degrade with time due to physical damage to switches,
                                              sockets and other fittings, together with deterioration of cables. The severity of
                                              degradation is more pronounced in installations within buildings where:
                                              ●   construction work is in progress
                                              ●   adverse elements (such as corrosive chemicals or extreme temperatures) are
                                                  involved
                                              ●   maintenance has been poor.
                                              To ensure the safety of everyone who may come into contact with an electrical
                                              installation, such as users or people who undertake maintenance, it is vital that
                                              the installation is regularly inspected and tested to identify any faults or potential
                                              failures. Regulation 4(2) of the EAWR (1989) states: ‘As may be necessary
                                              to prevent danger, all systems shall be maintained so as to prevent, so far as
                                              reasonably practicable, such danger.’

                                              Report codes
                                              As its title suggests, the EICR is a report, not a certificate. It relates to an
                                              assessment of the in-service condition of an electrical installation against the
                                              requirements of the issue of BS 7671 current at the time of the inspection,
                                              irrespective of the age of the installation.
                                              The results, measurements and values taken during the inspection and testing
                                              are clearly recorded in a report and the associated schedules. Appropriate
                                              recommendations, if applicable, are made to rectify any damage, deterioration or
                                              defects, dangerous conditions and non-compliance with the requirements of the
                                              regulations that may give rise to danger.
                                              The EICR contains 11 sections, which are identified alphabetically from A to K.
                                              Section K, ‘Observations’ has two columns to be completed. Observation(s) are
                                              entered in the first column. The second column requires a classification code
                                              (C1, C2 or C3) with reference to the observation(s).
                                              In some situations, there are limitations to the inspection and testing. This could
                                              be something like:
                                              ●   not able to gain access to a particular room as nobody has the keys

                                              Code C1: danger present
                                              This code indicates that there is a risk of injury and that immediate remedial
                                              action is required to remove the dangerous condition.
                                              Code C1 allows those carrying out an inspection to report to the client or
                                              responsible person that a risk of injury exists, which could be, for example,
                                              accessible live conductors due to damage, poorly modified enclosures or removed
                                              maintenance panels. Incorrect polarity would also attract a Code C1 as it may
                                              allow conductive parts, not normally expected to be live, to become live.
                                              A reported Code C1 warrants immediate action to be taken. This involves
                                              immediately informing the client or responsible person for the installation, both
                                              verbally and in writing, that a risk of injury exists. A detailed explanation of this
                                              risk should be recorded on the report, together with details of any verbal and
                                              written warnings. If possible, dangerous situations should be made safe or rectified
                                              before further work or inspections are carried out.

            Alternatively, if an unsafe situation can be made good at a low cost or with ease,
            such as replacing a simple light switch or replacing a cover which has not been
            properly fitted, this is the preferred method. If a simple fix is all that is required,
            that doesn’t remove the need to document the situation. All discoveries that are
            dangerous must be documented.

            Code C2: potentially dangerous
            This code indicates that urgent remedial action is required. The EICR should
            declare the nature of the problem, but not the remedial actions required.
            The phrase ‘potentially dangerous’ indicates a risk of injury from contact with
            live parts following a ‘sequence of events’. A sequence of events could mean
            that an individual would need to move, open or gain access to live parts when
            undertaking a daily task that would not normally be expected to give access to
            live parts.
            An example of this would be an isolator with a damaged casing, in a locked
            cupboard. This might leave exposed live parts. But these could only be accessed
            with the use of access equipment, such as a specialist tool or key. An individual
            would need to gain access to the cupboard before coming into contact with live
            parts, but nevertheless the potential for risk of injury is high.
            The lack of an adequate earthing arrangement for an installation, the use of utility
            pipes as the means of earthing or an undersized earthing conductor (in accordance
            with BS 7671 Regulation 543.1.3) would also warrant a Code C2 because a
                                                                                                              ACTIVITY

            For items classified as ‘potentially dangerous’ (C2), the safety of those using
            the installation may be at risk and it is recommended that a competent person
            undertakes any necessary remedial work as a matter of urgency.

                                              If this potentially dangerous situation can be rectified by an addition or a simple
                                              alteration to the installation, the client will probably request that this is carried
                                              out. It should be remembered that this is not part of the initial agreement. If the
                                              work does not involve major system changes, such as the installation of a new
                                              circuit, then a MEIWC should be issued. Remember an EIC is to be used only for
                                              the initial certification of a new installation or for an alteration or addition to an
                                              existing installation where new circuits have been introduced.

                                              Code C3: improvement recommended
                                              This code implies that, while the installation may not comply with the current
                                              edition of the regulations, it does comply with a previous edition and is deemed
                                              safe, although improvements could be made. An example could be where an
                                              installation not modified in recent years has cables concealed in a wall that are
                                              not provided with additional protection by an RCD.
                                              For items classified as Code C3, ‘improvement recommended’, the inspector
                                              has found some problems that are not immediate risks but may become risks if
                                              not improved. One example may be that the inspection has found circuits that
                                              have not got ‘additional protection’, as required by current regulations. This isn’t
                                              necessarily unsafe but could be improved.
                                              For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be re-inspected at
                                              appropriate intervals by a competent person. The recommended date by which the
                                              next inspection is due should be included in the report, under ‘Recommendations’,
                                              and on a label near to the consumer unit or distribution board.
                                              The time period to the next inspection is a decision made by the inspector. If an
                                              inspector found several C3 non-compliances, this duration would be shorter than
                                              finding one C3.

                                              Actions to be taken in response to Report Codes issued
                                              An EICR is intended primarily for the person who is ordering the work to be
                                              undertaken (the client, duty holder or responsible person for the installation)
                                              and anyone subsequently involved in additional or remedial work or additional
                                              inspections to confirm, so far as reasonably practicable, whether or not the
                                              electrical installation is in a satisfactory condition for continued service.
                                              On completion of the inspection, the client, duty holder or responsible person
                                              ordering the work should receive the original report and the inspector should
                                              retain a duplicate copy. The original report should be retained in a safe place and
                                              be made available to any person inspecting or undertaking work on the electrical
                                              installation in the future. If the property is vacated, the report will provide the
                                              new owner or occupier with details of the condition of the electrical installation at
                                              the time the report was issued.

            FAULT DIAGNOSIS PROCEDURES
            Fault diagnosis is one of the highest risk tasks when working on electrical
            installations due to the unknown issues that could be causing the fault. As a result,
            persons undertaking fault diagnosis and location work must consider the following:
            ●    Hazards associated with fault diagnosis and minimising those hazards
            ●    Safe working and logical procedures
            ●    Understanding the types of faults
            ●    Preparation and use of test instruments
            ●    Interpreting results and data.

            Hazards associated with fault diagnosis
            The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR) require those in control of
            part or all of an electrical system to ensure that it is safe to use and that it is
            maintained in a safe condition. The process of identifying and rectifying faults
            will inevitably involve exposure to some hazards and these must be dealt with in
            accordance with the requirements of the EAWR.
            Electrical injuries are the most likely hazard and the following may occur due to
            contact with electricity:
            ●    electric shock
            ●    electrical burns
            ●    loss of muscle control                                                                             INDUSTRY TIP

            The magnitude (size) and duration of the shock current are the two most
            significant factors determining the severity of an electric shock. The magnitude
            of the shock current depends on the contact voltage and impedance (electrical
            resistance) of the shock path. A possible shock path always exists through ground
            contact (e.g. through a hand-to-feet route); in this case the shock path impedance
            is the body impedance plus any external impedance. A more dangerous situation
            is a hand-to-hand shock path, when one hand is in contact with an exposed
            conductive part, such as an earthed metal equipment case, while the other
            simultaneously touches a live part. In this case, the current will be limited only by
            the body impedance.

                                              As the voltage increases, so the body impedance decreases – this increases the
                                              shock current. When the voltage decreases the body impedance increases, which

                                              reduce the risk of electric shock to a low level. If the system energy levels are low,
                                              then arcing is unlikely to cause burns.

                                              Electric burns
                                              Electric burn injury may arise due to:
                                              ●   the passage of shock current through the body, particularly if at high voltage
                                              ●   exposure to high-frequency radiation, e.g. from radio transmission antennas.
                                              An electrical burn may not show on the skin at all or may appear minor, but the
                                              damage can extend deep into the tissues beneath the skin. Medical advice should
                                              always be sought if an electrical burn is sustained.

                                              Loss of muscle control
                                              People who experience an electric shock often get painful muscle spasms that are
                                              strong enough to break bones or dislocate joints. This loss of muscle control may
                                              mean that the person cannot let go to escape the electric shock. Alternatively, the
                                              person may fall if they are working at height or be thrown into nearby machinery
                                              and structures.
                                              Direct current (DC) is particularly high risk as the current locks a person’s muscle,
                                              meaning they cannot let go if they are holding a live conductive part.

              HEALTH AND SAFETY
                                              Fires arising from electrical causes
              For the latest information      In 2016/17 more than 10% of fires in domestic premises had electricity
              relating to fires in            distribution as the factor in their cause. The principal causes of fires arising from
              domestic premises,              electricity are wiring with defects such as insulation failure, the overloading
              research the Home               of switches and isolators or conductors, lack of electrical protection, poor

              of fires attended by fire
              and rescue services.
                                              Arcing and explosion
                                              This frequently occurs due to short-circuit flashover accidentally caused while
                                              working on live equipment (either intentionally or unintentionally). Arcing
                                              generates UV radiation, causing severe sunburn; molten metal particles are also
                                              likely to be ejected onto exposed skin surfaces.
                                              There are two main electrical causes of explosion:
                                              ●   short circuit – due to an equipment fault
                                              ●   ignition of flammable vapours or liquids – caused by sparks or high surface
                                                  temperatures.

                                              Understanding the measures used to minimise the hazards of fault diagnosis is
                                              essential, not just for the safety of the inspector, but also for protecting others
                                              and the electrical equipment.

            Isolation and switching of supply
            The preparation of electrical equipment for fault diagnosis and repair purposes
            often requires effective disconnection from all live supplies and a means for
            securing that disconnection, for example, by locking off with a suitable lock and
            single key. There is an important distinction between switching and isolation.
            Switching is cutting off the supply while isolation is the secure disconnection
            and separation from all sources of electrical energy. A variety of control devices
            is available for switching, isolation or a combination of these functions, some
            incorporating protective devices. Before starting work on a piece of isolated
            equipment, checks should be made, using an approved testing device, to ensure
            that the circuit is dead.
            There are also secondary hazards, detailed below, associated with electrical
            testing that must be considered when risk assessments and a safe work practice
            document are being prepared.

            Minimising hazards of lone working
            Fault diagnosis, which may require some form of live electrical work, is often
            undertaken by people working alone and without close or direct supervision.
            There is no specific requirement contained in the Electricity at Work Regulations
                                                                                                            KEY TERM

            danger and other precautionary measures to be adopted (such as role planning
            and relevant training). If a second person is not present, consideration must be
            given to special procedures for the lone worker, such as:
            ●    making sure that every site visit is recorded in a visitor log book
            ●    keeping in contact with the employer by making regular telephone calls
            ●    signing out when leaving the site for any reason
            ●    making contact with the site owner on returning to site, to confirm that there
                 have been no material changes to the system since the last visit.
            It is likely that an electrician visiting a site for fault rectification purposes will
            be required to undergo some form of induction training which will explain the
            requirement to observe site-specific elements appropriate to their own work and/
            or site-specific activities, such as:
            ●    site hazards and risks, e.g. open excavations, presence of overhead power lines,
                 confined spaces and hazardous areas
            ●    fire risks and site fire procedures
            ●    areas of work that will require specific authorisation to proceed, such as a
                 permit to work
            ●    restricted areas and the reasons for the control measures in place.

            Minimising hazards from static electricity
            Static electricity is produced by the build-up of electrons in weak electrical
            conductors or insulating materials. These materials may be gaseous, liquid or solid
            and may include flammable liquids, powders, plastic films and granules.

                                              A simple example of static electricity is a person walking across a carpeted
                                              floor, who builds up a static charge because of the friction of their shoes on the
                                              carpet. When the person touches an object that is either uncharged or that has
                                              an opposite charge, a short pulse of very high-voltage static charge is released
                                              quickly. This can cause damage to sensitive circuitry in computers, laptops and
                                              communication systems. Anti-static carpet sprays can be used to combat this
                                              problem.
                                              Large static charges may develop on drive belts between motors and machinery,
                                              such as those involving laminate manufacturing processes or large rolls of paper
                                              for toilet tissue or kitchen roll running at high speeds. If not diverted through
                                              proper earthing, the built-up static charges may discharge suddenly and cause
                                              damage to electronic equipment, such as proximity switches and programmable
                                              logic controllers. Earthed anti-static strips, which look similar to tinsel, can be
                                              strategically positioned to continuously discharge these unwanted voltages.

                                              In areas containing explosive materials, great care must be taken to prevent
                                              static discharges, since a spark could set off a violent explosion. The use of
                                              large-diameter pipes for the transfer of liquids reduces the flow rate and, hence,
                                              the build-up of static charge. Airborne fibres, dust or flecks of paper – such as
                                              those produced in industrial processes – should be removed at source and not be
                                              allowed to accumulate as this may create a fire risk if static is likely. The static
                                              effect is increased in environments with low humidity and in buildings with air
                                              conditioning and high levels of heating, such as computer suites, and this should
                                              be considered when undertaking electrical work in such areas.

                                              Minimising hazards from fibre-optic cabling
                                              As more fibre-optic cable systems are introduced into installations, the maintenance
                                              and fault-finding demands increase. Probably the greatest hazard to deal with, for
                                              approved electricians, is fibre-optic cable’s benign appearance. It does not carry
                                              electricity, so there is no electrocution risk; it isn’t a source of heat or combustion so
                                              there is no fire risk; and it is not possible to know when it is operating.

            Energy is transferred along fibre-optic cables as digital pulses of laser light and,
            therefore, direct eye contact with the light should be avoided. However, damage
            to the eye caused by looking into a damaged fibre-optic cable is rare as the
            broken surface of the cable tends to scatter the light coming through it.
            A more serious hazard of optical-fibre work comes from the fibres themselves.
            Fibres are pieces of optical glass which, like any piece or sliver of glass, can cause
            injury. Hazards arise when cables are opened and fibres penetrate the hands or are
            transferred to the respiratory or alimentary system. Therefore, suitable PPE (such
            as gloves and face masks) should be used when working with fibre-optic cabling.
            Fibre-optic cables have a similar appearance to steel wire armour cables (SWA)
            but are much lighter. They should be installed in the same way and given a similar
            level of protection as steel wire armour cables. Fibre-optic terminations should
            always be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
                                                                                                           Figure 7.9 Electricians should

            The use of electronic circuits in all types of electrical equipment is now
            commonplace, with components being found in motor starting equipment,
            control circuits, emergency lighting, discharge lighting, intruder alarms, special-
            effect lighting and dimmer switches, and domestic appliances. Electrical
            installations usually operate at currents in excess of 1 A and up to many hundreds
            of amperes; all electronic components and circuits are low voltage and usually
            operate in mA or μA. Therefore, this fact must be considered when the choice of
            electrical test equipment is made.
            The working voltage of a standard insulation resistance tester (250 V/500 V) may
            cause damage to any of the electronic devices described above, if not rated for
            this voltage. When carrying out insulation resistance tests as part of a prescribed
            test, or after fault repair, all electronic devices must be disconnected. Should
            resistance measurements be required on electronic circuits and components, a
            battery-operated ohmmeter with high impedance must be used.

            Minimising hazards from high-frequency or capacitive
            circuits
            Capacitors that are used in fluorescent fittings and single-phase motors are a
            potential source of electric shock arising from:
            ●    the discharge of electrical energy retained by the capacitor unit(s) after they
                 have been isolated
            ●    inadequate precautions to guard against electric shock as a result of any
                 charged conductors or associated fittings
            ●    charged capacitors that are inadequately short circuited
            ●    equipment retaining or regaining a charge.
            Live working is to be avoided where possible, but any equipment containing a
            capacitor must be assumed to be live or charged until it is proven, beyond any
            doubt, that the circuits are dead and the capacitors are discharged and are unable
            to recharge.

                                              for maintaining supplies where a supply interruption could cause business issues.
                                              There is, however, risk attached to these larger battery systems which, if used
                                              incorrectly, can be dangerous and can cause explosions.
                                              There are two main classes of battery.
                                              ●   Lead–acid batteries are the most common large-capacity rechargeable
                                                  batteries. They are fitted extensively in UPS of computer and communication
                                                  facilities, and process and machinery control systems.
                                              ●   Alkaline rechargeable batteries, such as nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride
             Figure 7.10 Batteries can           and lithium ion, are widely used in small items, such as laptop computers, but
              explode if used incorrectly         large-capacity versions of these cells are now being used in UPS applications.
                                              The two main hazards from batteries are described below.
                                              ●   Chemical: lead–acid batteries are usually filled with electrolytes, such as
                                                  sulphuric acid or potassium hydroxide. These very corrosive chemicals can
                                                  permanently damage the eyes and produce serious chemical burns to the skin.
                                                  If acid gets into the eyes, they should be flushed immediately with water for
                                                  15 minutes, and prompt medical attention should be sought. If acid gets on
                                                  the skin, the affected area should immediately be rinsed with large amounts
                                                  of water and prompt medical attention should be sought if the chemical burn
                                                  appears serious. Emergency wash stations should be located near lead–acid
                                                  battery storage and charging areas. Under severe overcharge conditions,
                                                  hydrogen gas may be vented from lead–acid batteries and this may form
                                                  an explosive mixture with air if the concentration exceeds 3.8% by volume.
                                                  Adequate ventilation and correct charging arrangements should always be
                                                  observed.
                                              ●   Electrical: batteries contain a lot of stored energy. Under certain circumstances,
                                                  this energy may be released very quickly and unexpectedly. This can happen
                                                  when the terminals are short circuited, e.g. with an uninsulated metal spanner
                                                  or screwdriver. When this happens, a large amount of electricity flows through
                                                  the metal object, making it very hot, very quickly. If the battery explodes, the
                                                  resulting shower of molten metal and plastic can cause serious burns and can
                                                  ignite any explosive gases present around the battery. The short circuit may
                                                  also produce ultraviolet (UV) light which can damage the eyes.

            Most batteries produce quite low voltages, and so there is little risk of direct
            electric shock. However, as some large battery combinations produce more than

            Minimising hazards from information and technology
            (IT) equipment
            All modern offices contain computers that are operated as standalone units or
            networked (linked together). Most computer systems are sensitive to variations
            in the mains supply, which can be caused by external mains switching operations,
            faults on adjacent electricity distribution network circuits, which cause a voltage
            rise, and industrial processes such as induction furnaces and electric arc welding.
            These system disturbances are often well within the electricity supply companies’
            statutory voltage limits but may be sufficient to cause computers to crash.
            To avoid the effects of this system ‘noise’, computer networks are normally
            provided with a clean supply, including a ‘clean earth’. This is obtained by taking
            the supply to the computer network from a point as close as possible to the
            supply intake position of the building. The fitting of noise suppressors or noise
            filters provides additional protection to the computer system. If a production
            process disruption or data loss is a serious business risk, an uninterruptable power
            supply (UPS) is a sensible solution.

                                              A UPS provides emergency power by supplying power from a separate source
                                              (normally batteries) when the supply from the local supply company is
                                              unavailable. It differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby
                                              generator, as these do not provide instant protection from a temporary power
                                              interruption. A UPS can be used to provide uninterrupted power to equipment,
                                              typically for 5 to 15 minutes, until an auxiliary power supply can be turned
                                              on, mains power restored, or equipment safely shut down. UPS units come in
                                              sizes ranging from units that will back up a single computer without monitor
                                              (around 200 W) to units that will power entire data centres or buildings (several
                                              megawatts (MW)).

                                                                                                          wood or paper.
            must carry the appropriate markings if the integrity of the wiring system is to be
            maintained. A luminaire to IP 65 (this International Protection code means the
            fitting is dust-tight and water-jet protected) is an example of equipment used in
            hazardous areas.
            When any work is to be undertaken on electrical equipment in a hazardous area,
            the following procedures must be observed:
            ●    a written safe work procedure (PTW system) that includes control of activities
                 which may cause sparks, hot surfaces or naked flames, should be in place
            ●    control of the working area with signs and barriers
            ●    use of appropriate PPE
            ●    only authorised and competent people to be engaged in the work activity
            ●    only approved tools and equipment to be used
            ●    prohibition of smoking, use of matches and lighters.

                                              If work is to be undertaken in a hazardous area, the hazards and the requirements
                                              to be observed will normally be explained during the site induction process.

                                              Safe working and logical procedures
                                              The possibility of touching live parts is increased during fault finding and repair,
                                              when conductors at dangerous voltages are often exposed. This risk can be
                                              reduced if work is done while the equipment is isolated from any dangerous
                                              source of electrical supply. However, this may not always be possible and, if this is
                                              the case, procedures should be followed to prevent danger.

                                              Planning and agreeing procedures
                                              Before fault rectification is carried out, the safe working arrangements must be
                                              discussed and agreed with the client and/or the duty holder (or responsible person
                                              for the installation) in a clear, concise and courteous manner. The procedure must
                                              be a planned activity as it will almost certainly affect people who work or live in
                                              the premises where the installation is being tested. This ensures that everyone
                                              who is concerned with the work understands what actions need to be taken, such
                                              as:
                                              ●   which areas of the installation may be subject to disconnection
                                              ●   anticipated disruption times
                                              ●   who might be affected by the work
                                              ●   health and safety requirements for the site
                                              ●   which area will have restricted access
                                              ●   whether temporary supplies will be required while the fault repair is underway
                                              ●   the agreement reached on who has authority for the repair.
                                              It may be that a specific person has responsibility for the safe isolation of a
                                              particular section of an installation, in which case that person should be identified
                                              and the isolation arrangements agreed.


                                                  VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS
                                                  Entering into dialogue with the client, before work commences, will minimise
                                                  the potential for unforeseen events and foster good customer relations.


                                              For example, in an office block where the electrical installation is complex and
                                              provides supplies to many different tenants located on a number of floors, the
                                              safe isolation of a sub-circuit for testing purposes may require a larger portion of
                                              the installation to be turned off initially. To achieve this with minimal disruption,
                                              an agreement must be reached between the competent person tasked to carry
                                              out the work and the person responsible for the installations affected. This
                                              responsible person may be the office manager, the designated electrical engineer
                                              for the site or, in some cases, the landlord of the building.

                Everyone involved in the work (e.g. client, electrician and those in the
                workplace) has a responsibility for their own health and safety and that of
                others who may be affected by the work. Communication between all parties
                will ensure compliance with the respective health and safety requirements.


            A logical approach for locating electrical faults
            Locating faults that occur on an electrical system requires a logical approach. This
            approach includes:
            ●    identifying the symptoms
            ●    collecting and analysing data
            ●    using information, such as drawings, certificates, instructions
            ●    checking maintenance records
            ●    using experience
            ●    inspecting, checking and testing.

                                              Information
                                              In order to follow the logical approach to safe working as detailed above, the
                                              approved electrician must have:
                                              ●   an approved safe working procedure or method statement, including a risk
                                                  assessment
                                              ●   a thorough knowledge and understanding of the electrical installation and
                                                  electrical equipment (including access to site-specific circuit diagrams and
                                                  drawings, manufacturers’ information and operating instructions, design
                                                  data, copies of previous Schedules of Inspection or certificates, installation
                                                  specification and maintenance records)
                                              ●   information relating to the fault, including any available knowledge of events
                                                  leading up to the fault (such as unusual smells or observations); this can be
                                                  obtained from users, the duty holder or the responsible person
                                              ●   details of personnel relevant to the operation of the installation. If a fault has
                                                  occurred, it is likely that users of the system will have reported a loss of supply
                                                  or changes in the way the system operates; they will probably be able to
                                                  identify the areas affected. Determining which protective device has operated
                                                  (main circuit breaker, individual circuit breaker or residual current device) will
                                                  narrow the search area and a flow diagram can often assist in this process.
                                              Questions to ask users include the following.
                                              ●   Which parts of the system are without supply – the whole installation or a
                                                  particular item of equipment?
                                              ●   Is the failure a permanent problem or does it only happen at certain times or
                                                  on certain days?
                                              ●   What are the events that led up to the fault occurring?

                                              Visual inspection
                                              A visual inspection is a quick way of identifying defects, damage or deterioration
                                              of the electrical installation. Although this check is commonly called a visual
                                              inspection, other senses such as smell, touch and hearing are also used. Touch can
                                              be used to test conductors to see if they are loose at joints and connections, and
                                              smell can be used to identify overheating of thermoplastic material caused by a
                                              high resistance fault. Hearing can be used to detect arcing at a loose termination.
                                              When conducting a visual inspection, you should consider:
                                              ●   joints and connections – are conductors loose or is a connection missing?
                                              ●   conductors – do they show signs of overheating?
                                              ●   flexible cables and cords – are there signs of exposed insulation or conductors?
                                              ●   switching devices – any signs of overheating?
                                              ●   protective devices – have they operated?
                                              ●   enclosures and mechanical protection – any signs of overheating or physical
                                                  damage?

            Check the supply voltage
            When checking the supply voltage, you should consider:
            ●    is the complete system, together with all circuits, dead?
                                                                                                                   INDUSTRY TIP
            ●    is a particular section of the installation dead?
            ●    has an individual piece of equipment failed?                                               When you dismantle
            Use an approved voltage tester to check for a supply voltage. If there is no                    equipment make sure you
            incoming supply from the distribution network operator (DNO), this may be due                   label, if necessary, all parts
            to a main fuse failure, circuit breaker operation or a fault on the DNO network. It             and store them securely.
            will be necessary to contact the distribution company to effect a repair.




             Figure 7.15 Checking the supply voltage

            Check the protective devices
            When checking the protective devices, you should consider:
            ●    has the main circuit breaker tripped?
            ●    is the system overloaded; have unauthorised items of equipment been
                 connected to the system?
            ●    is the wiring in the distribution board damaged in some way, or is there a short
                 circuit somewhere in the system between live and neutral conductors?

            Common causes of electrical faults
            Knowing some of the common causes of faults will enable a person undertaking
            fault diagnosis work to work more efficiently and logically.
            Many faults are caused through:
            ●    poor system design
            ●    incorrect implementation of the designer’s specification
            ●    a poor standard of installation workmanship
            ●    poor maintenance or neglect of equipment or installation
            ●    misuse, abuse or deliberate ill-treatment of equipment.

            Poor system design
            The proper specification and design of electrical systems and equipment is
            fundamental to the safe operation of installations. The designer of a low-
            voltage system will need a good working knowledge of BS 7671 The IET Wiring
            Regulations, associated IET Guidance Notes and codes of practice, technical
            and equipment standards. They should also understand the duties imposed by

                                              In addition, designers will want the best in terms of equipment but sometimes
                                              budgets mean cheaper equipment is used, leading to decreased reliability.

                                              Failure to implement the designer’s specification correctly
                                              However good the design of a system, it has to be installed correctly to function
                                              as intended. Those concerned with installing the system must be competent
                                              to ensure that the designer’s specification is correctly implemented and all
                                              workmanship is to a high standard.

                                              Poor standard of installation workmanship
                                              Typical areas of poor installation practice are:
                                              ●   poor termination of conductors, which creates overheating due to poor
                                                  electrical contact
                                              ●   loose bushings and couplings, which may lead to poor earth continuity and risk
                                                  of shock
                                              ●   use of incorrectly sized conductors, leading to overheating
                                              ●   cable damage that occurs when drawing in cables
                                              ●   heavily populated trunking or conduit, leading to overheating
                                              ●   incorrect connections at components, which may lead to crossed polarity (so
                                                  that a circuit remains live although the protective device has operated).
                                              Those concerned with installation work need to know not only how to do a job,
                                              but why it is important to do it in the specified way.

                                              Misuse of equipment
                                              EAW Regulation 4(3) requires that: ‘every work activity, including operation, use
                                              and maintenance of a system and work near a system, shall be carried out in such
                                              a manner as not to give rise, so far as is reasonably practicable, to danger and
                                              users (the duty holder) have a responsibility to use equipment in the manner for
                                              which it was intended’. Deliberate or unintentional misuse, such as overloading
                                              a radial circuit supplying socket outlets with too many electric heaters, could be
                                              seen as misuse.
                                              Abuse or deliberate ill-treatment of equipment, such as removal of barriers or
                                              covers, may result in a short circuit because of contact between live conductors.

                                              Understanding common faults
                                              An electrical fault can reveal itself in a number of ways or in a combination of
                                              those ways, for example:
                                              ●   complete loss of power throughout the whole installation
                                              ●   partial or localised loss of power
                                              ●   failure of an individual component.

                                              Failure of an individual component
                                              Faults in components such as switches, contactors, time switches and photo
                                              electric cells may result in particular circuits not operating as was intended. For
                                              example, heaters that are programmed to operate via a time switch can only be
                                              turned off by operation of the protective device.

            Total failure of a piece of equipment
            An example might be the failure of a heating element in a fire or shower, resulting
            in an earth fault or short circuit.

            Insulation failure
            An insulation fault can allow current leakage. As insulation ages, its insulating
            properties and performance deteriorates; this is accelerated in harsh
            environments, such as those with temperature extremes and/or chemical
            contamination. This deterioration can result in dangerous conditions for people
            and poor reliability in installations. It is important to recognise this deterioration
            so that corrective steps can be taken.

            Excess current
            If excess current is drawn by a circuit, protective devices will operate frequently.
            This could be caused by too many items of equipment being connected at the
            same time.

            Short circuits
            These occur when two or more components, which would normally be separated
            by insulation or barriers, come into contact with each other. For example, in an
            overload condition the circuit conductors are carrying more current than the
            manufacturer’s design specification allows and, if this is allowed to continue
            indefinitely, the conductors will become very hot, causing deterioration of the
            electrical insulation surrounding the live conductors. This may eventually lead
            to breakdown of the insulation and a short circuit. In this overload situation, it is
            likely that the protective device, if specified correctly, will operate before a short-
            circuit condition is reached. Continual operation of a protective device should be
            investigated immediately, by isolating the circuit or carrying out an insulation
            resistance test, or by using a clamp meter or clip-on meter to check load readings.

            Open circuits
            An open circuit generally occurs when there is a break in the circuit. This could
            be the result of a broken conductor, a loose connection caused by excessive
            mechanical stress or a component that has failed due to age, damage,
            overloading, suitability for continued use and overheating.

            Transient overvoltage
            This is caused by heavy current switching and distribution network operator
            (DNO) system faults. Occasionally, large internal loads may cause such transient
            overvoltages.
            The designer of a system must ensure that all system components are selected
            according to their intended use and are appropriately rated. Two main factors
            must be considered:




                                                                                                                                             435

              at the CENELEC website,         However, design work does not cater for abnormal transient voltages caused by

                                              drops, lightning strikes on overhead line conductors, electronic equipment and
                                              earth fault voltages. In some installations, such as IT networks, where transient
                                              voltages can cause problems, additional measures are included. Filters added to IT
                                              networks can suppress transient voltages and provide stabilised voltage levels.

                                              High-resistance faults
                                              These faults usually occur in a circuit where a cable or conductor is poorly joined
                                              in an accessory, such as a socket outlet, switch, light fitting, or junction box. The
                                              most common cause is simply a loose screw terminal connection, because the
                                              connection was not made sufficiently well in the first place, debris is present
                                              in the connection (e.g. pieces of stripped insulation), or it might be that the
                                              connection has become loose over time. Connections can work loose through
                                              the normal thermal cycling of a circuit. If a circuit routinely carries a significant
                                              proportion of its maximum design current, the cable will be subject to repeated
                                              heating and cooling cycles. This can result in expansion and contraction, which
                                              can loosen the terminal screws. Vibration can also affect joints and connections,
                                              and that is why connections for generators need to be crimped or brazed.

                                              Where common faults are found
                                              The following list is not exhaustive but it highlights the major areas where faults
                                              may occur.

                                              Wiring systems
                                              Wiring faults do occur in low-voltage systems but cable damage is not a
                                              common occurrence if the installation has been constructed in accordance with
                                              Chapter 52 of BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations. However, if the installation
                                              has not been constructed to a high standard, damage may occur and a latent
                                              fault may exist, causing a failure at a later date. PVC-insulated and sheathed
                                              wiring is extensively used for wiring in domestic and light industrial installations,
                                              and the very act of installing cable runs can result in mechanical damage to
                                              the cable due to impact, abrasion, compression or penetration (which must be
                                              minimised at all times).
                                              Where cables have to be turned or bent, the radius should be such that it does
                                              not damage the conductors. Where cables are installed in walls behind plaster
                                              or in a stud wall, mechanical protection is only required if the depth of the
                                              cable is less than 50 mm, or if they are not placed within accepted zones that
                                              are 150 mm wide around wall edges and ceiling–wall joints, or if the cables are

            not run horizontally or vertically to an accessory point. If it is not possible to
            provide such protection and the installation is used by people with no technical
            background, additional protection must be provided by the installation of a
            residual current device.
            When designers calculate the conductor sizes for installations, based on load
            factors, they also specify how the cables should be installed. Any deviation
            from the specification could have an adverse effect – cable current-carrying
            capacities will be reduced by such factors as grouping, surrounding the cables
            with thermal insulation and siting the cables in a hot environment that will cause
            overheating. Bear in mind that this could take place after the installation was
            originally commissioned. Poor installation practice could also result in cables being
            subjected to compression, pinching or abrasive damage.

                                              When a fault occurs elsewhere on an associated part of an electrical system, a
                                              poor joint or termination may constitute a hazard by limiting the flow of fault
                                              current, thereby causing delayed operation of the circuit protective device. In
                                              an extreme case, the passage of high fault current may cause the defective
                                              joint to burn into an open-circuit fault before the circuit protective device has
                                              time to operate, with the result that the original fault remains uncleared. This
                                              is particularly hazardous in the case of an earth fault, since exposed conductive
                                              parts may become and remain live at the system voltage, giving an increased risk
                                              of electric shock.

                                              Equipment and accessories
                                              Faults can also occur in equipment and accessories, such as switches, sockets,
                                              control equipment, motor contactors and electric appliances or at the point of
                                              connection with electronic equipment. Contacts that make and break a circuit
                                              are a potential source of failure, depending on the amount of operation they are
                                              subjected to. Socket outlets and isolating switches that control fans in kitchens
                                              or bathrooms, or showers in bathrooms, that are subjected to regular use with
                                              capacity loads may fail due to overheating and loose connections.
                                              Failure of an individual component, such as an electric shower or immersion
                                              heater element, may lead to an open-circuit fault. Photoelectric cells and time
                                              switches may fail in the ‘closed position’ and then do not operate as intended.
                                              Faulty RCDs may cause nuisance tripping. The correct operation of a suspected
                                              faulty RCD would need to be determined by the use of an approved RCD tester.
                                              Modern RCD testers include a facility called a ramp test. The ramp test slowly
                                              increases the tripping current until the RCD trips. The display is in mA and will
                                              identify if an RCD is susceptible to nuisance tripping or is out of specification. It
                                              can also be used to indicate which circuits have high leakage currents and can be
                                              used when there is evidence of frequent trips on a particular RCD.
                                              Under certain circumstances these tests can result in potentially dangerous
                                              voltages appearing on exposed and extraneous conductive parts within the
                                              installation. Therefore, suitable precautions must be taken to prevent contact
                                              by persons or livestock with any such part. Other users of the building should
                                              be made aware of the tests being carried out and warning notices should be
                                              posted as necessary. Cables that are terminated at an accessory contained in, or
                                              passing through, a metal box should be bushed with a rubber grommet to prevent
                                              abrasion of the cable.

                                              Instrument and metering panels
                                              Faults can occur in instrument and metering panels as a result of a faulty
                                              component, such as a burnt-out current transformer (CT) or voltage transformer
                                              (VT), or as a result of faulty test probes being applied to the instrument.

                                              Protective devices
                                              These may be subject to loose connections. If an incorrect device was selected
                                              for the circuit and does not offer the correct protection or selectivity, a fault may
                                              result.

            Light fittings often fault because the lamp has expired. Fluorescent fittings
            (discharge lighting) grow dimmer with age and may even begin to flicker or to
            flash on and off. These are warning signals and the necessary repairs should be
            made as soon as there is any change in the lamp’s normal performance. A dim
            tube usually requires replacement, and failure to replace it can strain other parts
            of the fixture. Likewise, repeated flickering or flashing will wear out the starter,
            causing the insulation at the starter to deteriorate.

            and signalling cable used for information and technology (IT) systems or WiFi.
            If your WiFi router is located in a position adjacent to equipment that regularly
            switches, such as a fridge, the arcing caused by the switch creates EMI, which can
            cause WiFi to drop. Similarly, data or signal cables installed in close proximity
            to power cables are liable to signal faults brought about by the magnetic field
            induced around cables. See Chapter 3 of this book, in particular, page 199 for the
            section relating to Chapter 44 of BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations.

            Using instruments safely
            When using test instruments to carry out fault diagnosis, follow these basic
            precautions to achieve safe working.
            ●    Understanding the equipment: make sure you are familiar with the instrument
                 to be used and its ranges; check its suitability for the characteristics of the
                 installation it will be used on.
            ●    Self-test: many organisations regularly test instruments on known values to
                 ensure they remain accurate. These tests would be documented.
            ●    Calibration: all electrical test instruments should be calibrated on a regular
                 basis. The time between calibrations will depend on the amount of usage that
                 the instrument receives, although this should not exceed 12 months under any
                 circumstances. Instruments have to be calibrated under laboratory conditions,
                 against standards that can be traced back to national standards; therefore,
                 this usually means returning the instrument to a specialist laboratory. Once
                 calibrated, the instrument will have a calibration label attached to it, stating
                 the date the calibration took place and the date the next calibration is due. It
                 will also be issued with a calibration certificate, detailing the tests that have
                 been carried out, and a reference to the equipment used. Instruments that are
                 subject to any electrical or mechanical misuse (e.g. if the instrument undergoes
                 an electrical short circuit or is dropped) should be returned for recalibration
                 before being used again.
                                                                                                                                           439

                                                 Electrical test instruments are relatively delicate and expensive items of
                                                 equipment. They should:
                                                 ●   be handled with care
                                                 ●   when not in use, be stored in clean, dry conditions at normal room temperature.
                                                 Furthermore:
                                                 ●   Check test leads: make sure that these and any associated probes or clips
                                                     are in good order, are clean and have no cracked or broken insulation. Where
                                                     appropriate, the requirements of the HSE Guidance Note GS38 should be
                                                     observed for test leads.
                                                 ●   Select appropriate scales and settings: it is essential that the correct scale and
                                                     settings are selected for an instrument. Manufacturers’ instructions must be
                                                     observed under all circumstances.

                                                 FAULT RECTIFICATION
                                                 Electrical faults do not occur at convenient times, and fault diagnosis and repair
                                                 are often undertaken in difficult circumstances. For the duty holder or person
                                                 responsible for the electrical installation, it can be difficult to determine the most
                                                 suitable arrangements for fault rectification, due to the potential for danger to
                                                 people and equipment, time delay and lost production.
                                                 The consequences of a fault on an electrical installation can be considerable: lost
                                                 production due to the unavailability of a machine, lost business where goods,
                                                 products or services are not being made available to a customer and data loss

            if, for example, the back-up UPS fails to function. Therefore, a suitable process
            needs to be established in order to keep inconvenience and costs to an acceptable
            level, without compromising the safety of users of the system and electricians
            undertaking the fault repair.

            The process of fault rectification
            Having identified the fault, the most suitable rectification process should
            be identified. This could be as simple as correcting a loose connection at an
            accessory terminal or undertaking a repair by replacing a faulty conductor.

            Agreeing the process of fault rectification
            Often the solution will be fairly straightforward but, in some circumstances,
            options must be discussed and agreed with the duty holder or responsible person.
            Some or all of the following issues may be open to consideration.
            ●    What is the cost of replacement?
            ●    What is the availability of suitably trained staff?
            ●    Is it possible to replace a lesser number of components?
            ●    What is the cost comparison of replacing or repairing a component?
            ●    What is the potential disruption to the manufacturing process or computer
                 availability?
            ●    What is the availability of replacement parts, if required?
            ●    Can other parts of the system be energised while the repair is carried out?
            ●    What is availability of emergency or standby supplies?
            ●    What is the anticipated ‘down time’ while a repair is carried out?
            ●    Is there a requirement for a continuous supply?
            ●    Will out-of-hours working be required?
            ●    Are there any legal or personnel issues to be considered (warranties, contracts)?
            Once the decision on how the fault rectification is to proceed has been made and
            agreed with the duty holder or responsible person, a work activity plan should be

                                              prepared. This, once again, must be agreed with the duty holder. The plan should
                                              include a safe system of work and requirements for circuit outages.
                                              Unless the fault diagnosis and rectification are being undertaken by an in-house
                                              electrician, site access must be granted by the duty holder or responsible person.
                                              This could involve a site induction, with site access passes being issued. There
                                              might also be a logging-in procedure (visitors’ book) required for each visit.
                                              The preceding arrangements are all concerned with a fault or supply failure on
                                              the client’s system. However, the initial fault diagnosis may determine that the
                                              problem is connected with the system of the distribution network operator
                                              (DNO). If this is the case, the responsibility for the fault rectification rests with
                                              the network operator. Under these circumstances, it is good business practice
                                              to advise the client on how to deal with the DNO, requesting the provision of
                                              temporary standby supplies in the form of a back-up generator if required.
                                              The work activity should be managed with appropriate technical support and
                                              resource allocations to ensure that an effective repair is completed within the
                                              agreed timescales.

                                              Planning and agreeing procedures
                                              Before fault diagnosis is carried out, the safe working arrangements must be
                                              discussed and agreed with the client and/or the duty holder (or responsible person
                                              for the installation) in a clear, concise and courteous manner. The testing and
                                              inspection procedure must be a planned activity as it will almost certainly affect
                                              people who work or live in the premises where the installation is being tested. This
                                              ensures that everyone who is concerned with the work understands what actions
                                              need to be taken, such as:
                                              ●   which areas of the installation may be subject to disconnection
                                              ●   anticipated disruption times
                                              ●   who might be affected by the work
                                              ●   health and safety requirements for the site
                                              ●   which area will have restricted access
                                              ●   whether temporary supplies will be required while the fault diagnosis is
                                                  underway
                                              ●   the agreement reached on who has authority for the diagnosis and repair.
                                              It may be that a specific person has responsibility for the safe isolation of a
                                              particular section of an installation and that person should be identified and the
                                              isolation arrangements agreed. By entering into dialogue with the client before
                                              work commences, the potential for unforeseen events will be minimised and good
                                              customer relations will be fostered.
                                              For example, in an office block where the electrical installation is complex and
                                              provides supplies to many different tenants located on a number of floors, the
                                              safe isolation of a sub-circuit for testing purposes may require a larger portion
                                              of the installation to be turned off initially. In order to achieve this with minimal
                                              disruption, an agreement must be reached between the competent person tasked
                                              to carry out the work and the person responsible for the installations affected.

            This responsible person could be the office manager, the designated electrical
            engineer for the site or, in some cases, the landlord of the building.
            Everyone involved in the work (e.g. client, electrician and those in the workplace)
            has a responsibility for their own health and safety and that of others who may be
            affected by the work. Communication between all parties will ensure compliance
            with the respective health and safety requirements.

            Restoring the building fabric
            There may be a requirement to disturb the fabric or structure of the building
            and, if this is the case, it is very important for all aspects of the rectification
            to be discussed with the client. Agreement must be obtained for the work to
            be undertaken, for the extent of the repair necessary (to brick, block, plaster,
            concrete, screed, plasterboard and decorations, for example) and for the
            contractual arrangements (who is paying for the repair). The fabric and structure
            of the building must always be left in a condition that does not compromise either
            fire safety or the building’s structural performance.
            Minor cosmetic repair works, such as patch plastering, disturbance to stud walls or
            decoration, are often within the capability of an experienced electrical technician,
            but you must always recognise your own limitations. Expert advice, such as
            from a specialist contractor, should be sought if any structural modifications are
            required.

                                              The regulations require any ‘producer’ of such equipment, that is a manufacturer,
                                              rebrander or importer of electrical and electronic equipment, to finance the costs
                                              of collection and treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment that
                                              arises over a calendar year, in proportion to the amount by weight placed on the
                                              market. Producers meet their obligations by registering with an approved producer
                                              compliance scheme. Through this scheme, producers fund reuse, recovery and
                                              recycling of electrical goods at an approved authorised treatment facility (AATF)
                                              or approved exporter (AE).
                                              In 2009 there were several amendments made to the UK WEEE Regulations that
                                              mainly affect producer compliance schemes, approved authorised treatment
                                              facilities and approved exporters. The UK has also implemented an EU Directive
                                              (The Waste Framework Directive), which is the primary European legislation for
                                              the management of waste, through a series of regulations dealing with waste. The
                                              directive has been revised and these revisions have been implemented in England
                                              and Wales through the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 and ancillary
                                              legislation in Wales.
                                              The on-site disposal of waste materials following electrical installation work will
                                              be dealt with in a number of ways.
                                              ●   The packaging material from the electrical fittings and accessories (mainly
                                                  cardboard) is normally stored and arrangements made for collection, transport
                                                  and recycling.
                                              ●   Small amounts of non-recyclable material can be disposed of in the electrical
                                                  contractor’s skip or in the client’s skip, if agreement has been reached for this
                                                  to take place.
                                              ●   Off-cuts of cable, conduit, trunking, cable tray and general ferrous and non-
                                                  ferrous materials are often collected for disposal at a metal recycling plant.
                                              ●   Useable off-cuts of cable, conduit, trunking and cable tray should be returned
                                                  to stock for future use.

                                              Asbestos
                                              The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2012 affects anyone who owns,
                                              occupies, manages or otherwise has responsibilities for the maintenance and repair
                                              of buildings that may contain asbestos. Asbestos materials may be encountered by
                                              electricians during the course of their work. Asbestos materials in good condition
                                              are usually safe. However, if asbestos fibres become airborne they are very
              HEALTH AND SAFETY               dangerous. This may happen when materials are damaged, due to demolition or

              by specialist contractors.
                                              If asbestos is discovered during electrical installation or remedial work, work must
                                              be stopped immediately. Specialist contractors must be engaged to ascertain the
                                              condition of the asbestos and to determine any actions necessary for its removal,

            are classified as hazardous waste in England and Wales and as special waste in
            Scotland. Preferably, they should be recycled or, if absolutely necessary, taken to
            specialist disposal sites. They must not be disposed of as general waste.

            Leaving the installation safe
            Once repairs have been completed, initial verification of the repairs may
            be required unless the replacement was a like-for-like accessory or item of
            equipment.
            Any replacement of cable or modification of a circuit requires initial verification as
            detailed in Chapter 6.
            Depending on the nature of repair, one of the following may be used to certificate
            the repair as safe:
            ●    Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC)
            ●    Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate (MEIWC).

            Electrical Installation Certificate
            This would be used where the repairs were major or involved the rewire of a
            circuit or replacement of a distribution board. Only the circuit in question would
            be tested and the existing installation where no work was undertaken would not
            be included as part of the scope of the certificate.

            Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate
            This would be used to certificate a repair or modification to an existing circuit
            which does not include the rewiring of the complete circuit.
            Although a MEIWC is not required for a like-for-like replacement, such as the
            replacement of a damaged light switch, it is recommended that one is completed
            as this adds to the history of the installation and is good evidence when judging
            the history of an installation for a pattern of defects.

            Practice synoptic assessment
            Part of your qualification is a synoptic assessment, to test your skills as a whole.
            These assessments are based on a particular electrical installation and an
            ‘assignment brief’ that generally outlines the assignment scenario.
            The synoptic is normally broken down into four tasks as follows.
            1    Design and plan the installation
            2    Initial verification of the installation
            3    Fault diagnosis and rectification
            4    Self-evaluation.
            Below is an example of what you can expect to see for a synoptic assignment,
            along with some tips about completing the non-practical tasks.


            ASSIGNMENT BRIEF
            You have been asked by your employer to design sections of the electrical
            installation for a new product repair and test facility within a new self-contained
            building on a large site. The floor plan for this new building is shown in the
            drawing.
            When putting together a design for the installation, you have also been asked
            to consider a plan for the resource (labour and material) requirements. Your
            employer has provided you with the initial high-level requirements in the table
            below which you will need to present in a labour resource bar chart and a
            materials take-off sheet.
            There are also a number of existing buildings on site, and as part of the contract
            you are required to carry out inspection and testing of the electrical installations
            installed within these buildings. In addition to this, the client has reported several
            faults which need to be diagnosed and rectified.
            Once you have completed the inspection, verification and fault rectification, you
            will need to complete a self-evaluation reflecting on the work you have carried
            out. You will need to consider what went well and what you would do differently
            if you were to carry out a job like this again in the future.

                                           HOW TO APPROACH THE
                                           SYNOPTIC ASSESSMENT
                                           Make sure you study the drawings and work schedule carefully and take in all
                                           information. Anything not mentioned may be assumed. It is always a good idea to
                                           list these assumptions as you go.
                                           As the drawing in this book is not scaled, and the lengths of two of the circuits are
                                           required, we will take those as being:
                                           ●   circuit 2 – 3 m
                                           ●   circuit 5 – 22 m
                                           In your synoptic assessment, always use the scale on the drawing and a rule and
                                           estimate your circuit lengths using given heights. You will probably not be exact,
                                           and you do not need to be. You are allowed up to 5 metres or so of tolerance
                                           either way where the wiring route is obvious. Where routes are not obvious,
                                           consider the shortest distance the wiring could take within the wiring systems.
                                           Also consider that for lighting circuits, wiring will go to switches but do not
                                           include switch line return wiring as voltage drop calculations already take into
                                           consideration the line and neutral of a circuit and the return from a switch is the
                                           same as a neutral.
                                           The design part of a synoptic is about demonstrating understanding and this can
                                           be done by justifying everything you do. Where calculations are needed, show
                                           them in your work and why you have come to the conclusion that a result of a
                                           given calculation is right.
                                           Try to remember that the work you produce will be marked and/or moderated by
                                           someone who has never met you, so you need to show what you know through
                                           your response to the assignment.

            Appendix 1: Introduction
            to the electrotechnical
            qualifications
            You are completing one of the following qualifications:
            ●    Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation (2365-03)
            ●    Level 3 Technical Certificate in Electrical Installation (8202-30)
            ●    T Level Technical Qualification in Building Services Engineering for
                 Construction (8710)
            ●    Level 3 Electrotechnical Qualification (installation or maintenance) (5357-03).
            These qualifications aim to equip you with the practical skills and technical
            knowledge necessary to help you gain employment within the industry, or
            progress your training within the current apprenticeship route.
            Alternatively, you may be completing the Level 3 Technical Certificate (8202-30)
            as a means of progressing to further education at Level 4 and above.
            Whatever route you wish to take, these qualifications fully integrate with each
            other, allowing seamless progression.


            HOW TO BECOME AN
            ELECTRICIAN
            To become a fully recognised electrician, you must complete the following:
            ●    5357-03 knowledge units
            ●    5357-03 on-site performance units
            ●    Achievement Measurement Test 2 (AM2) synoptic end test.                                 INDUSTRY TIP
            In addition, on completion of the above, you may also gain EngTech recognition         For more information on
            from the Engineering Council through a fast-track process, as the on-site              EngTech, please visit the IET’s
            performances measure the behaviours the Engineering Council requires for               website.
            this recognition. That means you can use the EngTech initials after your name,
            showing professional recognition.
            If you are not currently enrolled on the Electrotechnical Qualification (5357-03),
            do not worry. You can transfer your skills gained through the Diploma or Technical
            Certificate towards the 5357 knowledge units, meaning you will not need to
            complete all of the assessments.
            The easiest way to explain your progression route is to show each qualification
            side by side.

            As well as classroom- and workshop-based learning, 8710-353 (Electrical
            Engineering) or 8710-352 (Electrical and Electronic Equipment) provide, within the
            course, nine weeks of work experience with an employer.
            The courses share a core unit that looks at the common elements across building
            services and this serves as a great insight into other occupational specialisms,
            including the science behind them. So, as well as learning about the electrical
            industry, students will also learn much about the other building services such as
            air-conditioning systems, heating, etc.
            In addition, the course covers the specific specialism content which is covered in
            this book.
            At the time of writing, it is anticipated that the T Levels will integrate into the
            5357 apprenticeship in the same way as 8202 and 2365.
            The diagram above shows the progression route with T Levels.

            8202-20/30
            Level 2 is assessed using one on-screen multiple-choice examination and one
            practical synoptic assignment.
            For the synoptic assignment, a typical brief might be to install a cable and wiring
            system. You will need to draw on skills and understanding developed across
            the qualification content in order to consider the specific requirements of the
            particular wiring system and the related electrical principles, and carry out the
            brief. This includes the ability to plan tasks, such as marking out and cutting
            cables, and apply the appropriate practical and hand skills to carry them out using
            appropriate tools and equipment.
            You will also demonstrate that you are following health and safety regulations at
            all times by drawing upon your knowledge of legislation and regulations.
            The exam draws from learning across the entire content of the qualification, using
            multiple-choice questions to:
            ●    confirm breadth of knowledge and understanding
            ●    test applied knowledge and understanding – giving candidates the opportunity
                 to demonstrate higher-level integrated understanding through application,
                 analysis and evaluation.
            At Level 3, you are expected to complete a written examination, marked by external
            examiners, which covers the knowledge requirements across all of all units.
            You will also need to complete a synoptic assignment that covers the following
            subject areas:
            ●    electrical design
            ●    inspection, testing and commissioning
            ●    fault diagnosis and rectification.

            particular job or a business might lose an opportunity to a competitor who has
            developed a strength in that area.
            Opportunities are the openings or changes in the external environment that can
            bring about new challenges or horizons. An example could be a newly qualified
            20-year-old electrician who has shown an interest in inspection and testing.
            This type of work is normally given to more experienced workers but, due to
            an unusual level of sickness in the company, this electrician is asked to carry
            out inspection and testing on a number of industrial projects. The company say
            that, subject to the work being completed to a satisfactory standard, any future
            work of this type will be given to this individual. When a permanent testing job
            becomes available, the individual will have the required experience.
            In a business context, threats usually come from competition or changes in the
            market. They can come from anywhere and are usually more devastating when
            they come from an unanticipated source. Therefore, when ‘horizon scanning’
            for opportunities, it is necessary to check if there are also any threats, such as a
            competitor moving into a new area of business that overlaps yours. Every threat
            should be examined. Responses to threats bring about change, which will usually
            create opportunity.
            SWOT analysis involves a mixture of internal and external factors:
            ●    Internal strengths: What are you good at?
                 For example, I can rewire a house more quickly than anyone else, so I should
                 focus on the domestic market where I excel over others.
            ●    Internal weaknesses: What do you believe you could do better?
                 This is normally something you don’t like to do. For example, I don’t fill in my
                 inspection forms very neatly as my handwriting is poor.
            ●    Opportunities in the external environment: What can you do that is different
                 or how can you adapt to a changing environment to address new opportunities
                 to be successful?
                 For example, the surge in people wishing to train has created a demand for
                 additional tutors, which gives me the opportunity to teach at evening classes.
            ●    Threats in the external environment.
                 The increase in general unemployment levels and the financial climate
                 has created a shortage of work across all industries. However, with my
                 qualifications I can look to work as an assessor for a Competent Person
                 Scheme operator, which is less prone to the financial challenges faced by
                 companies in the construction industry.
            These factors can be analysed for a particular venture or career objective and
            represented in a matrix or diagram format, to allow easy interpretation of the
            results.

                         INDUSTRY TIP        Having taken stock and reviewed your existing skills and qualifications, you need
                                             to consider what you would like to do in the future. Challenge and push yourself

              could lead you to become
              dissatisfied in your role.     milestones that you can achieve.
              Setting your targets too       Once you have decided what you want to do next, you should determine what
              high, too soon, could cause    you need to do and learn in order to achieve your goal. This will involve finding
              you to lose confidence and     out what is really required to fulfil the job or career objective, including what
              motivation to progress.        training you will need.

                                             Goal setting
                                             Setting goals is an important step towards a strategy for change that will lead you
                                             in the direction you want to go. People often refer to setting goals and objectives
                                             without any thought to the difference between the two terms. However, it is
                                             important to understand the difference, to avoid using the wrong terminology.
                                             ●         Goal: a strategic requirement or outcome that an individual or organisation is
                                                       trying to reach. It is likely to be quite general and long-range; it can look quite
                                                       idealistic and doesn’t include all the practical details of exactly what is required
                                                       and when it is required by. An example of a goal could be to have a complete
                                                       career change within the next five years. This may be not fully detailed but
                                                       that goal is the starting point in the planning process.
                                             ●         Objectives: short-term tactical approaches that help to achieve a goal. Asking
                                                       ‘who, why, what, where and when?’ questions will assist you in deciding
                                                       on appropriate objectives. They should be clearly defined and an effective
                                                       objective needs to be SMART.

            Personal goal setting
            Personal goal setting is an excellent way to think about your ideal future and
            motivate yourself to turn your vision of this future into reality. Setting goals helps
            you choose where you want to go in life. It is generally acknowledged that goal
            setting motivates individuals to ‘better themselves’ or to achieve more.
            Goals give an individual something to aim for. However, as with setting
            objectives, when setting a goal it is important that it is achievable. It is easy to be
            discouraged, go off target or even give up if your goal is not achievable. Impossible
            goals are merely pipe dreams, so aim high but keep it real.
            Goals give you the opportunity to study the ‘bigger picture’, to take stock of your
            wishes and aspirations and to set down what you want to do and where you
            would like to go.
            Initially, a brainstorming or concept-mapping session with a relative or mentor
            will allow you to record lots of different ideas. Goals can be selected in different
            categories or areas of life, such as:
            ●    career
            ●    education
            ●    relationships
            ●    finances.

                                           to achieve can often be demotivating. It is important that they are goals that you

                                           (see page 460). If you never meet any of the smaller goals used as midway
                                           markers, they will put you off instead of providing motivation.
                                           In summary, you should take these steps:
                                           1 Look at the bigger picture (assisted by brainstorming, mind mapping, etc.).
                                           2 Look at where you want to be (starting with only a few goals in small
                                             bite-sized chunks).
                                           3 Make sure the goals are your goals (not what someone else wants for you).
                                           4 Set milestone goals (to check you are on course and it is still what you want to
                                             do).
                                           5 Review and set short-term SMART objectives to ensure you meet your
                                             milestone goals.

            Documents to support career development
            There are a range of documents you can obtain or create to help you on the
            career path throughout your working life, from initially getting a job in the
            industry, to progressing further within the organisation once qualified, or perhaps
            setting up your own company.

            Career action plan
            A career action plan is a useful document for planning career development.
            It allows you to plan your career and development in your existing job, or to
            plan a different career path in the future. It helps you to look at the skills and
            qualifications you need to reach your goal, and then to monitor your progress.
            A typical career action plan can be developed by asking the following questions:
            ●    Where am I now and what electrical qualifications and skills do I possess?
            ●    What do I like about where I am and what skills do I most like to use (academic
                 or practical perhaps)?
            ●    What do I want to change, for example do I need to go further with my skills
                 and perhaps take an electrical short course such as Portable Appliance Testing
                 (City & Guilds 2377) or inspection and testing (City & Guilds 2391)?
            ●    How can I change what I don’t like, such as aspects of the electrician’s role that
                 I do not want to work on?
            ●    What will I need to create that change, and will I need further training in a
                 specific or specialist area?
            ●    How do I get there?
            After careful consideration, you can decide on a goal. An example might be to
            gain more experience in inspection and testing. You should set a target date for
            achieving your goal. In this example, it might be in 12 months’ time. In order to
            reach your goal, you will need to make a plan and put it into action.
            As you progress towards your goal, your action plan will make it clear when you
            are on track or going off track. It may even show that you need to change direction
            altogether, in which case you can re-plan and create a revised action plan.

            Plan–Do–Check–Act
            Many organisations use the Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA) process in their
            professional development or career development programmes. Also known as
            the Deming Cycle, the PDCA process is made up of these factors:
            ●    Plan – establish objectives to deliver the required goals.
            ●    Do – carry out the plan.                                                          Check                       Do

            ●    Check – study the results to spot any differences between the actions
                 planned and done.
            ●    Act/adjust – take corrective action to put the plan back on course.              p Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA)

                                                Applied logically, this approach can be used for any type of development process,
                                                personal or professional. Here is a career development example:

                                                ●   Do: within 8 months you obtain the qualification.
                                                ●   Check: after 10 months, no opportunities have arisen to work in a design

                                                    sized enterprises.
                                                ●   Act/adjust: as the opportunity to go straight into design has not arisen, work
                                                    closely with the organisation as an electrician but take an interest in the design
                                                    aspects – opportunities may come along.

                                                A portfolio is a collection of well-presented documents, such as your site-based
                                                portfolio, that demonstrates the type and nature of work an individual (usually a
                                                student or trainee) has carried out. It can be presented as a collection of evidence
                                                to show what the individual can do, either to the assessor of a course or to a

                         INDUSTRY TIP
                                                A CV is an important resumé of your work and professional experience to date.
              Employers usually scan CVs        Ideally CVs should be short and easily readable to keep the reader’s interest. They

                                                A good CV sets out all the details that a potential employer needs to decide
              essential to limit your CV to
                                                whether you have the skills and experience required for the position you are

              sure that the important           applying for. The details must be informative, clearly presented and to the point.
              information is clearly visible.   The aim is to get the employer to invite you for an interview.
                                                Make sure the information provided first is most specific to the role, for example
                                                listing your electrical qualifications before your GCSEs. Do the same with your
                                                experiences and achievements: there is no point listing a 50 m swimming badge
                                                at the top of your achievements when applying for a job as an electrician.
                                                Ensure you have some people who are able to provide a reference for you, should
                                                this be required. You must have their agreement.
                                                There are many different ways of presenting a CV. However, information must be
                                                presented in a logical order.

                                                Initial information
                                                This should include your personal details, address and contact information.

            Personal statement
            The next element of the CV should be a personal statement outlining your key
            strengths and achievements. Include those you think will be important and relevant
            to the potential employer. If possible, tailor this statement to suit the needs of each
            employer you contact, so that they can quickly check your skills and attributes
            against their requirements. Limit your personal statement to 200 words.

            Experience and qualifications
            It is often useful to indicate your work experience next. It is essential to identify
            all your relevant experience, without including any information that an employer
            does not need.
            It is usual to list work experience in reverse chronological order. This means
            presenting your current position first, with the date you were appointed,
            describing your role, responsibilities and any achievements or professional
            developments made.
            Repeat this for each previous employer. Consider including less detail, as you go
            back in time, to help keep your CV as brief as possible. There is little need for a
            chartered engineer of many years’ experience, for example, to go into much detail
            about their apprenticeship. It would be better to choose a few words to cover the
            overall experience and save the space for more important details elsewhere on
            the CV.
            If you are still studying, or if you have lots of experience in a large number of
            positions, you might choose to give your qualifications first so that a prospective
            employer can see them more quickly. Present your education in reverse
            chronological order, indicating all the educational establishments you have
            attended or are still attending.

            Other skills, hobbies and interests
            Next include other skills that are relevant but not job-specific. For example,
            you may have particular computer skills, fluency in a foreign language or be a
            qualified first-aider. A short section relating to your hobbies and interests may
            also be included if you feel they are particularly relevant to the position you are
            applying for.

            Referees
            If requested, you should provide the contact details for your referees (see
            ‘References’ below). However, if your CV is speculative and not in response to a
            specific request, you simply say that referees’ details are available on request so
            that you can keep control over other people’s contact information.

                                                    in the planning of the installation
                                                    For this task, consider what tasks must be done before others. For example, cables
                                                    cannot be pulled into conduits before the conduit is installed. If needed, make
                                                    some assumptions. Try to keep labour resources to a minimum but make sure
                                                    they are sufficient to keep the progression on time. Below is an example of how
                                                    this may work but there are several possibilities and right answers. Above all, it
                                                    needs to be logical.

            The sample shown here in the diagram below shows some of the items from
            the drawing. Note the detail in the description that goes beyond the key of the
            drawing such as colour, which would match PVC trunking. The number of ways
            and type of DB included also show understanding.

            Task 1b: Annotate the drawing to show
            routes for the PVC conduit runs to supply
            the ceiling mounted luminaires
            As for other tasks, there is no single right answer. Show a logical route and
            consider how the circuits are to be wired. Once you have decided how they are to
            be wired, show on your drawing where the conduits will go in the ceiling to supply
            each light and pick up each switch drop. The plug-in ceiling roses do not need to
            be directly over each luminaire, just close enough to supply with a flexible cable.

            Task 1c: Complete the design criteria
            within the design grid (circuit lengths are
            to be estimated using the scaled drawing)
            Below is a sample of the completed grid for this installation. Have a look at the
            values in the blue boxes and see how they have been established. Below the grid is
            an example of one circuit together with the calculations and assumptions.

            Circuit 1 (ring-final circuit)

            Information given in the grid-estimated design current (Ib) is 22 A, 32 A Type B
            circuit breaker, 58 m loop circuit length, meaning this is the length of cable leaving
            the DB, supplying each socket outlet and returning to the DB. You need to allow
            for two circuits grouped together.
            Because a ring-final circuit cable shares the load through parallel conductors,
            Regulation 433.1.204 in BS 7671 requires the chosen conductors, after all
            conditions are taken into account, to have a capacity no less than 20 A.
            As the circuit is installed in surface trunking, the reference installation method is B.
            As this building has HVAC and is therefore temperature controlled, I am assuming
            the ambient temperature at the height of the dado to be 25°C and from Table 4B1
            in BS 7671, this has a factor of 1.03. From Table 4C1, the factor for two circuits
            grouped as method B (A–F) is 0.8 so
                      20
                                 = 24.27   A
                 1.03 × 0.8

            From Table 4D1A of BS 7671, single-phase method B (column 4), a cable that has
            a tabulated value exceeding this is 4 mm2 with a value of 32. The 2.5 mm2 cable
            is quite close to call and so going by the calculation that the minimum exceeds
            24 A, this would not be acceptable.
            Alternatively, another suitable method to determine the minimum value is to take
            the value of It such as 24 for the 2.5 mm2 conductor and apply
                24 × 1.03 × 0.8 = 19.78 A

            As this is less than 20 A as given in Regulation 433.1.204, this is not acceptable so
            a 4 mm2 conductor is selected and
                32 × 1.03 × 0.8 = 26.37 A

            As this is greater than 20 A, this is acceptable.
            To calculate the overall voltage drop: the value of mV/A/m for a 4 mm2 conductor
            from Table 4D1B is 11 mV/A/m so voltage drop is
                 11 × 22 × 58                                      14.04
                                 = 14.04     but as it is a ring           = 3.51   V
                       1000                                         4


            Task 1d: Determine, for circuit 3
            a     the total earth fault loop impedance (assume the cpc to be one of the cores
                  in the cable)
            b     the suitability of this cpc for thermal constraints, using the formula contained
                  in Regulation 543.1.3 in BS 7671.

                                                For this task you will need to reference BS 7671 as well as the IET
                                                On-Site Guide for this task, and in particular, Table I1 and I3.
                                           a    The live conductors for circuit 3 are wired using single-core cables in trunking,
                                                bunched but the csa of the cpc is up to you to choose, as long as it is justified
                                                as correct.
                                           For this calculation, we will consider a 2.5 mm2 cpc so, using Table I1 and I3, we
                                           can calculate the R1 + R2 based on the circuit length of 10 m.
                                           Looking at Table I1, the value of mΩ/m for a 4/2.5 mm2 combination is 12.02
                                           mΩ/m.
                                           Looking at Table I3, the factor for allowing for the increase in resistance due to
                                           load is 1.2
                                                12.02 × 10 × 1.2
                                                                      = 0.14   Ω
                                                       1000

                                           So Zs is 0.3 + 0.14 = 0.44 Ω
                                           As the maximum permitted value of Zs from Table 41.3 for a 20 A Type B
                                           circuit breaker is 2.19 Ω and the calculated value of 0.44 Ω is less than this,
                                           disconnection under fault conditions will occur in time.
                                           Remember, justification is important and show clear stages to your calculations.
                                           As the total earth fault loop impedance is 0.44 Ω, the fault current will be
                                                230
                                                       = 522 A
                                               0.44
                                           This means disconnection will occur within 0.1 seconds using Appendix 3 of BS
                                           7671.
                                           Include justification once again.
                                           Looking at Table 54.4 from BS 7671, because the separate cpc is bunched with the
                                           live conductors, the value of k is 115.
                                           So
                                                     √5222 × 0.1
                                                S=                 = 1.4   mm2
                                                       115
                                           As the value from this calculation is 1.4 mm2, which is less than the actual cable
                                           csa of 2.5 mm2 for the cpc, this is suitable as the cable will handle the fault
                                           without getting too hot.
                                           Once again, show understanding through justification.

            Task 1e: Annotate the drawing showing
            where self-contained standalone
            emergency luminaires should be
            positioned (indicate if maintained)
            This task requires you to show on the drawing the positions of self-contained
            emergency luminaires. These may be maintained or non-maintained.
            Remember the golden rules to comply with BS 5266:
            ●    above any exit door and on the outside of final exits
            ●    any change of direction
            ●    any change of level (not applicable to this building)
            ●    any toilet area having no natural light
            ●    providing a minimum of 1 lux of light on designated escape routes
            ●    providing 0.5 lux in open areas.
            This is not a public building but a place of work where people are likely to be
            familiar with this simple building, so maintained lighting is probably not required.
            If it was provided, it would be suitable over doors as they are lit all the time, or
            when switched on with other lighting.
            Suitable locations for a luminaire include: each toilet, kitchen, above the DB, plant
            room, over each external door inside and out, one or two in the open repair room
            area.
