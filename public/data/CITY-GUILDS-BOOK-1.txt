            The City & Guilds Textbook: Electrical Installations Book 1


                                              About the author
                                              I started in the electrotechnical industry while still at school, chasing walls for my
                                              brother-in-law for a bit of pocket-money. This taught me quickly that if I took a
                                              career as an electrician I needed to progress as fast as I could.
                                              Jobs in the industry were few and far between when I left school so after a spell
                                              in the armed forces, I gained a place as a sponsored trainee on the Construction
                                              Industry Training Board (CITB) training scheme. I attended block release at
                                              Guildford Technical College, where the CITB would find me work experience
                                              with ‘local’ employers. My first and only work experience placement was with a
                                              computer installation company located over 20 miles away so I had to cycle there
                                              every morning, but I was desperate to learn, and enjoyed my work.
                                              Computer installations were very different in those days. Computers filled large
                                              rooms and needed massive armoured supply cables so the range of work I
                                              experienced was vast – from data cabling to all types of containment systems and
                                              low-voltage systems.
                                              In the second year of my apprenticeship I found employment with a company
                                              where most of my work centred around the London area. The work was varied,
                                              from lift systems in well-known high-rise buildings to lightning protection on the
                                              sides of even higher ones!
                                              On completion of my apprenticeship I worked for a short time as an intruder
                                              alarm installer, mainly in domestic dwellings – a role in which client relationships
                                              and handling information are very important.
                                              Following this I began work with a company where I was involved in shop-fitting
                                              and restaurant and pub refurbishments. It wasn’t long before I was managing jobs
                                              and gaining further qualifications through professional development. I was later
                                              seconded to the Property Services Agency, designing major installations within
                                              some of the best-known buildings in the UK.
                                              A career-changing accident took me into teaching, where I truly found the
                                              rewards the industry has to offer. Seeing young trainees maturing into qualified
                                              electricians is a highly gratifying experience. I often see many of my old trainees
                                              when they attend further training and updated courses. Following their successes
                                              makes it all worthwhile.
                                              I have worked with City & Guilds for over 25 years and represent them on a
                                              variety of industry committees, such as JPEL64, which is responsible for the
                                              production of BS 7671. I am passionate about using my extensive experience to
                                              maintain the high standards the industry expects.

            HEALTH AND SAFETY AND INDUSTRY PRACTICES




               INTRODUCTION
               Every year, accidents at work result in the deaths of more than one hundred people in Great Britain, with several
               hundred thousand more being injured in the workplace. In 2019/20, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) statistics
               recorded 38.8 million working days being lost due to work-related illness (32.5 million) and workplace injury
               (6.3 million).
               Occupational health and safety affects all individuals and aspects of work in the complete range of working
               environments – hospitals, factories, schools, universities, commercial undertakings, manufacturing plants and
               offices. As well as the human cost in terms of pain, grief and suffering, accidents in the workplace also have a
               financial cost, such as lost income, insurance and production disturbance. The HSE put this figure at £16.2 billion
               for the year 2018/19. It is therefore important to identify, assess and control the activities that may cause harm in
               the workplace.
               In addition to injuries to persons, construction site activities lead to many recorded incidents of land and air
               contamination impacting the environment we live in.
               This chapter is designed to enable you to understand health, safety and environmental legislation and
               associated practices and procedures, when installing and maintaining electrotechnical systems and equipment.
               You will need this knowledge to underpin the application of health, safety and environmental legislation,
               practices and procedures.

              In terms of common law, ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’ involves weighing a risk
              against the trouble, time and money needed to control it.


            In summary, criminal law seeks to protect everyone in society and civil law seeks
            to recompense individuals, to make amends for loss or harm they have suffered
            (i.e. provide compensation).

            The main legal requirements for health
            and safety at work
            The HSW Act 1974 is the basis of all British health and safety law. It provides a
            comprehensive and integrated piece of legislation that sets out the general duties
            that employers have towards employees, contractors and members of the public,
            and that employees have towards themselves and each other. These duties are
            qualified in the HSW Act by the principle of ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’.
            What the law expects is what good management and common sense would lead                                KEY TERM
            employers to do anyway; that is, to look at what the risks are and take sensible
                                                                                                                    Duty holder: the person
            measures to tackle those risks. The person(s) who is responsible for the risk and                       in control of the danger.
            best placed to control that risk is usually designated as the duty holder.
            The HSW Act lays down the general legal framework for health and safety in the
            workplace, with specific duties being contained in regulations, also called statutory
            instruments (SIs), which are also examples of laws approved by Parliament.

                                                   INDUSTRY TIP
              The duty holder must be competent by formal training and experience and have sufficient
              knowledge to avoid danger. The appropriate level of competence will differ for different
              areas of work.

                                              have legal responsibilities in respect of the health and safety of their employees

            2 HEALTH AND SAFETY
            LEGISLATION
            When the HSW Act came into force, there were already some 30 statutes and
            500 sets of regulations in place. The aim of the Health and Safety Commission
            (HSC) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was to progressively replace
            the existing regulations with a system of regulation that expresses general duties,
            principles and goals, with any supporting detail set out in ACoPs and guidance.

            Regulations
            Statutory Instruments (SIs) are laws approved by Parliament. The regulations
            governing health and safety are usually made under the HSW Act, following
            proposals from the HSC/HSE. This applies to regulations based on European
            Commission (EC) Directives as well as those produced in Great Britain.
            The HSW Act, and general duties in the Management Regulations, set goals and                                                    Status: This is the original version (as it was originally made). This

                                              is based on the principle of risk assessment as required by the Management of

            timber.
            However we define waste, its disposal is governed by legislation. Previously, the
            majority of construction waste went to landfill sites without any thought to the
            potential impact of the buried materials on the environment.
            European Union laws, that have been applied in the UK, have led to radical
            changes in waste handling and disposal. If you work within the construction
            industry, you need to have an understanding of those laws.

            Legislation to protect the environment
            The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) defines
            the environment as the land, water and air around us. Any pollution of land,                           INDUSTRY TIP

                                              The aim of this Act is to deal with environmental issues including waste on land,
                                              water pollution, air pollution and noise pollution. If a person or organisation is
                                              found guilty under this Act, they can be imprisoned or fined (or both), and they

                                              conviction.
                                              Local authorities require construction companies to apply for a permit under the
                                              Act prior to starting work. The construction company must carry out an analysis
                                              of the likely impact of noise and vibration on those in the surrounding area. The
                                              Act gives local authorities the power to impose restrictions on companies or
                                              individuals carrying out construction or demolition work, including imposing limits
                                              on noise levels and working times so as to avoid causing a nuisance to neighbours.

                                              Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA)
                                              The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) applies to England, Scotland and Wales. It

            Controlled waste is domestic, commercial and industrial waste – in fact, all waste
            that is disposed of on the land. Under the EPA, it is an offence for anyone to                          INDUSTRY TIP

            waste in undesignated sites).
            Part 2A of the EPA works on the principle of the ‘polluter pays’. The ‘polluter’ is
            defined as the person who caused the pollution or who ‘knowingly permitted’
            the contamination. ‘Knowingly permitted’ not only applies to allowing the
            contamination to take place but also to having knowledge of the contamination
            and failing to deal with it. Where the polluter is unknown then the occupier or
            owner of the land is responsible.
            Part 2A of the EPA applies where significant harm to the land has taken place
            or where the possibility of significant harm could take place or where rivers or
            groundwater are or could be affected.
                                                                                                            KEY TERMS

            The Environment Act 1995 set new standards for environmental management

                                              The Environment Agency has been given the powers to:
                                              ●	 stop offending taking place
                                              ●	 restore and/or remediate, for which it will seek to recover the costs

                                              ●	 punish and/or deter, whether that be by criminal or civil sanctions.

                                              The Environment Agency publishes all prosecutions and associated fines on their
                                              website and these range from a couple of thousand pounds for fishing without a
                                              licence to many hundreds of thousands of pounds for operating without a waste
                                              licence.

                                              Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005
                                              The Hazardous Waste Regulations set out a regime of control for the tracking and
                                              movement of hazardous waste, and deal with the production and disposal of that
                                              waste. Hazardous waste includes such items as:
                                              ●	   fluorescent tubes
                                              ●	   television sets
                                              ●	   fridges
                                              ●	   PC monitors
                                              ●	   batteries

                                              When hazardous waste is moved from one location to another, a consignment
                                              note must be completed and passed to the licensed waste carrier. Hazardous
                                              waste must be kept separate from general waste. Electrical wholesalers generally
                                              run schemes whereby fluorescent tubes can be returned to them for safe disposal.
                                              It is a requirement of the Hazardous Waste Regulations that records are kept for a
                                              period of three years.

                                              It is obvious that the poor waste model for packaging in Figure 1.5 is unsustainable.

            In the sustainable waste model, the packaging is made of materials that will cause
            minimum pollution in landfill sites. However, the materials are actually recyclable,
            thus cutting down waste and also reducing the demands on dwindling resources.
            The key person in this cycle is the person who ensures that the waste product is
            recycled.

            keeping of information on near misses is very important in helping to prevent
            accidents occurring. Research has shown that damage and near miss accidents
            occur much more frequently than injury accidents and therefore give an indication
            of hazards.

            The reporting of certain types of injury and incidents to the enforcing authority
            (the HSE or the local authority) is a legal requirement under the Reporting of
            Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR). Failure
            to comply with these regulations is a criminal offence.
            RIDDOR states that deaths, specified injuries (listed in the regulations) and injuries
            resulting in absence from work for over seven days, and dangerous occurrences
            (again, listed in the regulations) and occupational diseases must be reported.
            This seven-day period does not include the day of the accident, but does include
            weekends and rest days. The report must be made within 15 days of the accident.
            It is the responsibility of employers or the person in control of premises to
            report these types of incidents. Reportable specified injuries include fractures,
            amputations, permanent loss of sight, crush injuries and serious burns. A
            dangerous occurrence is a ‘near-miss’ event (incident with the potential to cause
            harm). There are also special requirements for gas incidents. Accidents must be
            recorded, but not reported, where they result in a worker being incapacitated for
            more than three consecutive days.
            The police and HSE have the right to investigate fatal accidents at work.
            Therefore, all fatal accidents must also be notified to the police. The police will
            often notify the HSE, but it is always a sensible precaution to ensure that the HSE
            has been notified.

            Escape of toxic fumes or gases
            Some gases are poisonous and can be dangerous to life at very low
            concentrations. Some toxic gases have strong smells such as the distinctive
            ‘rotten eggs’ smell of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The measurements most often
            used for the concentration of toxic gases are parts per million (ppm) and parts
            per billion (ppb). More people die from toxic gas exposure than from explosions
            caused by the ignition of flammable gas. With toxic substances, the main concern
            is the effect on workers of exposure to even very low concentrations. These could
            be inhaled, ingested (swallowed) or absorbed through the skin. Since adverse
            effects can often result from cumulative, long-term exposure, it is important to
            measure not only the concentration of gas, but also the total time of exposure.

            Gas explosion
            A gas explosion is an explosion resulting from a gas leak in the presence of an
            ignition source. The main explosive gases are natural gas, methane, propane
            and butane because they are widely used for heating purposes in temporary
            and permanent situations. However, many other gases, such as hydrogen, are
            combustible and have caused explosions in the past.
            The source of ignition can be anything from a naked flame to the electrical energy
            in a piece of equipment. Industrial gas explosions can be prevented with the use
            of intrinsic safety barriers to prevent ignition. The principle behind intrinsic safety
            is to ensure that the electrical and thermal energy from any electrical equipment
            in a hazardous area is kept low enough to prevent the ignition of flammable gas.
            Items such as electric motors would not be permitted in a hazardous area.

            Employer and employee responsibilities
            Employers have a duty of care to each of their employees. This duty rests solely
            with the employer and cannot be assigned to other persons – for example,
            consultants who offer advice on health and safety matters, or sub-contractors
            who are employed to undertake tasks within the company. All organisations
            should have a clear policy for the management of health and safety. The policy
            sets the direction for health and safety within the organisation, and its contents
            need to be clearly communicated to everyone within the organisation to ensure
            everyone understands what their responsibilities are in day-to-day operations.

                                              Everyone has responsibility for safety, but employers have the following duties
                                              under the HSW Act:
                                              ●	 the health, safety and welfare at work of employees, and other workers
                                                 whether they are contractors, casual, temporary, part time or trainees
                                              ●	 the health and safety of anyone who is allowed to use the organisation’s

                                                 equipment
                                              ●	 the health and safety of anyone who may be affected by the organisation’s

                                                 activities, i.e. the general public or adjacent organisations or neighbours.
                                              Examples of matters under the control of an employer include:
                                              ●	 establishing policy to ensure that electrical equipment is purchased to an
                                                 appropriate specification
                                              ●	 establishing policy to ensure that electrical equipment is properly maintained

                                                 (including user inspection)
                                              ●	 implementing policy through the introduction of appropriate management systems

                                              ●	 on-going monitoring to confirm that the policy is properly implemented and

                                                 remains fully relevant.
                                              Employees have specific responsibilities under the HSW Act and these can be
                                              summarised as:
                                              ●	 to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and others who
                                                 may be affected by their acts or omissions at work
                                              ●	 to co-operate with their employer and others to enable them to fulfil their

                                                 legal obligations
                                              ●	 not to interfere with or deliberately misuse anything provided in the interests

                                                 of health and safety.
                                              Examples of matters under the control of an employee include:
                                              ●	 adherence to company procedures and systems of work
                                              ●	 use of equipment in accordance with information and training provided

                                              ●	 not to use equipment that is faulty or damaged but to report it in accordance

                                                 with company arrangements for dealing with defective equipment.
                                              In summary, under the HSW Act employers have duties to ensure that appropriate
                                              management systems are established so that electrical work can be undertaken
                                              in a safe manner, while employees have a responsibility to comply fully with such

                                              The process of cleaning can itself create slip and trip hazards, especially for those
                                              entering the area being cleaned, including those undertaking the cleaning. Smooth
                                              floors left damp by a mop are likely to be extremely slippery. Trailing wires from a
                                              vacuum cleaner or polishing machine can present an additional trip hazard.
                                              People often slip on floors that have been left wet after cleaning. Access to
                                              smooth wet floors should be restricted by using barriers, locking doors or cleaning
                                              in sections. Signs and warning cones only warn of a hazard – they do not prevent
                                              people from entering the area. If the water on the floor is not visible, signs and
                                              cones are usually ignored.

                                              Human factors
                                              How people act and behave in their work environments can affect the risk of slips
                                              and trips. Accidents can be reduced by:
                                              ●	 having a positive attitude toward health and safety – e.g. dealing with a
                                                 spillage right away instead of waiting for someone else to deal with it
                                              ●	 wearing the correct footwear

                                              ●	 concentrating and avoiding distractions, such as being in a hurry, carrying large

                                                 objects or using a mobile phone, all of which increase the risk of an accident.

                                              Environmental factors
                                              Environmental issues can affect the incidence of slips and trips. For example:
                                              ●	   Too much light on a shiny floor can cause glare and stop people from seeing

            Footwear
            Footwear can play an important part in preventing slips and trips. For example:

                 durability, as well as obvious safety features such as providing the protection                INDUSTRY TIP

            The requirements for a risk assessment

                                              The HSE promotes a risk assessment process entitled Five Steps to Risk
                                              Assessment. The five steps are as follows (and covered in further detail later in the
                                              section).
                                              Step 1	   Identify the hazards.
                                              Step 2	   Decide who may be harmed and how.
                                              Step 3	   Evaluate the risks and decide on precautions.
                                              Step 4	   Record the findings and implement them.
                                              Step 5	   Review the assessment and update if necessary.
                                              It is important to remember that a risk assessment is a continual process, as the
                                              circumstances are constantly changing. Therefore, although the five steps are
                                              shown as a list, the process tends to be more of a cycle (Figure 1.12).

                                              Step 1: Identify the hazard

              reviewed as the working
              environment changes.            The person doing the risk assessment should also consider the specific work
                                              environment, so it can be helpful to talk to others who have performed the task.
                                              Remember a risk assessment must be specific to the exact task being performed
                                              in a certain place – generic risk assessments are only a starting point.

                                              Step 2: Assess harm
                                              When assessing the potential for harm, consider where the task is being
                                              performed – different locations may change the risk. For example, using a power
                                              tool in a public place involves a different set of risks compared to use of the power
                                              tool in a workshop or factory because the people in a place of work are more
                                              aware of risks than members of the public. Remember, the same task performed
                                              by different people may present different hazards, according to each person’s
                                              knowledge, experience and work ethic.

            Some hazards have different impacts depending on who is involved. For example,
            a person in a wheelchair may be at a particular risk from an activity, whereas a
            non-disabled person may be able to avoid the hazard. Having identified who may
            be at risk, the next stage is to think about how they could be harmed. Essentially,
            all the people at risk must be identified, as well as the potential harm that could
            be caused.                                                                                  KEY TERM
                                                                                                        Young people: people

            assessments need to be made, known as Young Person Risk Assessments.

            Step 3: Evaluate risks
            Once you have identified the hazard, established who may be affected and in
            what ways, you must plan how to remove the risks. At this stage, it is a good idea
            to rank the risks in terms of likelihood and severity of outcome. It may not be
            possible to remove some risks and so a level of control may be more appropriate,
            such as the use of barriers.
            A simple way to rank the risks is to consider them in terms of impact versus
            likelihood of the risk happening. A complex numbering system can be used to
            score the risk: the higher the number the more important it is to reduce the risk.
            Alternatively, a simple ‘traffic light’ matrix can be used, as shown in Figure 1.13.

                                                                    Impact

            ●	 Red: high risks that must be controlled. Work cannot proceed until these risks
               are removed or reduced.
            ●	 Amber: medium-level risks. The control measure is to ensure the safest

               working procedures and practices are being applied.
            ●	 Green: minor and unavoidable risks. There should be a plan for what to do if

               the hazard should occur.
            It is possible for hazards to move from one level of risk to another as work is
            undertaken. Therefore, the risk assessment must be constantly monitored and
            evaluated.

                                              Once the risks have been ranked into red, amber and green classifications,
                                              solutions need to be implemented. The approach to risk management includes a
                                              hierarchy of control, which should be approached in this sequence:
                                              1	   Elimination
                                              2	   Reduction
                                              3	   Enclosure
                                              4	   Remove persons
                                              5	   Reduce contact.
                                              Risk management option 1, Elimination, is the most effective and should always be
                                              the first choice. Risk management option 5, Reduce contact, is the least effective,
                                              but is often chosen – it covers the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
                                              Other control measures that can also be used include:

            Control of high-level risks
            If the risk level identified is high, the control measures may need to be more
            extensive. The aim of risk assessment is to reduce all residual risks to as low
            a level as reasonably practicable and use the resulting information to prepare
            control measures as necessary. Many hazards have specific regulations or
            guidance available to give advice on reducing the risk (e.g. lead, electricity,
            asbestos) and these should be referred to in the first instance, to obtain advice for
            the preparation of control measures.

            without risk to health. The method statement should be clear, and illustrated

              Permit-to-work (PTW):                     that ensures that potentially dangerous work is done safely. Examples include
              a written safe system of                  work in confined spaces, hot work, work with asbestos-based materials, work

            The hierarchy of control
            The control of risk is essential to the provision of a safe working environment that
            complies with all of the relevant legal requirements. To maintain this safe working
            environment, any control measures (detailed below) that are produced require
            assessment and, if necessary, amendment or the introduction of new measures.
            There is an acknowledged ‘hierarchy of control’, which is simply a list of measures
            designed to control risks that are considered in order of importance, effectiveness
            or priority. This control sequence normally begins with an extreme measure
            of control and ends with personal protective equipment as a last resort. If we
            consider a task such as working near a big hole in the ground, we consider:
            1	   Eliminate – does the hole need to be there, or can it be filled in?
            2	   Substitute – can the task be done somewhere else?
            3	   Isolate – e.g. by putting something over the hole to cover it
            4	   Control – e.g. by introducing guarding around the hole

            Losing or damaging your sight can have a life-changing effect, not just on your
            ability to work, but on your standard and way of living. The types of hazard that
            can affect your eyes include:

            Many injuries occur when people hold items that they are trying to cut or drill. In
            such cases, training in the correct cutting or drilling technique might be a better
            solution than PPE.
            There are several PPE options for protecting hands and arms:
            ●	 gloves made of different material based on the protection needed, such as oil
               resistance, anti-cut, anti-slip
            ●	 gauntlets, which provide protection further up the arm.

              KEY TERM
                                              Implications of being exposed to asbestos
              Abraded: scraped or worn
              away by friction.               Asbestos commonly comes in the form of chrysotile (white asbestos), amosite
                                              (brown asbestos) and crocidolite (blue asbestos). Chrysotile is the common
                                              form of asbestos and accounts for 90–95% of all asbestos in circulation. When
              HEALTH AND SAFETY               abraded or drilled, asbestos produces a fine dust with fibres small enough to be
              Any potential contact           taken into the lungs. Asbestos fibres are very sharp and can lead to mesothelioma
              with asbestos should be         (cancer of the lining of the lung), lung cancer, asbestosis (scarring of the lung),
              treated seriously as the
                                              diffuse pleural thickening (thickening and hardening of the lung wall) and death.
              health risks can be severe.

                                              The requirement for first aid facilities
                                              In the event of injury or sudden illness, failure to provide correct first aid could
                                              result in death. Employers must ensure that an employee who is injured or taken
                                              ill at work receives immediate attention.
                                              The Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 require employers to provide
                                              adequate and appropriate equipment, facilities and personnel to ensure their
                                              employees receive immediate attention if they are injured or taken ill at work.
                                              These Regulations apply to all workplaces, including those with fewer than five
                                              employees and to the self-employed.

            What is ‘adequate and appropriate’ will depend on the circumstances in the
            workplace, and employers should carry out an assessment of first aid needs to                        INDUSTRY TIP
            determine what to provide. There are a number of factors to be considered:
                                                                                                          Access the Health and Safety

            This will determine whether trained first aiders are needed, what should be
            included in a first aid box and whether or not a first aid room is required. The HSE
            suggests at least one appointed first aider where a low-risk business, such as a
            shop or office, has fewer than 25 staff members.

            The first aid box
            There is no standard list of items that need to be contained in a first aid box and
            the contents depend on what the employer or the ‘person in control of the site’             	 Figure 1.28 A well-stocked first

            assesses the needs to be. However, tablets or medicines should not be kept in first
            aid boxes. It is sensible to have an ‘appointed person’ to look after the first aid
            equipment and replenish when required.
            Emergencies can occur at any time and there may well be an immediate need for
            items without having to search for them. Items in first aid boxes should not be
            taken for other uses. Items are needed for particular reasons and therefore misuse
            will decrease supplies.

            Fire safety
            Most fires are preventable and by adopting the right behaviours and procedures,
                                                                                                                 EN

            How combustion takes place
            A fire needs three elements to start:                                                                   FUEL

            If any one of these elements is removed, a fire will not ignite or will cease to burn.
            ●	 Sources of ignition include heaters, lighting, naked flames, electrical
               equipment, smokers’ materials (cigarettes, matches) and anything else that can

                                               adequate and appropriate fire safety measures are in place to minimise the risk
                                               of injury or loss of life in the event of a fire. These findings must be kept up to

                                               Dangers of working with heat-producing equipment
                                               The use of heat-producing equipment (hot work) is a common occurrence in
                                               building services work activities. Hot work is work that might generate sufficient
                                               heat, sparks or flame to cause a fire. It includes welding, flame cutting, soldering,
                                               brazing, grinding and other equipment that incorporates a flame, such as boilers
                                               or furnaces.
                                               The flames, sparks and heat produced during the hot work are ignition sources
                                               that can cause fires and explosions in many different situations. For example:
                                               ●	 sparks produced during hot work can land on combustible materials and cause
                                                  fires and explosions
                                               ●	 hot work performed on tanks and vessels with residual flammable substances

                                                  and vapours can cause the tanks to explode.
                                               To help prevent fire in the workplace, the risk assessment should identify what
                                               could cause a fire to start (the sources of ignition (heat or sparks), the substances
                                               that burn) and the people who may be at risk.
                                               Once the risks have been identified, appropriate action can be taken to control
                                               them. Actions should be based on whether the risks can be avoided altogether or,
                                               if this is not possible, how they can be reduced. The checklist below will help with

            Fires involving equipment such as electrical circuits or electronic equipment
            are often referred to as Class E fires, although the category does not officially
            exist under the BS EN 3 rating system. This is because electrical equipment is
            often the cause of the fire, rather than the actual type of fire. Most modern fire
            extinguishers specify on the label whether they should be used on electrical
            equipment. Normally carbon dioxide or dry powder are suitable agents for putting
            out a fire involving electricity.

            Manual handling

              before moving an object
              from one place to another       ●	 The handling equipment – mechanical handling equipment must be suitable
              by manual handling?                for the task, well maintained and inspected on a regular basis.
                                              ●	 The load – the load needs to be prepared in such a way as to minimise

                                                 accidents, taking into account such things as security of the load, flammable

                                              ●	 The workplace – if possible, the workplace should be designed to keep the

                                                 workforce and the load apart.
                                              ●	 The human element – employees who use the equipment must be properly

                                                 trained.

                                               When you are manually handling a load, always make sure the route you will be taking is clear
                                               and all obstacles are removed. Never try to lift more than you can handle. Use safe handling
                                               techniques. Get someone to help you or use mechanical assistance to move the object.

            AND WORKING IN CONFINED
            SPACES OR EXCAVATONS
            Working at height
            Working at height remains one of the biggest causes of fatalities and major
            injuries within the construction industry with almost 20% of fatalities resulting
            from falls from ladders, stepladders and through fragile roofs (figures taken
            from the HSE website, February 2022). Work at height means work in any place,
            including at or below ground level (e.g. in underground workings), where a person
            could fall a distance liable to cause injury.
            The Work at Height Regulations 2005 require duty holders to ensure that:
                                                                                                               INDUSTRY TIP
            ●	   all work at height is properly planned and organised
            ●	   those involved in work at height are competent                                         Access the Work at Height
            ●	   the risks from work at height are assessed and appropriate work equipment is           Regulations 2005 by
                 selected and used                                                                      searching the HSE website.
            ●	   the risks of working on or near fragile surfaces are properly managed
            ●	   the equipment used for work at height is properly inspected and maintained.

            Access equipment for different types of work at height
            Many different types of access equipment are used in the building services
            industry, such as mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs), ladders, mobile
            tower scaffolds, tube and fitting scaffolding, and personal suspension equipment
            (harnesses).

            Mobile elevating work platforms
            There is a wide range of MEWPs (vertical scissor lift, self-propelled boom, vehicle-
            mounted boom and trailer-mounted boom) and if any of these is to be used it is
            important to consider:
            ●	   the height from the ground
            ●	   whether the MEWP is appropriate for the job                                            HEALTH AND SAFETY

                                               It is recommended that ladders are only used for low-risk, short-duration work
                                               (between 15 and 30 minutes depending upon the task). Common causes of falls
                                               from ladders are:
                                               ●	 overreaching – maintain three points of contact with the ladder
                                               ●	 slipping from the ladder – keep the rungs clean, wear non-slip footwear,

                                                  maintain three points of contact with the ladder, make sure the rungs are
                                                  horizontal
                                               ●	 the ladder slips from its position – position the ladder on a firm, level surface,

                                                  secure the ladder top and bottom, check the ladder daily

            Scaffolding
            Some work activities, such as painting, roof work, window replacement or
            brickwork, are almost certainly more conveniently undertaken from a fixed
            external scaffold. Tube and fitting scaffolding must only be erected by competent
            people who have attended recognised training courses. Any alterations to the
            scaffolding must also be carried out by a competent person. Regular inspections
            of the scaffold must be made and recorded.

                                              while working in excavations. These excavations may be required in the course of
                                              ground source heating projects or the installation of drains and soakaways, septic

                                              How to prepare excavations for safe working
                                              The hazards associated with excavations are:
                                              ●	   excavations collapsing and burying or injuring people working in them
                                              ●	   material falling from the sides into any excavation
                                              ●	   people or plant falling into excavations
                                              ●	   contact with underground services (e.g. electricity, high-pressure water and
                                                   gas)
                                              ●	   undermining other structures
                                              ●	   exhaust fumes from petrol or diesel-engine equipment such as compressors or
                                                   generators.
                                              Planning is the key to the safety of any excavation. Before work commences a
                                              decision will be required on what temporary support will be needed and what
                                              precautions need to be taken. The equipment and precautions needed (trench
                                              sheets, props, baulks, etc.) should be available on site before work starts.

              unsafe working area to          A confined space is a place which is substantially enclosed (though not always
              collapse and suffocate          entirely) and where serious injury can occur from hazardous substances or
              you.                            conditions within the space or nearby (e.g. lack of oxygen). Examples include
                                              chambers, tanks, vessels, furnaces, boilers or cisterns, inspection chambers, pits,
                                              roof spaces and under suspended timber floors. Entry into a confined space
                                              requires the correct equipment, including PPE and a harness. Activities below
                                              ground require a descent control and rescue system.
                                              The two main hazards associated with confined spaces are the presence of toxic
                                              or other dangerous substances and the absence of adequate oxygen.
                                              The Confined Space Regulations 1997 detail the specific controls that are
                                              necessary when people enter confined spaces. These can be summarised as
                                              follows.
                                              ●	 Avoid entry to confined spaces (e.g. by doing the work from the outside).
                                              ●	 If entry to a confined space is unavoidable, follow a safe system of work which
                                                 should include rigorous preparation, isolation, air testing and other precautions,
                                                 and the use of a confined space entry permit.
                                              ●	 Put in place adequate emergency arrangements before the work starts.

                                              Adequate ventilation, sufficient lighting, the provision of the correct PPE, emergency
                                              evacuation procedures and medical conditions must all be catered for. Lone working
                                              should not be allowed. Section 706 of BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th
                                              Edition gives the requirements for supplies to portable electrical equipment used in
                                              confined spaces that are restrictive and/or conducting.

                        INDUSTRY TIP          source of energy and is in use in every factory, office, workshop and home in the
                                              country. However, this energy source also has the potential to be very hazardous,

              Work Regulations 1989
                                              Regulations 1989 were made under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974

              website.                        (HSW Act) and came into force on 1 April 1990.
              Guidance on following these
              regulations is contained in     Common electrical dangers on site
              HSE document HSR25.             The 1989 Regulations are goal-setting in that they specify the objectives
                                              concerning the design, specification and construction of, and work activities

                                              not specify the means for achieving these objectives. The 1989 Regulations are
                                              supported by a Memorandum of Guidance, HSR25 (2nd edition 2007).
                                              Electrical injuries can be caused by a wide range of voltages, and are dependent

            higher voltages. Alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) electrical supplies
            can cause a range of injuries including:
            ●	   electric shock
            ●	   electrical burns
            ●	   loss of muscle control
            ●	   fires arising from electrical causes
            ●	   arcing and explosion.

            Electric shock
            Electric shocks may arise either by direct contact with a live part or indirectly by
            contact with an exposed conductive part (e.g. a metal equipment case) that has
            become live as a result of a fault condition.
            Faults can arise from a variety of sources:
            ●	 broken equipment case exposing internal bare live connections
            ●	 cracked equipment case causing ‘tracking’ from internal live parts to the

               external surface                                                                        	 Figure 1.37 Approach someone

            The magnitude (size) and duration of the shock current are the two most                       at risk
            significant factors determining the severity of an electric shock. The magnitude of
            the shock current will depend on the contact voltage and impedance (electrical
            resistance) of the shock path. A possible shock path always exists through ground
            contact (e.g. hand-to-feet). In this case:
                        shock path impedance = body impedance + any external impedance

            A more dangerous situation is a hand-to-hand shock path, where the current
            flow is through the heart. This is when one hand is in contact with an exposed
            conductive part (e.g. an earthed metal equipment case), while the other
            simultaneously touches a live part. In this case the current will be limited only by
            the body impedance.
            As the voltage increases, so the body impedance decreases, which increases the
            shock current. When the voltage decreases, the body impedance increases, which
            reduces the shock current. This has important implications concerning the voltage
            levels that are used in work situations and highlights the advantage of working with
            reduced low-voltage (110 V) systems or battery-operated hand tools.                         KEY TERM

            Electrical burn
            Burns may arise due to:
            ●	 the passage of shock current through the body, particularly if at high voltage
            ●	 exposure to high-frequency radiation (e.g. from radio transmission antennas).

                                              Loss of muscle control
                                              People who experience an electric shock often get painful muscle spasms that can
                                              be strong enough to break bones or dislocate joints. This loss of muscle control
                                              often means the person cannot ‘let go’ or escape the electric shock. The person
                                              may fall if they are working at height or be thrown into nearby machinery and
                                              structures.

                                              Fire
                                              Electricity is believed to be a factor in the cause of many fires in domestic and
                                              commercial premises in Britain each year. One of the principal causes of such fires
                                              is wiring with defects such as insulation failure, the overloading of conductors,
                                              lack of electrical protection, or poor connections.

                                              Arcing
                                              Arcing frequently occurs due to a short circuit (conductive bridge between
                                              live parts) caused while working on live equipment (either intentionally or
                                              unintentionally). Arcing generates UV radiation, causing severe sunburn. Molten
                                              metal particles are also likely to be deposited on exposed skin surfaces.

                                              Explosion
                                              There are two main electrical causes of explosion:
                                              ●	   short circuit due to an equipment fault
                                              ●	   ignition of flammable vapours or liquids caused by sparks or high surface
                                                   temperatures.

                                              Controlling current flow
                                              It is necessary to include devices in circuits to control current flow – that is,
                                              to switch the current on or off by making or breaking the circuit. This may be
                                              required:
                                              ●	 for functional purposes (to switch equipment on or off)
                                              ●	 for use in an emergency (switching off in the event of an accident)

                                              ●	 so that equipment can be switched off to prevent its use and allow

                                                 maintenance work to be done safely on the mechanical parts
                                              ●	 to isolate a circuit, installation or piece of equipment to prevent the risk

                                                 of shock where exposure to electrical parts and connections is likely for
                                                 maintenance purposes.

              and separating from             from all sources of electrical energy. A variety of control devices are available
              all sources of electrical       for switching, isolation or a combination of these functions, some incorporating
              energy.

            Electrical supply for tools and equipment
            Portable electric tools can provide valuable assistance with much of the physical
            effort required in electrotechnical activities. These tools can use different sources
            of electrical supply (mains or battery) and different means of maintaining safety
            in relation to that electrical supply.
            Basic equipment construction is aimed at preventing the risk of electric shock.
            The Construction of Electrical Equipment for Protection against Electric Shock is
            summarised below.

            Class I
            The basic insulation may be an air gap and/or some form of insulating material.
            External conductive parts (e.g. the metal case) must be earthed by providing the
            supply through a three-core supply lead incorporating a protective conductor. The
            most important aspect of any periodic inspection or testing of Class I equipment
            is to check the integrity of this protective conductor. There is no recognised
            symbol for Class I equipment, though some appliances may show the symbol in                	 Figure 1.38 This symbol may
            Figure 1.38.                                                                                  appear on Class I earthed
                                                                                                          items
            Class II
            Class II equipment has either no external conductive parts apart from fixing
            screws (insulation-encased equipment) or there is adequate insulation between
            any external conductive parts and the internal live parts to prevent the former
            becoming live as a result of an internal fault (metal-encased equipment). Periodic
            inspection or testing needs to focus on the integrity of the insulation. Class II          	 Figure 1.39 This symbol may
                                                                                                          appear on Class II items
            equipment is identified by the symbol shown in Figure 1.39.

            Class III
            This method of protection is not designed to prevent shock but to reduce its
            severity and therefore make the shock more survivable. The supply (no greater
            than 50 V AC) must be provided from a separated extra-low-voltage (SELV) source
            such as a safety isolating transformer conforming to BS EN 61558, or a battery.
                                                                                                             III
            Class III equipment is identified by the diamond symbol and the safety isolating
            symbol by two interlinked circles, as shown in Figure 1.40.                                	 Figure 1.40 This symbol may
            Another way of reducing the risk of electric shock is by using a reduced low-                 appear on Class III items
            voltage system. This is not a Class III system but is a safer arrangement than using
            mains-operated (230 V) equipment because of the lower potential shock voltage.
            Supply is provided via a mains powered (230 V) step-down transformer with the
            centre point of the secondary winding connected to earth.

                                              Low-voltage electrical supplies for tools and equipment
                                              The human body’s impedance increases with lower touch voltages, particularly
                                              below 50 V. Although 50 V can be dangerous in certain circumstances, if the
                                              system voltage can be reduced to around this level, then the magnitude (size) of
                                              any current flow through the body will be significantly reduced.
                                              The most common low-voltage system of this type in use in the UK uses a
                                              230/110 V double-wound step-down transformer with the secondary winding
                                              centre-tapped and connected to earth (CTE). While the supply voltage for
                                              equipment supplied from such a transformer is 110 V, the maximum voltage to
                                              earth is 55 V (63.5 V for a 110 V three-phase system). This is covered in BS 7671
                                              The IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition (Regulation 411.8 Reduced low-voltage
                                              systems). Overcurrent protection for the 110 V supply may be provided by fuses at
                                              the transformer’s 110 V output terminals or by a thermal trip to detect excessive
                                              temperature rise in the secondary winding. The latter method is generally employed
                                              for portable units. Such reduced voltage supplies may be provided:
                                              ●	 through fixed installations (workshops, plant rooms, lift rooms or other areas
                                                 where portable electrical equipment is in frequent use)
                                              ●	 through small portable transformers designed to supply individual portable

                                                 tools. (See BS 4363: 1998 and BS 7375: 1996, which give a specification for
                                                 the distribution of electricity on building and construction sites, based on the
                                                 use of 230/110 V CTE transformers.)
                                              One additional advantage of using a reduced low-voltage system is that this
                                              safeguard applies to all parts of the system on the load side of the transformer,
                                              including the flexible leads, as well as the tools, hand lamps, and so on.
                                              Alternatively, cordless or battery-powered tools offer a convenient way of
                                              providing a powered hand tool without the inconvenience of using a mains supply
                                              and without the hazard of trailing power leads.

            How to conduct a visual inspection of
            portable electrical equipment
            To maintain the safety and integrity of tools and equipment, regular in-service
            inspection and testing should be undertaken to confirm that the equipment
            remains in a safe condition. Portable appliance testing (PAT) is the term used to
            describe the examination of electrical appliances and equipment to ensure they
            are safe to use. There are three categories of in-service inspection or testing for
            portable tools and equipment:
            ●	 user checks (pre-use inspections) – users play an important role by checking
               equipment before use for signs of damage or obvious defects liable to affect
               safety in use
            ●	 periodic formal inspection or checks

            ●	 periodic combined inspection and testing.

            The user checks are a visual check only. They should deal with the following
            inspection requirements separately for the equipment, supply lead and plug.
            Visual inspection of equipment:
            ●	 Equipment should be manufactured to relevant standards (BS or BS EN).
            ●	 The casing should have no visible damage and be free from dents and cracks.
            ●	 The switches should operate correctly.

            ●	 The supply lead should be secure and correctly connected.

            ●	 Equipment should be suitable for the task.

            Visual inspection of supply leads:
            ●	   Supply leads should be manufactured to relevant standards (BS or BS EN).
            ●	   They should be suitable for the environment.
            ●	   They should be free from cuts or fraying.
            ●	   There should be no visible exposed conductor insulation (damaged sheath) or
                 exposed live conductors.
            ●	   There should be no signs of damage to the cord sheath.
            ●	   There should be no joints evident.

                                               Visual inspection of supply lead plugs:
                                               ●	 Supply lead plugs should be manufactured to relevant standards (BS or BS EN).
                                               ●	 The insulation should have no damage.
                                               ●	 The cord or cable connections should be correct and secure.

                                               The user checks must be backed up by periodic inspection and, where appropriate,
                                               testing. At that time, a thorough examination is undertaken by a nominated
                                               person, competent for that purpose. Schedules giving details of inspection and
                                               maintenance periods, together with records of the inspection, should form part of
                                               the procedure.

                                               visual inspection
                                               Most electrical safety defects can be found by visual examination, but some
                                               types of defect, such as a broken earth conductor, can only be found by testing.
                                               However, it is essential to understand that visual examination is an essential part
                                               of the process because some types of electrical safety defect cannot be detected
                                               by testing alone.
                                               A relatively brief user check, based upon simple training and the use of a brief
                                               checklist, is a very useful part of any electrical maintenance regime. If the user
                                               checks detailed above are carried out, 95% of all faults will be identified and
                                               the appropriate action taken. No record is needed if there are no defects found.
                                               However, if equipment is found to be unsafe, it must be removed from service
                                               immediately. It must be labelled to show that it must not be used and the fault
                                               must be reported to a responsible person.


                                               8 SAFE ISOLATION
                                               Isolation can be very complex due to the differing industrial, commercial
                                               and domestic working environments, some of which require experience and
                                               knowledge of the system processes. This section deals with a basic practical
                                               procedure for isolation and for the securing of isolation. It also looks at the
                                               reasons for safe isolation and the potential risks involved during the isolation
                                               process.
                                               Safe operating procedures for the isolation of plant and machinery during both
                                               electrical and mechanical maintenance must be prepared and followed. Wherever
                                               possible, electrical isolators should be fitted with a means by which the isolating

                                               to prevent danger, suitable means (including, where appropriate, methods of
                                               identifying circuits) must be available for:

               circuit arrangements giving rise to back feeds).
            ●	 Secure – Keeping safe; achieved by locking off with a safety lock (i.e. a lock

               with a unique key). The posting of a warning notice also serves to alert others
               to the isolation.

            How to undertake a basic practical
            procedure for isolation
            Being able to perform safe isolation is a key skill every electrician needs. Be sure to
            do this under supervision by a skilled person such as your tutor.

            Carry out the practical isolation
            The method of isolation is outlined below.
            1	 Identify – identify equipment or circuit to be worked on and point(s) of
               isolation.
            2	 Isolate – switch off, isolate and lock off (secure) equipment or circuit in an
               appropriate manner. Retain the key and post caution signs with details of work
               being carried out.
            3	 Check – check the condition of the voltage indicator leads and probes. Confirm
               that the voltage indicator is functioning correctly by using a proving unit.
            4	 Test – using the voltage indicator, test the outgoing terminals of the isolation
               switch. Take precautions against adjacent live parts where necessary.
            	      During single-phase isolation, there are three tests to be carried out (L =
                   line, N = neutral, E = earth):
            	      L – N	     L – E	 N – E
                                                                                                       ACTIVITY
            	      During three-phase isolation, there are 10 possible tests (if the neutral is
                                                                                                       Discuss why the N or E
                   present):
                                                                                                       probe is connected before
            	      L1 – N	 L2 – N	 L3 – N                                                              the Line when carrying out
            	      L1 – E	     L2 – E	     L3 – E                                                      this test.
            	      L1 – L2	 L1 – L3	 L2 – L3
            	      N–E
            5	 Prove – using the voltage indicator and proving unit, prove that the voltage
               indicator is still functioning correctly.
            6	 Confirm – confirm that the isolation is secure and the correct equipment has
               been isolated. This can be achieved by operating functional switching for the
               isolated circuit(s). The relevant inspection and testing can now be carried out.

            Reinstate the supply
            When the ‘dead’ electrical work is completed, you must ensure that all electrical
            barriers and enclosures are in place and that it is safe to switch on the isolated
            circuit.
            1	 Remove the locking device and danger/warning signs.
            2	 Reinstate the supply.
            3	 Carry out system checks to ensure that the equipment is working correctly.

            Implications of safe isolation
            When you isolate an electricity supply, there will be disruption. So, careful
            planning should precede isolation of circuits. For example, when isolating a section
            of a nursing home where elderly residents live, you will need to consult the
            nursing home staff, to consider all the possible consequences of isolation and to
            prepare a procedure.
            The following questions are useful:
            1	 How will the isolation affect the staff and other personnel? For example, think
               about loss of power to lifts, heating and other essential systems.
            2	 How could the isolation affect the residents and clients? For example, some
               residents may rely on oxygen, medical drips and ripple beds to aid circulation.

                                                                                                                                       59



9781398361591.indb 59                                                                                                                     01/08/22 11:21 AM

                                                 These critical systems usually have battery back-up facilities for short
                                                 durations.
                                              3	 How could the isolation affect the members of the public? For example, fire
                                                 alarms, nurse call systems, emergency lighting and other systems may stop
                                                 working.
                                              4	 How can an isolation affect systems? For example, IT programs and data
                                                 systems could be affected; timing devices could be disrupted. In this scenario,
                                                 you must make the employers, employees, clients, residents and members of
                                                 the public aware of the planned isolation.
                                              Alternative electrical back-up supplies may be required in the form of generators
                                              or uninterruptable power supply systems.

                                              Risks involved in isolation procedures
                                              Before any isolation is carried out, you must assess the risks involved. This section
                                              deals with the practical implications and the risks involved during the isolation
                                              procedure, if risk assessment and method statements are not followed.

                                              Who is at risk and why?
                                              If isolation is not carried out safely, what are the possible risks when performing
                                              inspection and testing tasks?

                                              Risks to you
                                              Risks to you might include:
                                              ●	 shock – touching a line conductor (e.g. if isolation is not secure)
                                              ●	 burns – resulting from touching a line conductor and earth, or arcing

                                              ●	 arcing – due to a short circuit between live conductors, or an earth fault

                                                 between a line conductor and earth
                                              ●	 explosion – arcing in certain environmental conditions (e.g. in the presence of

                                                 airborne dust particles or gases) may cause an explosion.
                                              Things that can cause risk to you include:
                                              ●	 inadequate information to enable safe or effective inspection and testing
                                                 (i.e. lack of diagrams, legends or charts)
                                              ●	 poor knowledge of the system you are working on (and so not meeting the

                                                 competence requirements of Regulation 16 of EAWR)
                                              ●	 insufficient risk assessment

                                              ●	 inadequate test instruments (not manufactured or maintained to the standards

                                                 of GS38).

                                              Risks to other tradespersons, customers and clients
                                              Risks to other tradespersons, customers and clients might include:
                                              ●	   switching off electrical circuits – for example, switching off a heating system
                                                   might cause hypothermia (resulting from being too cold); if lifts stop, people

            There might also be risk of loss of data and communications systems.


              ACTIVITY
              Write down a list of the risks associated with isolation and the effects isolation
              can have on people, livestock, systems and buildings. You could think about:
              l	 Who is at risk if inspection and testing is not carried out correctly?

              l	 What might happen if you need to switch off a socket-outlet circuit – for
                 example, in a hospital?
              l	 What must you do if you encounter a computer server that requires a
                 permanent supply and you need to switch off the main supply to enable safe
                 testing procedures?

                                                Generally, in electrical science and principles, large values are used, such as
                                                thousands of watts or millions of ohms. Other aspects of electrical work deal with
                                                tiny amounts, such as millionths of an ampere or thousandths of an ohm. This
                                                can become a problem in calculations, as errors may occur if the correct number
                                                of zeros is not entered into the calculator. Instead of inserting the actual number
                                                with lots of zeros, we use ‘to the power of ten’.
                                                The ‘power of’ numbers are given names that are explained in the table below.
                                                There is less chance of making an error using this method.

                                                   To learn the rules of transposition, you need to consider three types of formula:
                                                   l	 those that use addition and subtraction
                                                   l	 those that use multiplication and division
                                                   l	 those involving both (mixed formulae).

                                                   The following methods follow simplified mathematical rules and will give you the
                                                   ability to transpose any formulae you come across at Levels 2 and 3.

                                                       1	 The unknown you want to find must be on its own on one side of the equals
                                                          sign.
                                                       2	 The unknown should not have a minus sign in front of it.
                                                       3	 Any unknown that moves over the equals sign has the sign in front of it
                                                          changed from addition to subtraction or from subtraction to addition.
                                                       4	 Any unknown that does not have a sign (positive or negative) in front of it is
                                                          assumed to be positive.

                                                   Consider how to transpose this formula to find c.

                                                        a+b+c–d=e

                                                   The unknown c has a plus sign (+) in front of it so it stays where it is and the other
                                                   unknowns around it need to move. The unknowns a and e have no sign in front of
              ACTIVITY                             them so assume they are not being subtracted from anything.
              There are many                       So, to transpose it:

                                                   At all times, the equal sign acts as the centre of a set of balance scales and the
                                                   formula remains balanced (Figure 2.1). If numbers are substituted for the letters,
                                                   this might give:

            Transposing formulae involving multiplication
            and division
            Formulae involving division often include parts that are made up of letters and
            numbers written above and below a line, as fractions. The number above the line
            is called the numerator, and the number below is the denominator. A denominator
            is the number of parts a whole is divided into, a numerator is the number of these
            parts that we are dealing with. So, thinking of ¾ of a cake, the cake is divided into
            four equal parts, and we have three of them.

                    numerator =   number of parts we have
                   denominator number of equal parts in the whole


              The rules of transposition for multiplication and division
              1	 The unknown you want to find must be on its own on one side of the equals
                 sign.
              2	 The unknown to be found must be on its own, not part of a fraction.
              3	 Any unknown moved over the equal sign changes from top to bottom or
                 bottom to top.
              4	 Any unknown or number can be written as a fraction by writing it over a
                 denominator of 1, for example, 4 = 4/1.

            Move (a + b) over the equals sign, so:

            And:

            The (3 + 2) is treated as a single number (i.e. 5), so:

                                                    So if a rectangle had a length of 3 m and a width of 1.5 m, its area can be

            Density
            The density of a material is the mass divided by the volume, and is measured in
            kg/m3. Commonly, we use the known density of a material to calculate its mass in
            a given space.
            For example, water has a density of approximately 1000 kg per m3 at 25 °C.
            (Density changes with temperature.)
            Using this, we can calculate the mass of water in a tank by:
                 mass (kg) = density (kg/m3) × volume (m3)

            So, if we need to determine the mass of water in a tank measuring
            3 m × 2 m × 0.5 m, we calculate (remembering the density of water is
            1000 kg/m3):
                 mass (kg) = 1000 × 3 × 2 × 0.5 = 3000 kg

            p	Figure 2.8 The three sides of a right-angled triangle are: adjacent to the angle theta (θ), opposite
              the angle theta (θ) and the hypotenuse, which is opposite the right angle

            Consider this explanation to help you understand the relationships in
            trigonometry. Looking at a right-angled triangle, if any of the sides increase or
            decrease in length, the angle θ changes accordingly. (Unknown angles are often
            given the symbol theta, θ, from the Greek alphabet.)
            There are three formulae to remember when it comes to trigonometry.

                             opposite
                  sinθ =

                            adjacent


            Some people remember them by the mnemonic SOH CAH TOA.
            The sine, cosine and tangent ratios for the angle are calculated by using the
            relationships between the lengths of the sides. For example, the triangle shown in
            Figure 2.9 has the following dimensions:
                                                                                                                                            5m

            Using these values you can work out the sine, cosine and tangent values of the

              Assuming that the distance measured out is 20 m, the pole being used is 2 m
              long and the angle measured to the top of the building is 70°, the height of the
              building is found by using the formula:

                  tan θ = oa

              Transpose the formula:
                  tan θ × a = o
              Therefore, from the top of the pole, the height is:
                  tan 70° × 20 = 54.9 m
              The overall height (rounded up) is 57 m, once the pole length of 2 m is included.



            Statistics
            Statistics is the branch of mathematics that includes collecting, organising and
            interpreting data. In the electrotechnical sector, data may be used in situations
            such as:
            l	   cable selection tables
            l	   maximum permitted values of earth fault loop impedance
            l	   quotations and tendering
            l	   billing
            l	   quantity surveying
            l	   monitoring job progression.
            Statistics are best summarised in table form and can be presented as graphs.
            Below is an example of how data may be presented and analysed.

            From the data, it is clear that socket outlets are cheapest at Sockets
            R Us but, once discount is applied, ABC Supplies is best.
            Using computer spreadsheet programs, much of the analysis can be done quickly
            and automatically.

            Percentages
            A percentage (%) is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. For example, 35% is
            equal to 35 . A percentage is used to express one value or quantity as a fraction
                        100
            of another.
            Percentages are widely used in everyday life to work out things such as how much
            tax somebody pays or to show how much discount you will get off material at a
            wholesaler.

                                                EXAMPLE
                                                If you have to pay 20% of your earnings each month in tax, and you earn
                                                £1400.00 per month you can work out the amount of tax to pay by calculating:

                                                   1400 × 20 = 280 or £280.00
                                                     100

                                                A shorter way to do this is to show the percentage as a decimal
                                                multiplier, so 20% becomes 20 = 0.2

                                                so £1400.00 × 0.2 = £280.00
              Multipliers are often referred
              to as factors in publications     If you have to pay an extra 20% VAT on goods, and the goods cost £28.00
              such as BS 7671 and are           excluding VAT, you need to add 20% of £28.00 to the cost, so
              commonly used in circuit          28 × 20 = £5.60. So you need to add £5.60 to the ex-VAT price of
              design calculations. (See            100
              https://electrical.theiet.org)    £28.00, so the cost including VAT is £33.60.
                                                Once again, a shorter way to do this is to use a decimal multiplier. This time we
                                                need to add 20% so we use a multiplier of 1.2. This essentially adds 20% to the
                                                initial cost as it multiplies the value by 1, keeping the £28, and adds a further
              ACTIVITY                          0.2 representing the 20% increase.

            Wattmeters measure the power in a circuit, which is determined by the current
            and voltage. As a result, they are connected in parallel and series, allowing
            measurement of both properties.

            Unlike the meters above, ohmmeters must only be used when a circuit is not
            energised. Ohmmeters use a small internal current and voltage to determine
            resistance and must be connected in parallel to the given resistance, as

                                              3 BASIC MECHANICS
                                              Understanding basic mechanics will help you to link the mechanical properties
                                              and electrical quantities that enable electricity to be turned into a useful form
                                              of energy, linking physical work and electrical power. It may also help you to
                                              understand everyday objects, from seesaws to cranes and from claw hammers to
                                              wire cutters.

                                              Measuring mechanical loads
                                              It is important to understand the ways in which mechanical loads are measured.
                                              You need to understand the differences between mass and weight as well as
                                              energy and power. Energy and power can be mechanical as well as electrical.
                                              The fundamental relationship between the mass and the weight is defined by
                                              Newton’s Second Law and can be expressed as:

                                                   F = ma

                                              where:
                                              F = force (N)
                                              m = mass (kg)
                                              a = acceleration (m/s2).

                                              Weight
                                              Weight is the gravitational force acting on a body mass. Newton’s Second Law
                                              can be related to weight as a force due to gravity and can be expressed as:

                                                   W = mg

                                              where:
                                              W = weight (N)
                                              m = mass (kg)
                                              g = acceleration of gravity (on Earth this is 9.81 m/s2).

                                              Mass
                                              Mass is the comparison of an amount of material measured against a known
              KEY FACT                        value. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram. At the International Bureau of Weights
              There is no weight in           and Measures, located in Sevres, France, a 1 kg mass of platinum is retained as the
              space, just mass.               criterion for determining mass.
                                              As mass is determined by balancing one body against another, gravitational pull
                                              does not make any difference to the value. Mass is the same in outer space as it is
                                              on Earth.

            Acceleration
            Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time.

            levers

            could use a lever to move the Earth. Although it is not actually possible to lift the

                                               In a class 1 lever, the force and the load are on different sides of the fulcrum. The
                                               effectiveness of the force is affected by the distance of the point of application of
                                               the force from the fulcrum. You measure the torque by multiplying the force by its
                                               distance from the fulcrum. So, the greater the distance, the greater the effect of
                                               the force. In the example above, force applied downwards can be four times less
                                               than the load as the lever on the force (effort) side of the fulcrum is four times
                                               longer than the lever on the load side. Examples of class 1 levers are seesaws,
                                               crowbars and claw hammers when used to lift nails.

              KEY TERM                         The advantage gained by a lever is referred to as mechanical advantage (MA),
                                               which is calculated as:

                                               Class 2 levers
                                               In a class 2 lever, the load is between the point of effort and the fulcrum. The
                                               calculations remain the same, but the load is more limited because it is between
                                               the two points, and the effort and the desired movement are both in the same
                                               direction. An example of a class 2 lever is a wheelbarrow.

                                               In the example in Figure 2.22 above, the force of 100 N is applied at a distance of

              unaided human to lift.                           = force of effort × distance of effort from fulcrum
                                               So:
                                                     0.5 m × load = 2.5 m × 100 N

                                               To find the mechanical advantage:
                                                               load    500

                                               Therefore the mechanical advantage is 5.

            Pulleys
            A pulley is an effective way of gaining a mechanical advantage when lifting an
            object. By running a rope through a four-pulley system,
            a mechanical advantage of four is gained.

              EXAMPLE
              Determine the force required to raise the mass of 1000 kg.
                                                                                                                                           Force
              As load has been described as a mass, first determine the downward force of
              the load. So:

            Gears
            Gears are used to transmit torque from one rotating part to another. Gears are
            made of two or more cogwheels often having different diameters and therefore
            different numbers of teeth. Gears are used to change speed or effort needed to
            produce torque. For example, if a cog containing 20 teeth was connected to a cog
            containing 100 teeth and the smaller cog was driven by an electric motor rotating
            40 times a second, we can determine the rotations per second of the large cog by
            expressing the gear ratio. So:

            Other terms used to describe forces which act on a building structure are:

               tension or compression on a structure
            l	 horizontal forces: these act on the side of a building and can result in shear or

               torsion forces. Horizontal forces may be:
               l	 lateral – meaning acting across the width of the building

               l	 longitudinal – acting along the length of a building.



            Calculating quantities of mechanical loads
            Force
            Force can be defined as the strength or energy of physical action or movement. In
            practice, it can be any influence that causes an object with a mass to undergo a
            change in velocity, including any movement from rest, or a change in direction or
            geometrical construction (deformation).
            Simply, force is also the ‘weight’ an object has due to the force of gravity pulling it
            onto the ground beneath it.
            The SI unit for force, represented by the symbol F, is the newton (N). Since mass is
            measured in kilograms (kg) and acceleration is measured in metres per second per
            second (m/s2), then:

                  force in newtons = mass × acceleration, so F = ma (N)

                                                 The force exerted on a mass by gravity can be determined for a mass of 1 kg, as

              KEY FACT                            object:
              On Earth, acceleration                  F = 500 × 9.81 = 4905 N

                                                      F = 500 × 1 = 500 N


                                                 Work and energy
                                                 If force is applied to a body and that results in movement, then work has been
                                                 done. This applies to forces that lift or push objects or twist them.
                                                 When a force moves an object in the same direction as the force exerted, the
                        INDUSTRY TIP             work done is equal to the distance moved multiplied by the force exerted:
              Work is done when a force               work = force × distance

              to move. Lifting a glass full of   Or, to include the values used to determine force:

            Energy can exist in many forms but is categorised in two main groups:
            l	   kinetic energy, which is energy of motion, such as a rotating machine
            l	   potential energy, which is ‘stored’ energy due to gravity or in a spring.
            For example, the potential energy of gravity keeps a mass on the ground. If the mass
            is to be raised, then a machine uses kinetic energy. If the input of kinetic energy
            ceases, the potential energy tries to bring the mass back down to the ground.

            Power
            Power is defined as the rate of doing work – that is, work done divided by the
            time taken to carry out that work. The unit of power is joules per second (J/s),                     KEY FACT
            which is equivalent to a watt.                                                                       Power in watts is energy
                                                                                                                 divided by time. The

                    average power =              (measured in joules per second or watts)                        to complete a given
                                      time taken                                                                 task the more power is
                                                                                                                 needed.
              EXAMPLE
              The output (mechanical) power required for a motor to raise a mass of 1000 kg
              to a height of 5 m above the ground in 1 minute is calculated as:

                              mass × gravity × distance
                    power =
                                        time

              So:

                              1000 × 9.81 × 5
                    power =                   = 817.5 watts
                                    60

              If the same motor raised the same load in 10 seconds, the output power
              required by the motor would be:

                              mass × gravity × distance
                    power =
                                        time

              So:

                              1000 × 9.81 × 5
                    power =                   = 4905 watts
                                    10

              Although the same amount of energy is used, no matter how quickly the task is
              carried out, the power required to do the work more quickly is increased due to
              the shorter time.

            The atoms that make up different materials have different numbers of electrons.
            In the steady state an atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons, and this
            leaves the atom electrically neutral.
            Atoms in solids and liquids are more tightly bound together than those in gases.
            Figure 2.28 shows the simplified structure of copper, which is often used to conduct                                       Cu

            three-dimensional. Where there are two or more electrons orbiting a nucleus, their

              Electrons orbit the              Random free electrons can be configured if the conducting material is connected
              nucleus of an atom.              to a battery. The free electrons are attracted to the positive plate and repelled
              Electricity is the flow of       by the negative plate. This causes the electrons to drift, in a conducting material,
              these electrons as               from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal. As positive ions
              they move from atom              are unable to drift in solids, every time an electron leaves the negative terminal,
              to atom. Electron is the
              Greek word for amber.            one enters the positive terminal. This flow of electrons is electric current.
              Amber is a material that
              is easily electrified by
              static. Rubbing wool
              on amber can charge
              the amber, which can
              then release an electric
              charge when held against
              another material or
              person.


              KEY TERM
              Closed circuit: a complete
              circuit connected to
              a source of energy. If
              the circuit contains a           p	 Figure 2.30 Electrons are attracted in one direction when a source of energy is connected to the
              switch and the switch is            material
              switched off, it becomes
              an open circuit.                 In order for electric current to flow, there must be a closed circuit. Once the
                                               circuit is opened, the drift of electrons is immediately stopped and the current
                                               flow ceases.

              in this chapter.                 As electron flow is electrical current and current is measured in amperes (A), how
                                               is one converted to the other?
                                               French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736–1806) determined that 1
                                               coulomb of charge is equal to 6.24 × 1018 electrons. That is equal to
                                               6 240 000 000 000 000 000 electrons! So if that many electrons flowed through
                                               a material such as copper and past an electron counter, that would be equal to
                                               1 coulomb. He also determined that if the drift of electrons was at a rate of 1
                                               coulomb per second, the resulting current would be 1 ampere.

                        INDUSTRY TIP           The makeup of individual cables varies according to the application for which they
              Single-core cables (singles)     are to be used. The construction and material are determined by three main factors:
              must always be installed in a    l	 working voltage, which determines the thickness of the insulation
              containment system such as       l	 current-carrying capacity, which determines the cross-sectional area of the
              conduit or trunking. The only       conductor(s)
              exception is for earthing and    l	 environmental conditions – such as requirement for mechanical protection,
              bonding conductors.                 temperature, water and chemical protection – which ultimately determine the
                                                  form and composition of the outer protective sheath.
              ACTIVITY                         The current-carrying conductors of an electricity cable are normally made of
              Have you ever wondered           copper or sometimes aluminium, either of stranded or solid construction.
              why cable sizes are as
              they are? Why don’t they
              go up in even steps?             Resistance and resistivity
              Discuss this with a partner.     As we have seen, the flow of electric current in a material is related to its atomic
                                               structure and the freedom of electrons to move. Where the freedom of electrons
                                               to move is high, the material will act as a good conductor of electricity when an
              KEY TERM                         external voltage if applied. However, where a material’s atomic structure is such
              Negligible: small or             that there is minimal electron movement, there will be negligible current flow
              unimportant and                  and the material will act as an insulator.
              therefore not worth
              considering.                     Resistance in an electrical circuit is encountered in two forms: continuity
                                               resistance (in conductors) and insulation resistance (in insulators).

            Continuity resistance of a conductor
            This is the end-to-end resistance of an electrical conductor or the resistance
            between two points in an electrical circuit. In the case of an electrical conductor,
            the continuity resistance needs to be as low as possible to enable the maximum
            amount of current to flow through the conductor. Continuity resistance is
            generally measured on an ohmmeter. Measured values can be very small and
            therefore may be quoted in milliohms (mΩ).
            The resistance of a conductor is based on a number of variable factors:
            l	 type of conductor
            l	 physical dimensions
            l	 temperature.

            In order to understand the resistance of a conductor, it is necessary to be aware of
            these factors.
            During the design and any inspection and testing of an electrical installation it is
            always important to keep these factors in mind.
            Designers will factor in temperature increases for conductors because the
            temperature of a conductor under load will increase, resulting in increased
            conductor resistance.
            Inspectors, while testing circuit resistances under no-load conditions, need to
            understand that the actual resistance will be greater when the circuit is carrying a
            full load current. They will need to factor in the temperature increases.

            Effects of physical dimensions: length
            If a cube of conducting material, with a resistance between two opposite faces of
            R ohms, is joined in a line of equal cubes, then the overall resistance is that of all                        INDUSTRY TIP

                                               If R = 2 Ω, 7R = 14 Ω.
                                               If the resistors have different values, they are still added together.
                                               If R1 = 2 Ω, R2 = 3 Ω, R3 = 4 Ω, R4 = 6 Ω, R5 = 9 Ω, R6 = 3 Ω, R7 = 1 Ω, then:

                                              As conductors in cables are generally the same diameter throughout their length,
                                              each metre of cable is like one of the cubes in the diagram above. The longer the
                                              conductor, the higher the resistance.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If a conductor in a cable has a resistance of 0.01 Ω per metre (Ω/m),
                                               calculate the resistance of 120 m.
                                               As the total resistance (Rt) = Ω/m × length, then 0.01 × 120 = 1.2 Ω


                                              Effects of physical dimensions: cross-sectional area
                                              If a pipe had a cross-sectional area of 150 mm2 and water was poured into it, the
                                              flow of water would be restricted by the cross-sectional area of the pipe as only so
                                              much water could pass through it at one time. If the pipe diameter was increased
                                              so that the cross-sectional area was 300 mm2, twice the amount of water would
                                              be able to flow. Current flowing through a cable is much the same. The smaller the
                                              cross-sectional area of a conductor, the greater the resistance. If the cross-sectional
                                              area is increased, the resistance decreases proportionally. This effect is the same as
                                              having resistances in parallel, which is covered on page 103.
                                              By increasing the cross-sectional area by a factor of 4, the resistance is reduced
                                              accordingly.

              for 1 km of the same cable, assuming the temperature remains constant.                            size it is two times (× 2)
              1 km = 1000 m                                                                                     as large. If it halves in
                                                                                                                size it is divided by two
              Therefore, if the resistance of 100 m = 0.3 Ω:
                                                                                                                (÷ 2).
              the resistance of 1000 m = 10 × the resistance of 100 m = 10 × 0.3 = 3 Ω
              If the cross-sectional area of the cable is doubled in size, the resistance would
              halve, so:
                        3Ω
                  	        = 1.5 Ω

            Cable manufacturers’ data provides resistance values for cable conductors
            according to the conductor material and cross-sectional area, usually expressed
            in mΩ/m at a specified temperature. If the end-to-end cable length is known, the
            end-to-end resistance can then be calculated.

            Insulation resistance
            This is the resistance measured across the electrical insulation surrounding a
            conductor, from the outside of the cable through to the conductor or through the                            INDUSTRY TIP

            the measured value will invariably be very high, the pointer is likely to swing full
            scale to the ∞ (infinity) mark. This does not mean that the insulation resistance is
            infinity! The measurement is beyond the scale range of that particular instrument

            marked scale value or maximum of scale range if known – for example, > 99 MΩ
            (greater than 99 MΩ).

                                                This proportionality is equal to the resistance (R) of the conductor. Therefore V = I
                                                × R, which is generally written as V = IR.

                                                This gives the potential difference (V ), given the current and resistance.

                                                This gives the reciprocal of the total resistance, so turn both sides of the
                                                equations upside down.

                                                   R total = 30 = 0.967Ω

                                                Alternatively, you can use the button marked on a calculator as  x –1 and apply:
                                                2  x –1 + 3  x –1 + 5  x –1 =  x –1 = and the answer should be 0.967 Ω.
                                                Always remember to push the final  x –1 to get the true value.
                                                To calculate the voltage across the supply terminals, use:

                                                As the voltage in a parallel circuit is common, the voltage drop across each
                                                resistor is 2 V.

            Power in basic electrical circuits
            It is known that if a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points, then
            1 joule of energy is used in moving 1 coulomb of charge between the points.
            Therefore:

                  1 joule = 1 coulomb × 1 volt or W = QV

            We also know that power is energy used over a period of time. In electrical circuits
            we also determine power using the amount of potential difference and current. So:                          INDUSTRY TIP

                                                                                                               is the same in each resistor.
            Where:                                                                                             In a parallel circuit, the

            Also, as voltage can be determined using Ohm’s law, by multiplying the voltage
            and resistance, then:

                  P = (IR)I = I 2R

            Power loss or consumption is proportional to the square of the current flow, I2.
            Thus, assuming a constant resistance in a circuit, if the current doubles (due to a
            corresponding increase in voltage) there will be a four-fold increase in power.
            Also, as:


                   I = V and P = V × I
                       R

            Then:

            Note that these formulae are not complete for AC circuits as a power factor needs to
            be taken into account. Power factors will be covered in detail in Book 2, Chapter 2.
            So, using the derived formula, the following calculations are possible.

                                              Voltage drop
                                              The flow of electric current through a conductor results in a drop in electrical
                                              pressure (voltage), referred to as voltage drop or volt drop, due to the resistance
                                              to the current flow presented by the conductor resistance. This loss of voltage
                                              represents a loss of energy, which is reflected in the generation of heat.
                                              The voltage drop is determined by the amount of current flowing in a conductor
                                              and the resistance of that conductor. It is calculated from the product of the current
                                              flowing, measured in amperes (A), and the conductor resistance, measured in ohms
                                              (Ω), which is simply Ohm’s law.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If a circuit had a total conductor resistance of 0.5 Ω and the load at the end of
                                               the circuit had a current demand of 15 A, the voltage drop in the circuit would be:
                                                   0.5 Ω × 15 A = 7.5 V
                                               So if the supply voltage at the origin of the circuit was 230 V, the voltage at the
                                               load would be:

            If voltage drop is excessive, there may not be enough voltage at the end of the
            circuit for the load to operate correctly. In order to reduce the amount of voltage
            drop, the cable resistance must be reduced. This can be done by increasing the
            cross-sectional area of the circuit conductor.

            Effects of electric current
            The three main effects of electrical current (similar to sources of electricity) are:
            l	 thermal (heating)
            l	 chemical

            l	 magnetism.

            In this section we deal with the thermal and chemical effects. Magnetism is
            covered in detail in the following section (page 108).

            Thermal (heating)
            When current flows in a wire, apart from the flow of electrons, there is a thermal
            effect; the wire starts to heat up. The amount it heats up depends on factors
            such as the cross-sectional area of the wire, the amount of current flowing and
            the material that the wire is made of. The heating effect of electricity is used in
            electric fires and other heaters. Variations of this heat effect are used to make
            light from light-bulb (lamp) filaments, which give off large amounts of light as
            they glow white hot as a result of the current passing through the thin filament.

                                                     It is usual to indicate current flow in a conductor because there is a three-

                                                     checked with a compass needle. When current flows away from the viewer, the
                                                     magnetic field rotates clockwise. When current flows towards the viewer, the
                                                     magnetic field rotates anticlockwise. The magnetic field rotates in the same way
                                                     as a screw: clockwise to tighten the screw (forcing it away), anticlockwise to undo
                                                     it (drawing it closer).
                                                     The strength of the magnetic flux is proportional to the current flowing through
                                                     the conductor. The more current flowing, the stronger the magnetic field will be.
                                                     Placing two conductors together changes the effects. If two conductors are
                                                     placed together in a conduit, for example, with the current flowing in opposite
                                                     directions, there is a cancelling effect between the opposing magnetic fields, as
                                                     long as the magnetic fields are of equal strength. This arrangement is therefore
                                                     adopted in electrical installations. Magnetic fields can cause problems in electrical
                                                     installations and therefore need to be cancelled and minimised as far as is
                                                     reasonably practicable.

            Solenoids
            The strength of a magnetic field is proportional to the current flowing through
            the conductor. Even with high currents passing through the conductors, the field
            produced is relatively weak, in terms of useful magnetism. To obtain a stronger
            magnetic field a number of conductors can be added by turning or winding the
            cable.
            The most common form of this is the solenoid, which consists of one long insulated
            conductor wound to form a coil. The winding of the coil causes the magnetic fields
            to merge into a stronger field similar to that of a permanent bar magnet. The
            strength of the field depends on the current and the number of turns.

            Force on a current-carrying conductor
            If a current-carrying conductor is suspended in a magnetic field, the field induced
            by the current in the conductor reacts with the main magnetic field. This reaction
            of the two fields creates a force which moves the suspended conductor. The
            amount of force acting on the conductor is determined by:

                    F = βLI

            where:
            F = force acting on the conductor, in newtons (N)
            β = magnetic flux density, in teslas (T), of the main field
            L = the length of the conductor within the main magnetic field (m)
            I = the current passing through the conductor (A).

              EXAMPLE
              A conductor 0.5 m in length is placed in a magnetic field having a density of
              0.5 teslas. If 10 A is passed through the cable, determine the force acting on
              the cable.
                    F = βLI
              So:
                    F = 0.5 × 0.5 × 10 = 2.5 N

                                              waveform outputs
                                              Alternators use rotating magnets to generate electricity. When the magnetic
                                              field cuts through the conductor, which is wound on iron cores in the stator, an
                                              electromotive force (e.m.f.) is produced and current is induced in the conductor.

              uses an alternator to
              charge the batteries. Can

                                              Calculating magnitudes of a generated e.m.f.
                                              If you were to experiment with the electromagnetic induction apparatus shown in
                                              Figure 2.53, you would find that when the magnet is changed for a stronger one,
                                              the flux increases, and a greater e.m.f. is generated, indicated by greater deflection
                                              on the voltmeter. Furthermore, if the conductor can be doubled up by winding it
                                              into a coil, the deflection on the meter will be twice that for a single conductor.
                                              Speeding up the crossing of the magnetic field by the conductor also causes a
                                              greater deflection. The following formula can be deduced from these three effects:

                                                   Ε = βlv

                                              where:
                                              Ε = induced e.m.f., in volts (V)
                                              β = flux density of the magnetic field, in teslas (T)
                                              l = the length of the conductor in the magnetic field, in metres (m)
                                              v = velocity, in metres per second (m/s).

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If a conductor of length 0.1 m cuts a magnetic field of 1.2 T at a velocity of 15
                                               m/s, the generated e.m.f. is calculated as follows:
                                                   Ε = βlv = 1.2 × 0.1 × 15 = 1.8 V
                                               If the conductor is twice the length (0.2 m), the e.m.f. is:
                                                   Ε = βlv = 1.2 × 0.2 × 15 = 3.6 V

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If a battery of 12 V gives a current of 5 A for 10 minutes, the amount of energy
                                               provided over the 10-minute period is calculated as follows.
                                               To find total energy: W = Q × V
                                               Total charge transferred:
                                                   Q	= It = 5 × (10 × 60) C

                                                   Q	 = 3000 C

                                                   W	= Q × V = 3000 × 12

                                                   W	= 36 000 J or 36 kJ

                                              The principle is used in thermocouples, which are used to sense temperature. The
                                              amount of electricity generated is in proportion to the temperature.
                                              In some waste disposal plants where waste is burned, this effect is used to

                                              The characteristic of AC is its oscillating waveform, referred to as a ‘sine wave’.

              and forth in a regular
              pattern.                        In practice, the AC supply at a workplace is unlikely to have a waveform that is a
                                              pure sine wave because of harmonics (contamination) arising from the connected
                                              loads. This will result in distortion of the waveform shape. The shape of the
                                              waveform of an AC supply may be displayed on an oscilloscope.
                                              Because of its oscillating nature, alternating current and its associated voltage
                                              have additional factors that must be considered in describing the nature of the
                                              supply. These include the frequency of oscillation and the ‘effective’ current and
                                              voltage, whose values are continuously changing with time.

            The output of an AC system, when measured and tracked, is usually referred to as
            a waveform.
            As the rotating machine induces voltage, the value rises to a peak, falls to zero,
            then falls to a peak negative value, and then rises back to zero.
            This single waveform represents one full turn of the alternator.
            In Figure 2.54 the sinusoidal waveform is produced as the rotating conductor
            cuts the magnetic field set up by the permanent magnet (left). As the conductor                                            INDUSTRY TIP

               point is periodic time (t ), shown on the waveform from the first position 1 to the second position 1

            As the conductor in the diagram above starts at position 1, the direction of
            motion is in line with the field. Therefore no flux is crossed and no e.m.f. is
            induced.
            As the conductor rotates, the number of lines of flux increases together with the
            angle at which the conductor cuts the flux lines, until the maximum value of
            e.m.f. is produced at position 3. As the conductor moves from position 3 to 5, the
            e.m.f. decreases to zero, at which point the conductor cuts no magnetic flux lines
            because it moves in the same direction as the flux. As the conductor rotates from
            position 5 to 7, the induced e.m.f. increases, reaching its peak value because the
            conductor is cutting the maximum number of flux lines at right angles. This time
            the polarity is reversed, and reaches the negative peak value. As the conductor
            rotates back to position 1, the number of flux lines cut is reduced, so that the
            output decreases to zero.

                                              This waveform is a sine wave in which the instantaneous voltage v (the voltage at

                                              Using UK frequencies, AC values change at a rate of 50 Hz, which means that the

            operating at 132 kV, 66 kV, 33 kV and 11 kV, there are also four high-voltage
            transmission networks operating at 400 kV (super grid) and 275 kV (the grid) in
            the UK. The 400 kV network was installed in the 1960s to strengthen the 275 kV
            system which began operating in 1953. The 400 kV network has three times the
            power carrying capacity of one 275 kV line and eighteen times the capacity of a
            132 kV line.
            Primary distribution by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) is usually
            carried out at 132 kV, using double circuit steel tower lines feeding primary
            substations, which in turn feed supplies at either 66 kV or 33 kV. The purpose
            of these primary substations is to supply larger industrial installations and the
            secondary distribution networks in urban and rural areas. Secondary distribution
            networks carry supplies from the primary substations via overhead lines on
            wooden poles or underground cables. Customers are connected at low voltage
            230–400 V single or three phase.

            Interconnected capacity
            Interconnectors between Europe and the UK provide a pooling of capacity and
            diversity of supplies between the UK and Europe. This is provided by High Voltage
            Direct Current (HVDC) which is a way of conveying electricity over very long
            distances with fewer transmission losses than an equivalent HVAC solution. It
            also provides greater control over the transmission of electricity, including ability
            to change size and direction of power flow. Direct current supplies are usually
            obtained from AC mains supplies, first by using a transformer to change to the
            required voltage and secondly by using a rectifier to convert the AC supply to DC.
            Unfortunately, the rectification process is not perfect and some superimposed
            ripple is likely to appear on the DC output.                                                               INDUSTRY TIP

            A small proportion of the UK’s electricity is already generated from renewable
            sources but, with concerns about the depletion of fossil fuels, this is expected to
            grow significantly in the next few years.
            Other ways that electricity can be generated are:
            l	 solar photovoltaic cells (PV) – these convert sunlight into electricity and
               although the PV concept is associated with small PV panels on domestic and
               commercial premises, many large PV power stations have been installed with
               hundreds of MW being produced
            l	 combined heat and power (CHP) including micro CHP – in conventional

               power stations the waste heat is normally discarded via large cooling towers,
               whereas in a CHP generation system the waste heat or thermal energy is
               captured and used for heating schemes or production processes
            l	 batteries and cells – when two different metals are placed in a chemical

               solution, or electrolyte, ions are drawn towards one metal and electrons to the
               other. This is called a cell and produces electricity. Many cells joined together
               are called batteries.

            Source and arrangements of supply
            A number of different electricity supply systems may be used in work premises,
            catering for specific requirements. These may be DC or AC operating at different
            voltages, and in the case of AC the supply may be single- or three-phase.
            Direct current is not used for public electricity supplies (with the exception of
            the links between England, Netherlands, Ireland and France) but has some work
            applications, such as battery-operated works plant (fork lift trucks, etc.). Certain
            parts of the UK railway system, in particular the London Underground and
            services in Southern England, also use DC for traction supplies.

                                              Alternating current is the distribution system of choice for electricity suppliers
                                              all over the world. The main reason is its versatility. Using an AC supply permits
                                              wider scope concerning circuit arrangements and supply voltages, through the use
                                              of transformers, which enable the supply voltage to be changed up or down.
                                              These different types of AC supply systems will now be explained.

                         INDUSTRY TIP         a single-phase supply. This is the arrangement provided for domestic premises, as
                                              well as for many supplies within work premises (lighting, socket outlets, etc.). The

              with a two-phase and neutral
              supply. This is not to supply   on the public supply system and therefore the voltage of the neutral conductor,

                                              The use of alternating current, rather than direct current, gives more scope for

                                              Transformers are fundamental to the safe and efficient use of electricity. They

                                              If an AC supply is applied to one coil (known as the primary), the magnetic flux

                                              Transformers are very efficient devices, particularly when working on full load and,

            Types of transformers
            There are a wide range of electrical transformers all designed for different uses
            and purposes. The designs may differ but the fundamental principles are the same.

            Power transformers
            Power transformers are the most common type of transformer and are used as:
            l	 step-up transformers in the transmission of electrical energy from power
               stations (25 kV–400 kV) and step down from 400 kV to 132 kV
            l	 step-down transformers in distribution substations from

               132 kV–11 kV, and 11 kV to 400 V for use in commercial and domestic
               situations
            l	 step-down transformers to convert mains voltage 230 V to extra-low voltage

               to power electronic equipment.
            The construction of insulated laminations minimises the eddy current produced
            during the transformation process.
            For large power transformers used at generating and distribution substations, oil is
            used as a coolant and insulating medium. For small-rating transformers, the oil is
            circulated through ducts in the coil assembly and through cooling fins fixed to the
            body of the transformer tank. In higher ratings, the oil circulates through separate
            air-cooled radiators that may use pumps and fans to aid the cooling process.
            Cast resin power transformers, where the windings are encased in epoxy resin, are
            often used where there is a fire risk in indoor situations.

                                              Current transformers (CTs) have many uses. Those that involve metering require
                                              extremely accurate current transformers, such as Class X CTs.

              Current transformers are
              used to measure the current
              demand for an installation or
              circuit, and are often found
              around bus bar systems or                                                                                           Primary

                                              ensure electrical separation from the primary supply, usually for safety purposes.
                                              These transformers have additional insulation and electrostatic shielding. In some
                                              cases, one or both sides of the transformer remains separated from earth by a

                                              A common use for isolation transformers is the domestic shaver socket

                                              touching live parts. Because the parts are isolated and the current cannot flow
                                              back to its origin (the secondary side of the transformer) via the earth path,

              and, given a fixed frequency,
              are normally considered to
              be constant. Copper losses
              occur in the windings and are
              proportional to the square of
              the load current.

                                              Another type of loss is hysteresis loss. This is due to the transformer core being
                                              magnetised in one direction, then re-magnetised in the other direction as the
                                              supply alternates. If the material requires energy to re-magnetise it, this also

                                              reduces hysteresis loss.
                                              Further losses in transformers are copper losses. This is a loss due to the heating
                                              effect of current passing through the windings. The windings are resistances and
                                              as in any resistance, the power dissipated, or lost, is usually determined as I 2R.

            Inductance
            There are two types of inductance in relation to transformers: self-inductance and
            mutual-inductance.
            Self-inductance is where a transformer winding induces a magnetic field that
            rotates around the core and induces a current back into the winding, limiting
            current flow. This principle is used in choke/ballast units in fluorescent luminaires.
            Mutual-inductance is where a primary winding induces a magnetic field that
            induces a current into a second winding, as in current and voltage transformers.

            Relationship of e.m.f. produced and
            number of turns
            The proportion of e.m.f. produced is related to the number of turns on the primary
            coil with respect to the secondary coil. This relationship can be determined by:

                   E1        N1
                         =
                   E2        N2


            where:
            E1 = e.m.f. induced in the primary (V1)
            E2 = e.m.f. induced in the secondary (V2)                                                                   INDUSTRY TIP
            N1 = number of primary turns
            N2 = number of secondary turns.                                                                     When working out transformer
                                                                                                                ratios, use the winding to

                                              A reasonable assumption is that:

                                                     E1       V1

                                              Therefore:

                                              The ratio of primary turns to secondary is referred to as the turns ratio,
                                              represented by:

                                               secondary. Suppose that 230 V AC is applied to the primary winding. Calculate
                                               the output voltage.
                                                     V1       N1
                                                          =

            Transformer power ratings
            As a transformer is not a load, simply a method of changing voltage and current,
            it is rated in kVA. This is because certain loads may include a power factor,
            which can increase the current demand by the load. As a result, the rating of the
            transformer is given in volt amperes (VA) instead of kilowatts (kW). So when
            selecting a transformer for a particular load, the actual current drawn by the load
            must be multiplied by the voltage.

            USED IN ELECTROTECHNICAL
            SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT
            The function of electronic
            components in electrical systems
            Most electronic systems use many different electrical components in their power
            supply and in their operational systems.
            Security alarm systems use full-wave rectification and smoothing through
            capacitors to supply a 12 V operating system. In addition, the closed-loop
            system uses transistor and similar technology to convert low-level signals from
            components such as passive infrared (PIR) detectors into an alarm output signal to
            components that operate the alarm.
            Thyristors or SCRs are used extensively in motor speed control, circuits for heating
            and other applications, where motors and pumps require variable output. The
            ability to control an output waveform is essential in controlling the motor speed.
            Heating control systems use a number of components. The most important
            element of any form of heating control is probably the ability to sense
            temperature in the airspace or water systems that are being heated.
            A thermistor is used to determine accurately the temperature of the space or
            heating medium. The heating control system then uses feedback from the sensor                   	 Figure 2.69 A range of different

            Diacs
            A diac is a junction of two zener diodes, with two terminals. It works on AC
            circuits, hence the name diode for AC. A diac will not allow current flow unless a                                          Diac
            pre-set voltage is reached. Once this voltage is reached, current can flow in both
            directions. Current will continue to flow until the voltage falls below the level set,            	 Figure 2.73 Symbol for a diac
            at which point the diac restricts current flow.

            Thyristors
            A thyristor is a solid-state switch that allows current flow between two of its
            terminals if a small current is sensed on the third. There are two types: silicon-
            controlled rectifiers (SCR) and triacs.

            SCRs
            The SCR is similar to the diode, in that current can only flow between the anode
            and cathode in one direction. However, it also has a gate terminal, which activates
            the switch when a small current is sensed on that terminal. Essentially, it allows
            a large current to be controlled by a small current. The SCR will continue to allow
            current flow between anode and cathode until the gate current is stopped. It
            does not require a constant gate terminal current, except when allowing the main
            current to pass.

            Triacs
            A triac has three terminals, one called the gate. If the gate senses a very small
            control current, AC is allowed to flow between the other two main terminals                                                Triac
            (known as MT1 and MT2). If the gate current is removed, the device will stop
            current flow when the alternating cycle reaches 0 V.

            Transistors
            The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronics and the
            reason why electronic systems are now so affordable.                                                ACTIVITY

            The three terminals on a bipolar transistor are known as base (B), collector (C) and                the trigger angle have on
            emitter (E).                                                                                        a triac?
            A transistor may be used either as a switch or an amplifier. When the base of an
            NPN transistor is grounded (0 V), no current flows between emitter and collector,
            so the transistor is off. If the base voltage is increased above 0.6 V, a current will
            flow from emitter to collector and the transistor is on. If the base current varies in
            value, the emitter to collector current will follow this pattern of variation with a                                    Transistor
            larger or smaller current flow; in this situation, the transistor acts as an amplifier.

                                              Another type of transistor is the field effect transistor (FET), which has terminals
                                              marked gate, source and drain. The FET is much cheaper to produce as it requires
                                              less silicon. It also has the major advantage of operating at virtually no current on
                                              the gate terminal as long as a voltage above 0.6 V is present.

            Thermistors
            A thermistor is a type of resistor in which the resistance varies
            significantly with temperature. This variation is so well defined that there                 Resistance
            is a definite temperature-related use for them. Thermistors typically                         (ohms)
            achieve high precision within a limited temperature range, typically −90 °C
            to 130 °C.

                                              Capacitors are widely used in electrical circuits in many common electrical
                                 Capacitor    devices. A capacitor is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store
                                              energy electrostatically in an electric field, rather than by chemical reaction, as in

               capacitor                      has now been widely superceded.)
                                              Capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors

            Half-wave rectification
            In half-wave rectification of a single-phase supply, either the positive or negative
            half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Half-wave
            rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-
            phase supply.
            As only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, the mean voltage is
            lower than full-wave rectification.

            Full-wave rectification
            A full-wave rectifier converts the whole of the input, both positive and negative
            components of the waveform, to one of constant polarity at its output. Full-wave
            rectification output gives a pulsating DC waveform with a higher average output
            voltage than its half-wave counterpart.
            The unit works with two diodes and a centre-tapped transformer, or four diodes in
            a bridge configuration, as shown in Figure 2.85 on the next page.

                                              When installing smart systems, it is important to recognise, check and where
                                              required, update the following:
                                              l	 Firmware – this is the equipment’s permanent internal software that is
                                                 designed to operate the equipment.
                                              l	 App control – ‘app’ is short for ‘application’ and is the software used to control

                                                 a device. Manufacturers of smart equipment develop their own apps which
                                                 are often only compatible with their own devices. Third-party developed apps
                                                 can often control an array of equipment from different manufacturers. For
                                                 example, a homeowner may have several types of smart-plug, but might wish
                                                 to control them using either one app, or by using one voice control smart
                                                 device such as Alexa, Google Nest or Siri.
                                              l	 End of Life Agreement (EoL) – manufacturers will update their firmware and

                                                 app control software to support smart equipment and allow it to continue
                                                 to be compatible and function, even when the tablet or smartphone’s own
                                                 operating system is updated. At some point, the manufacturer will stop this
                                                 support as other, newer equipment supersedes older technology. This becomes
                                                 an ‘end of life’ of the equipment.

               INTRODUCTION
               Large amounts of information need to be absorbed and understood by everyone within the construction
               industry. Most of this information is guidance or commentary on Regulations. However, there are also laws
               covering electrical work and the way it is carried out that need to be obeyed.
               The law will be satisfied if the installer complies with various documents, including BS 7671:2018 (2022) The
               IET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition amendment 2, the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) Guidance
               Notes and other related guidance. The first part of this chapter will help you to identify the relevant duties set
               out in statute law and commercial contract law (civil law) and to know how to carry out those duties.
               The rest of the chapter deals with technical considerations of working in the electrical industry.

            1 REGULATIONS RELATED TO
            ELECTRICAL ACTIVITIES
            In Chapter 1, we looked at the many Statutory and Non-statutory Regulations,
            Guidance material and Codes of Practice relating to working in the construction
            industry. Below is a reminder of some of those Regulations and other documents
            relating specifically to electrical installation work.

            Statutory regulations
            A Statutory Regulation is easily distinguishable from other regulations because its
            full title usually contains the word ‘Regulations’ and always has an SI (Statutory
            Instrument) number. Statutes (Acts of Parliament) are known as primary
            legislation. They lay down the general framework of the law, which is added to
            over the years through numerous Regulations. Statutory Regulations are known as
            secondary legislation.

            Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
            The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSW Act) is the primary legislation
            covering occupational health and safety in Great Britain. This Act has been
            amended over the years by various pieces of legislation to enforce health and                 INDUSTRY TIP
            safety law in Great Britain.

              Nanotechnology is
              widely used in medical          In order to reduce the exposure of workers to hazardous substances, employers
              applications but may            are required to do the following:
              also be found in everyday
                                              l	   Identify the health hazards – using information about any chemicals or
              products such as
              sunscreen, cosmetics                 substances used in the workplace that might be a hazard.
              and paints, finishes            l	   Decide how to prevent harm to health – using risk assessments to
              and surface coatings on              determine who may be harmed by a chemical or substance and how someone
              everyday products.                   might be harmed.
                                              l	   Provide control measures to reduce harm to health – looking at the
              KEY TERM                             potential for harm and introducing protection measures, such as local exhaust

              suffering asphyxia, they             are informed of the risks associated with a hazard, what the protective

                                              l	   Keep all control measures in good working order – all measures must
                                                   function correctly and any failing or potential failing must be reported and
                                                   rectified. Equipment that is not in good working order must be taken out of

                                              l	   Provide information, instruction and training for employees and others –
                                                   this is vitally important to ensure that those who work with or are potentially
                                                   exposed to harmful substances understand what they are being exposed to,
                                                   know what to do to prevent a situation getting out of control and becoming an
                                                   emergency, and know how to deal with particular situations or emergencies.

                                              Statutory Regulations cover the whole range of areas dealt with by the law. Each
                                              set of regulations lays down the detailed requirements that have to be met to
                                              comply with a specific Act of Parliament. In construction-related industries, most
                                              legislation focuses on health and safety.
                                              Statutory Regulations place specific requirements on duty holders to do
                                              something, provide something or declare something.

                                              giving notice.
                                              On a routine visit, rather than responding to a complaint or particular incident,
                                              inspectors inspect the workplace, work activities, and methods and procedures

            In general, employers are responsible for the actions of their employees and,
            where these result in breaches in legislation or accidents, it is the employer that is
            punished. However, where a breach is entirely due to an employee, the employer
            has the right to impose its own disciplinary processes, which, at worst, may result
            in a finding of gross misconduct and dismissal.

            Breaches of Non-statutory Regulations
            Breaches of Non-statutory Regulations, such as British Standards (BSs) and
            supporting guidance, usually amount to a breach of contract and often revolve
            around quality. Contractual requirements for the provision of services or standards
            usually exceed any legal requirements. When requirements have been breached,
            financial compensation for damages is often sought.
            In Figure 3.5, showing the hierarchy of work-related legislation and guidance, it
            might appear that British Standards and Guidance documents are less important                  INDUSTRY TIP
            than Statutory Regulations. However, the best practices contained in these
                                                                                                     Best practice that includes
            examples of non-statutory documents are actually used as benchmarks in

            Even if a breach of non-statutory regulations is not a legal issue, the consequences
            can be far-reaching. The industry may lose faith in the offending organisation’s         KEY TERM

                                                There are many different sources of technical information available, including
                                                reference books, textbooks and commentaries, to help you interpret different
                                                elements of electrical engineering. They are aimed at different levels, from the
                                                trainee to the experienced engineer. It is important to recognise the different
                                                types and levels of information available so that it can be used to best effect.
                                                In addition to industry information, guidance and documentation, technical
                                                information needed to carry out installation work can also be contained in the
                                                form of drawings and specifications.

                                                Sources of technical information

            presentation, viewers can send queries to the organiser, which are then dealt with
            by the speaker in a short question-and-answer session. Webinars are often left

                                              Most professional institutions provide support and publish technical information
                                              for their members. This type of information has usually been accumulated over
                                              many years by practitioners in the industry and then put together by respected
                                              members of the institution, so it is full of useful technical advice.
                                              Some institutions give general advice on design or installations – for example,
                                              the Plumbing Engineering Services Design Guide from the Chartered Institute of

                                              Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) guides.
                                              Other institutions focus on particular elements of electrotechnical engineering,
                                              providing technical solutions to particular tasks or advice on developing specific
                                              systems of work. They include application manuals and guidance publications – for

                                              and publishers who provide commentary and guidance on BS 7671.

                                              Types of drawings
                                              Numerous sets of drawings are produced to communicate information about
                                              individual systems or collections of systems within a project. They include:
                                              l	 plans or layout drawings
                                              l	 schematic (block) diagrams

                                              l	 circuit diagrams.

                                              Drawings usually use British Standard symbols. However, in order to represent the
                                              wide variety of materials and equipment available, non-standard symbols may
                                              also be used. A legend or key explains them.

            Plans or layout drawings
            Plans or layout drawings are used to locate individual systems within the overall
            project and give an indication of the scale of the project. In addition, there may be
            drawings to show specific fixing, assembly and/or completion details. This is often
            the case where complex construction, lifting or use of a crane is required. These
            details may be provided in elevation, plan or both. They will then become part of
            the contractor’s method statement when the project goes into the construction
            phase. Figure 3.6 is an example.

            Schematic diagrams
            Schematic diagrams, sometimes referred to as block diagrams, can serve many
            purposes, but are primarily provided to show the overall functionality of a system,
            including interfaces and operational requirements. This means they are intended
            to show a sequence of control and connection but not necessarily scale or actual
            positions in the wiring. For example, if a three-plate lighting system were drawn
            as a wiring diagram, the light would be wired before the switch even though the
            switch controls the light. A schematic would show the switch before the light as
            a sequence of control. Schematic or block diagrams are typically used to show
            distribution systems and circuits in large electrical installations having many
            remote distribution boards.

            Wiring diagrams
            Wiring diagrams are generally provided to show in detail how a system or collection
            of systems is put together. This type of drawing shows locations, routing, the length of
            run and types of systems cabling. These types of diagrams are sometimes mistakenly
            referred to when it is actually a circuit diagram that is required.

                                              Circuit diagrams contain information on how circuits and systems operate. They
                                              can be provided as detailed layouts, although some information such as length

              with identifying problems.      their actions may influence a particular component or arrangement.
                                              At different stages of work, the information on the drawings and diagrams is given
                                              in different levels of detail. The information becomes more detailed and accurate
                                              as the project develops.

                                              Levels of drawing
                                              There are five main levels of drawing:
                                              l	   sketch drawings
                                              l	   design and tender drawings

                                              l	   as fitted or installed drawings.

                                              Sketch drawings
                                              Sketch drawings are often hand-drawn sketches to help the designer demonstrate
              KEY TERM                        ideas and interpretations. They are usually drawn in the early stages of a project
              Fluid: open to change or        when the scheme and designs are still fluid. As a result, they can be subject to
              development.                    multiple developments as every stakeholder is adding input to and potentially
                                              changing the scheme.
                                              Sketch drawings are also often used at later stages of a project. Once the
                                              contractors have produced their working drawings, the designer may issue
              KEY TERM                        new sketch drawings for particular design details. These drawings become

                                              conjunction with the specification and other written documents, it is often easier
                                              to show the geographical scope of works by hatching out or blanking out areas

                                              Design drawings are usually first exchanged between designers to ensure
                                              co-ordination, and then to communicate items for consideration under the

            It is important that drawings are easy to understand, and that includes the
            symbols used. British Standard symbols should be used wherever possible. Where
            no standard symbol is available, a specialist symbol can be used which is created
            by the person making the drawings. Whether the symbols are British Standard
            or not, they should be explained in a key or legend. In particular areas, such as
            lighting design, a more detailed legend specifying fitting type, manufacturer,
            source, output and catalogue reference number of products might be required to
            assist the reader to understand the type and quality of the component as well as
            how many are needed and where they are to be located.

              KEY TERM                                Understanding scale in drawings
                                                      Most drawings are produced at a scale that allows the information to be readable.
              Computer-aided design
                                                      In order to determine an appropriate scale, it is essential to know the size of the
              (CAD) software: specialist
              software for producing                  actual object, room or building. Next, it is important to decide on the size of paper
              drawings, which has a                   for the drawing. Very little detail can be communicated on smaller sheets of paper

              every drawing by hand.                      Drawing scales are represented as a ratio. The first number of the ratio
                                                          represents the measurement of the object on the drawing, while the second
                                                          number represents its actual size. For example, on a scale of 1:50, a line on a
                                                          drawing measuring 40 mm (4 cm) represents a wall 50 times bigger in reality,
                                                          so the wall is actually:
                                                          40 mm × 50 = 2000 mm or 2 m
                                                          Or to look at it the other way round, a 4 m (4000 mm) wall in reality is 50
                                                                                                                   4000 mm
                                                          times smaller on a drawing so the line length would be:              = 80mm
                                                                                                                       50
                                                          Typical drawing scales frequently used are:
                                                          l	   1:20 – where 50 mm on a drawing is 1000 mm in reality

                                                      As the size of paper reduces, the width of one size becomes the length of the
                                                      next size down. This is a 71% reduction in size. Reducing by two paper sizes
                                                      – for example, from A0 to A2 – produces an overall 50% (70.07% of 70.07%)

                                                      It is important to select a scale that is clear at the paper size you intend to use.
                                                      For example, drawings of a whole building of 30 × 50 m, at a scale of 1:100,
                                                      will fit onto A1 reasonably well, leaving enough space for title blocks and
                                                      additional notes. The layout of the building will be 500 × 300 mm on paper.
                                                      In this example, it is possible to fill the paper further using a scale of 1:75.

            calling up the relevant drawing on screen. The readability on A3 will depend on
            the size and scale of the original. For example:

              Base load: basic amount         The nuclear industry is responsible for generating a large proportion of the base
              of electricity.                 load of electricity needed in Great Britain. Nuclear reactors are used to provide
                                              the base load because they cannot easily be turned on or off. The nuclear industry
                                              currently has 16 reactors.
                                              Nuclear fission, which takes place in the reactors, creates heat. The heat is used to
                                              create high-pressure steam, which turns turbines coupled to generators to create
                                              electricity.

                                              Coal-fired power
                                              Coal is used as a fuel to heat up water to create high-pressure steam. This steam
                                              turns turbines coupled to generators to create electricity. Traditionally, coal-fired
                                              power stations were the primary source of power generation in Britain. With the
                                              decline of coal production, rising costs of importing coal and changes in legislation
                                              relating to emissions, this source of energy has been squeezed by other producers.
                                              In addition, coal is a fossil fuel, which cannot be replaced.
                                              As a result of all these factors, large-scale providers of coal-fired electricity are
                                              now looking at more carbon-efficient schemes such as large-scale biomass to

              Carbon footprint: a
              measure of carbon
              dioxide emissions from
              burning fossil fuels
              during the production
              and transportation
              process. This may be
              offset by the amount of
              carbon released naturally
              by decay. For example,
              biomass fuel is made
              from plant material
              that would release
              carbon dioxide as it
              rots naturally if left – so
              burning it efficiently as
              a fuel, and gaining use
              from it as a fuel, means
              the carbon footprint is
              reduced making it carbon
              efficient.

            Gas-fired power
            Gas is used to create steam that can be used to generate electricity in the same
            way as coal.
            Demand for gas-fired power in Britain has increased as the demand for coal-fired
            power has declined. Gas is a fossil fuel, like coal, but it is now the largest producer               INDUSTRY TIP

            Other technologies
            Other technologies for producing electricity, including small-scale generation and
            hydro-electricity, represent less than 3% of electricity production in Britain.
            Pumped storage systems allow hydro-electric power to meet demand at peak
            times. The system uses off-peak electricity to pump water from a low level to a
            higher level, where it can be stored. At peak demand times, the stored water is
            released through turbines to create electricity. The cycle can then begin again.

            Balancing the load
            Electricity is not easily stored, so National Grid has to assess power supplies to
            cope with peak demand times as well as off-peak times. It is a complex task to                     KEY TERM
            predict load profiles, negotiate on- and off-grid time for generators and manage                   Load profiles: when and
            any export of electricity to or import from France and/or Ireland.                                 where electricity will be
                                                                                                               needed.
            At a local level, substation transformers need to keep loads balanced as closely as
            possible across the three phases. If this isn’t achieved, the transformer becomes
            less efficient. This is why three phase distribution boards should have their loads
            balanced as closely as possible over the three phases. Consumers may be fined by
            the distribution network operator (DNO) if their loading isn’t well balanced.

            Distribution voltages and networks
            Once the electricity has been transmitted to the particular region in which it is
            required, National Grid depends on historical infrastructure to transform it from
            400 kV or 275 kV to a distribution voltage of 132 kV.
            At this point, distribution is handed to one of the 14 regional distribution network
            operators (DNOs) to manage and maintain. As the regions are quite large, high
            voltages such as 132 kV are required to minimise losses. At these supply voltages,
            cables are still generally on pylons, although some of the infrastructure is buried
            underground.

            Because the switchgear and transformer areas are very large, voltages of 132 kV
            are generally difficult to manage and maintain close to towns and cities. In order
            to make localised distribution more manageable, the voltage is reduced to 33 kV.
            In rural areas, supplies are distributed through cables on wooden, or similar, poles,

                                              roads and across fields. In urban areas the cables are usually buried underground
                                              or can be supplied on small overhead pylons.
                                              These supply cables terminate at primary substations. These substations are large
                                              and unsightly due to the size of the switchgear they accommodate, so they are
                                              normally located in areas around the edges of cities that are not commercially
                                              sensitive, although some are integrated into city centres. Primary substations
                                              transform the electricity to lower voltages for distribution. Some industrial users
                                              want electricity at 33 kV, while other specialist plants such as chemical works use
                                              132 kV.
                                              Primary substations also distribute 11 kV or 6.6 kV supplies to ‘domestic’
                                              transformers located closer to the consumers. These supplies are usually
                                              distributed via cables buried underground in towns and cities or on wooden poles
                                              in more rural areas. Many public or large buildings take their electricity at high
                                              voltage (usually 11 kV) due to the size of their demand, which usually has to be in
                                              excess of 500 kVA.

            ARRANGEMENTS
            The type and rating of electricity supply to an existing installation, given by the
            distribution network operator (DNO), has a great bearing on the design of an
            installation. The type and rating of equipment, for example, and the methods
            of protection against electric shock are areas greatly affected by the supply to
            an installation. For new buildings, those factors will influence the type of supply
            requested.
            Three factors relating to the supply are:
            l	 the number of live conductors
            l	 the maximum current rating
            l	 the earthing system used.

                                                                                                                        INDUSTRY TIP

                                               Larger installations, which need more than 100 A, will normally be given a three-

            TN systems are configurations where the distribution network operator (DNO)
            provides the means of earthing. The two types commonly used in the UK are
            TN-S and TN-C-S.

            TN-S systems
            A TN-S earthing configuration has only one neutral-to-earth connection, which is
            as near as practicable to the source (supply transformer). In low-voltage supplies,
            the consumer’s earth terminal is connected to the metallic sheath of the supply
            cable.

               cables throughout their length and the earth-to-neutral connection close to the supply

            Figure 3.21 shows that the earthing conductor is connected to the DNO’s supply
            cable metallic sheath. This sheathing provides a separate route back to the
            substation transformer. Because the return path is usually a material such as steel,
            the DNO will normally declare a maximum external earth fault loop impedance
            (Ze) of 0.8 Ω.

            Generally, the first unit in an installation, where the supply is split into circuits,              board whereas a final circuit is
            is called the Consumer’s Unit (CU). This may sometimes be referred to as a                          one that supplies current-using
            distribution board or DB and sometimes as a consumer control unit (CCU). The CU                     equipment such as lights and
            will have protective devices inside. They control and protect the circuits and could                heaters or socket outlets.
            include:
            l	 circuit breakers (CB)
            l	 residual current breakers with overload (RCBO)                                                          Hot water
            l	 fuses.

            The CU will also have a main switch, which can be
            used to isolate the entire installation. In a domestic
            dwelling, the main switch must be double-pole,
            meaning it isolates both line and neutral. In some
            three-phase installations that are part of a TN
                                                                                          Final

            pole, switching the three-line conductors only. In this
            situation, the neutral can be isolated by a link in the
            CU.

            Some isolator devices which act as main switches are
            not rated for full load current and, if they are used
            regularly to switch full load, they will eventually fail.

                                               Some CUs are known as split-way boards. This means that some of the modules
                                               can be protected by one RCD or switch and the others by another RCD or switch.
                                               Split-way boards should always have one main switch that can isolate all circuits.
                                               The advantage of split-way boards is that any fault on one circuit will only trip
                                               part of the installation protected by one of the RCDs.

            This requirement demonstrates the importance of dividing an electrical
            installation into different circuit types to meet the different functions of a
            complete working electrical installation.
            By dividing circuits into types based on location and expected loads, system
            reliability can be enhanced and cable kept to sensible sizes. This is because
            different types of load may require different types of protective device. The
            designer will need to assess the current demand, taking diversity into account.
            Circuits can be categorised in the following way:
            l	 Lighting circuits – provided in all installations. They are low-power circuits
               with an almost constant load when lights are operating. For more detail, see
               the section on lighting circuits below.
            l	 Power circuits – provided for socket-outlet circuits. They require larger

               protective devices due to the demand for current and, in most instances,
               require RCD protection due to the additional risk presented by the portable
               equipment connected to the socket outlets. For more detail, see the section on
               power circuits, starting on page 188.
            l	 Alarm and emergency systems – require additional protective measures,

               which include separating them from other circuits so that they are not affected
               by any faults on those other circuits. Further protection by wiring the circuit in
               fireproof cabling, may be considered.
            l	 Data and control circuits – normally wired in different types of cable to a

               low-voltage electrical system. However, the electrical supplies need more
               rigorous cabling and earthing arrangements to reduce interference between
               the different wiring systems and to meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
               requirements.

            Lighting circuits
            Lighting circuits are generally rated at 6 A but can, in some installations, be rated
            at 10 A or 16 A. Consideration must be given to the type of lighting point used for
            higher rated circuits due to requirements of Section 559, Luminaire and Lighting
            Systems in BS 7671.

            With three-plate systems, it can be seen from the diagrams that cable cores need
            jointing to enable them to be extended to a further point. One example of this is
            the common connection between the two-way lighting that requires jointing in

                                              Power circuits
                                              Power circuits generally supply socket outlets but may also supply individual
                                              appliances. Power circuits may be wired in two ways:
                                              l	      ring-final
                                              l	      radial.

                                              Ring-final circuits
                                              Ring-final circuits are the traditional means of wiring socket-outlet circuits within
                                              the UK. The reason for their use was to provide a high number of conveniently
                                              placed outlets adjacent to the loads. The circuit load is shared by two conductors
                                              in parallel. This also assists in improving voltage drop as the conductors being in
                                              parallel reduce the overall resistance.
                                              Ring-final circuits are able to supply an unlimited number of outlets serving a
                                              maximum floor area of 100 m2. Permanent loads, such as immersion heaters,
                                              should not be connected to a ring-final circuit. Ring-final circuits supplying
                                              kitchens should be arranged to have the loads equally distributed around the
                                              circuit. The plugs and fused spur units are normally fitted with 3 A or 13 A fuses.
                                              With technology reducing the consumption of appliances and equipment,
                                              the need for a ring-final circuit is being questioned as they do have several

            disadvantages. If a ring-final circuit becomes open circuit, this may not necessarily
            be detected by the user as power will still be distributed to all socket outlets.
            Circuit conductors may then become overloaded leading to the possibility of fire.
            Earth fault loop impedances and circuit resistance values between live conductors
            may also increase due to this, leading to increased disconnection times. Testing
            continuity of ring-final circuits is also more time-consuming than testing the
            continuity of radial circuits. Designers today are very likely to specify radial
            socket-outlet circuits with a reduced nominal rating of protective device due to
            these reasons. This also reduces the inconvenience of many socket outlets being
            lost due to a single circuit failure.

            Radial circuits
            Radial circuits may be selected to supply multiple socket outlets for the reasons
            given above, and they are also chosen as a means of supplying individual
            appliances or dedicated fixed appliance circuits.

            Wiring systems for different environments
            Different types of wiring system are available because not all systems are suitable
            for all environments or compatible with all types of construction.

            Domestic installations
            These installations tend to use twin and earth cables (referenced as 6242Y by
            wholesalers) or similar types of sheathed cable. This type of cable is ideal because
            it is compatible with the building products used and the finishes expected by the

            into tight locations. Although other types of cables could be used, the relatively
            low cost of this type is also important in the domestic market, which is very cost

                                              probably includes the widest range of electrical installations. Commercial
                                              installations can be found in large converted houses, listed buildings, purpose-built

                                              compatible with the structure and the finished layouts need to be either as cost
                                              effective or as sympathetic to the aesthetics of the building as possible.

                                              Ladder racking is used almost exclusively for armoured cables and typically
                                              where large amounts of heavy cables are installed because it is strong enough to
                                              withstand the weight.

                                              Conduit systems
                                              In the UK, conduit systems are used in a number of ways. They include complete
              ACTIVITY                        systems for single thermoplastic or XLPE cables with just basic insulation. This
              State the sizes (diameters)     gives mechanical protection to prevent damage to the insulation and reduces the
              of metal conduit available.
                                              risks of shock or fault hazard.
                                              Conduit systems can be made of plastic, galvanised metal, stainless steel or black
                                              enamelled steel. Where there is risk of damp or corrosion, PVC or galvanised
                                              conduit should be selected. Where strong mechanical protection is required,
                                              galvanised conduit is normally used.

                         INDUSTRY TIP
              Always try to draw all cables
              into conduit simultaneously,
              to prevent damage. Trunking
              systems allow easy access, to
              enable the addition of extra
              cables at a later date.

                                              Conduit systems are also used in part for protection of wiring system ‘drops’ to
                                              electrical equipment, so that walls or sections of building work can be completed
                                              and the cables pulled in later.

            Couplings are used to connect lengths of conduit. Where a conduit enters a box
            that does not have a threaded entry, it is terminated by a coupling and a brass
            bush to complete the mechanical connection.




            p	 Figure 3.51 This stop end box has been converted into a back entry box using a conduit coupling
               and male bush arrangement. In proprietary assemblies, the box would have a manufactured
               thread into which a conduit with a male thread could be screwed

               or fabricated

            Where two systems cannot be screwed together, a running coupling might be
            fabricated on site using two couplings, a nipple, a locknut and a length of conduit
            with an extra long thread. However running couplings create a potential weakness
            in the conduit and are best avoided.
            Spacer-bar saddles are the most commonly used method of securing conduit.
            Distance saddles are used where conduit is fixed to uneven or damp surfaces.
            Where hygiene is important, hospital saddles are used to allow easy cleaning of
            the shaped saddle and around the conduit.

                                                  Trunking systems
                                                  In the UK, most of the wiring contained in trunking systems is single insulated
                                                  cable. However, trunking systems can be used to carry many different types of
                                                  cables, depending only on whether they will fit. The systems are available in a
                                                  range of shapes with different numbers and profiles of compartments. Standard
                                                  earth fault loop impedance values are often less on site than calculated. This is
                                                  because conduit and trunking systems, and their support systems, can work as
                                                  parallel conductors in real life, but cannot realistically be calculated.




                         INDUSTRY TIP
              Mini-trunking is just a
              small version of larger PVC
              trunking. It can be supplied
              with a self-adhesive backing,
              to allow it to be fixed easily to
              a wall.

                                                  Dado trunking systems are often found in offices where there are
                                                  large numbers of data and power outlets. They provide a multi-compartment

                                                  distributed around the work space. They also offer flexibility in that the positions
                                                  of outlets can easily be changed, to a degree, any time after installation to meet

            Fixings
            The choice of fixings depends very much on the combined weight of the
            containment system and the cables in it. Often, many kilograms of cable need
            to be supported. For example, larger cable such as four-core 240 mm2 steel wire
            armoured cable can weigh in the region of 13 kg/m. So a simple fixing with a
            round headed wood screw and wall plug is often not enough.                                   p	 Figure 3.59 Anchor bolt fixing

            It is quite likely that specialist advice from proprietary fixings manufacturers will
            be required, along with confirmation from the structural engineer that the floor
            above can cope with the loading from below. Where the load is considerable,
            substantial fixings such as anchor bolts or anchor brackets will be required.                        4.0 mm2

            do not, however, take into consideration all of the factors that affect the ability
            of a conductor to carry current. Calculations therefore need to be carried out to
            determine the suitable cable cross-sectional area (csa).

            provides a simplistic approach for simple single circuit design. More complex

            circuit design procedures are covered in Book 2, Chapter 5.
            Before looking at the procedure for selecting the correct conductor csa, we will
            consider the factors that affect the ability of a conductor to carry current.

            Conductor insulation
            It is the conductor insulation that governs the overall capacity of a conductor,
            as it is the weak point. Copper can carry large currents before it reaches melting
            point but the insulation cannot. General thermoplastic insulation has a maximum
            operating temperature of 70 °C so it is this temperature that sets the current limit.
            It is assumed that the initial temperature of any conductor, and therefore insulation,              30 °C                     0A
            is 30 °C before any current is put through the conductor. As soon as current flows,          Cables installed at
            the conductor temperature increases. The amount of current that will cause the               lower temperatures
                                                                                                         may have a greater
            temperature to reach 70 °C is the upper limit of the conductor.                              capacity

            Table F6 of the IET On-Site Guide, or the extract on the next page, shows that a             p	 Figure 3.61 PVC/PVC flat twin,
            single-phase 4 mm2 flat-profile cable installed in free air (method C, column 6) has a          70 °C thermoplastic, 30 °C
                                                                                                            ambient

            37 A would cause the conductor’s temperature to rise from 30 °C to 70 °C.

            Grouping of circuits
            Where circuits are grouped together, either in the same containment system such
            as conduit, or clipped close together on a wall, the heat from one circuit can have
            an effect on others. Rating factors for grouping (Cg) are applied to circuits using
            Table F3 of the IET On-Site Guide. As can be seen from the table, the more circuits
            that are grouped, the more the conductor’s capacity is reduced. As an example, if
            a new circuit was installed into a cable basket with six other circuits, that would
            be seven in total. From the table, cables bunched in air (methods A to F) with a
            total number of circuits being seven has a rating factor of 0.54. This means that
            the conductor’s capacity is reduced to 54% of the tabulated value.
            Where the horizontal clearance between cables exceeds twice their diameter no
            factor need be applied. Cables are assumed to be equally loaded. Where cables are
            expected to carry no more than 30% of their grouped rating they may be ignored
            so far as grouping is concerned. The IET On-Site Guide contains more conditions
            regarding grouping.

                                                   Method of installation
                                                   Basic methods of installation are listed below but for a concise list, see Table 4A2
                                                   in Appendix 4 of BS 7671. The method used to install cables can affect the ability
                                                   for a cable to dissipate heat, meaning that cables could run too hot if the correct
                                                   method or table selection isn’t considered. When selecting a conductor csa from
                                                   the relevant current capacity table, each column represents a different method of
                                                   installation. The common methods include:
                                                   l	   Method A: enclosed in conduit in an insulated wall.
                                                   l	   Method B: enclosed in surface-mounted conduit.
                                                   l	   Method C: clipped directly to a surface in free air.
                                                   l	   Method D: buried in the ground directly or within ducts.

                                                        thermal insulation not exceeding 100 mm thickness.
                                                   l	   Method 101: in contact with wooden joists or a plaster ceiling and covered by

                                                   l	   Method 102: in a stud wall containing thermal insulation with the cable
                                                        touching the wall.
                                                   l	   Method 103: in a stud wall containing thermal insulation with the cable not in

            where It is the tabulated current-carrying capacity specified
            (see step 5).
            Note: any factor that is 1 may be ignored.
            Step 5: Use the correct IET On-Site Guide cable selection table from:
            l	 Table F4(i) for single-core cables having 70 °C thermoplastic insulation
            l	 Table F5(i) for multi-core cables (non-armoured) having 70 °C thermoplastic
               insulation
            l	 Table F6 for multi-core flat profile cables having 70 °C thermoplastic insulation.

            Select, using the correct column number relating to the installation method, a
            value of tabulated current equal to or larger than that calculated in step 4.
            This will now ensure that the cable selected is suitable for current-carrying
            capacity.
            Step 6: Ensure that the selected csa is suitable for voltage drop. For the cable csa
            selection tables used in step 5, each has a corresponding voltage drop table or
            column. The values given in these tables or columns represent the value of voltage
            drop, in millivolts per ampere per metre of circuit (mV/A/m). The circuit length
            determined in step 3 is required to determine voltage drop but remember that
            the circuit (cable) length is the length of the line conductor with the neutral, not
            added to the neutral. For example, if a twin cable has a length of 10 m, that is the
            length of the line with neutral. The line added to the neutral would be 20 m (there
            and back). The values of voltage drop per metre include the neutral resistance
            within the values.
            Apply the following formula to determine the value of voltage drop:

                                    l b × length × mV/A/m
                   voltage drop =                         (volts)

                                              Currently, BS 7671 states that values of voltage drop for installation supplied
                                              from a public network should not exceed:
                                              l	 3% of the supply voltage for lighting circuits (3% of 230 V = 6.9 V)
                                              l	 5% of the supply voltage for power circuits (5% of 230 V = 11.5 V).

                                              As long as the voltage drop calculated for the selected cable csa is within the
                                              values above, the cable selected is suitable. If the calculated voltage drop is
                                              too high, the next largest csa is selected and calculated for voltage drop until a
                                              suitable csa is found.
                                              Note: if a final circuit is supplied by a distribution circuit, the voltage drop for the
                                              distribution circuit will also need to be taken into account.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               Determine a suitable csa for a conductor where a circuit is to be wired using
                                               flat-profile 70 °C thermoplastic insulated twin and cpc cable to supply a single-
                                               phase 6 kW water heater. The circuit is to be clipped directly to a plastered wall
                                               to a length of 21 m. The highest ambient temperature is 35 °C and protection
                                               for the circuit is by a BS EN 60898 circuit breaker. The cable passes through
                                               and is totally surrounded by 100 mm of thermal insulation. The circuit is not
                                               grouped with any other circuits.
                                               Step 1

                                               The next suitable nominal rating of protective device is 32 A.

                                               Gather information such as:
                                               ●	 Circuit length = 21 m.

                                               ●	 Rating factor for ambient temperature C a = 0.94.

                                               ●	 Rating factor for thermal insulation Ci = 0.78.

                                               ●	 Rating factor for grouping of circuits C g = 1 (so can be ignored).

                                                                                                             Chapter 3 Electrical technology

              So:
                    It ≥       32      = 43.7A
                           0.94 × 0.78
              So the cable must be capable of carrying a current of 43.7 A as a minimum.
              Step 5
              Using Table F6 for multi-core flat profile cables having 70 °C thermoplastic
              insulation and looking at column 6 (method C), a suitable conductor csa is
              6 mm2 having a tabulated rating (It) of 47 A.
              Step 6
              To determine the value of voltage drop:
                                     l b × length × mV/A/m
                    voltage drop =                         (volts)
                                              1000
              Column 8 of Table F6 gives a value of voltage drop in mV/A/m for a 6 mm2 as
              7.3 mV/A/m.
              So:
                                     26 × 21 × 7.3
                    voltage drop =                 = 3.99 V
                                         1000
              As this is within 11.5 V for a power circuit (5% of 230 V), this is suitable.
              So the cable selected is a 6 mm2 twin with cpc 70 °C thermoplastic insulated
              flat-profile cable.
                                                                                                         ACTIVITY

            Fuses have been a tried and tested method of circuit protection for many years. A
            fuse is a very basic protection device that is destroyed and breaks the circuit
            should the current exceed the rating of the fuse. Once the fuse has ‘blown’ (i.e.
            the element of the fuse has melted or ruptured), the fuse needs to be replaced.
            BS 3036 semi-enclosed rewireable fuses
            In older equipment, the fuse may be just a length of appropriate fuse wire
            fixed between two terminals. These devices are now becoming uncommon
            as electrical installations are rewired or updated. One of the main
            problems associated with rewirable fuses is the overall lack of protection,
            including insufficient breaking capacity ratings. Another major problem is
            unreliability, which is often caused by using the wrong gauge of wire when
            changing the fuse. The overall reliability of such fuses cannot be guaranteed
            because a wide range of factors can cause them to fail. Typical factors
            include wire being labelled with an incorrect current rating and the number
            of times and the length of time that a fuse wire has been subjected to
            overload.                                                                     p	 Figure 3.63 Fuse carrier without wire
            The lack of reliability of these fuses is a concern to designers and duty holders.
            Due to the lack of sensitivity, a special factor has been applied to Appendix 4 of
            BS 7671 to account for BS 3036 rewirable fuses. This rating factor (Cf) is 0.725.

                                                 These modern fuses are generally incorporated within sealed ceramic cylindrical
                                                 bodies (or cartridges). The whole cartridge needs to be replaced if the fuse
                                                 ruptures. Although these devices have fixed time current curves, they can be
                                                 configured to assist selectivity, which used to be referred to as discrimination.
                                                 The benefit of BS 88 fuses is their simplicity and reliability, coupled with high
                                                 short-circuit breaking capacity. These fuses are otherwise called High Rupturing

                                                 There are three circuit breaker types: Type B, Type C and Type D. The current flow at
                                                 which they trip depends upon the level of overcurrent and is usually determined by
                                                 a magnetic device within the circuit breaker. The value of current at which each type
                                                 of circuit breaker disconnects instantaneously is referred to as Ia.

                                                 Type B trips at between three and five times the rated current.
                                                 These are normally used for domestic circuits and commercial applications where
                                                 there is no inrush current to cause the circuit breaker to trip. As an example, the
                                                 magnetic trip in a 32 A Type B circuit breaker could be 160 A. So Ia = 5 × In.

            Residual current devices
            The basic principle of residual current devices (RCDs) is a simple balance
            arrangement. When the load is connected to the supply through the RCD, the
            line and neutral conductors are connected through primary windings on a
            toroidal transformer. In this arrangement the secondary winding of the toroidal
            transformer is used as a sensing coil and is electrically connected to a sensitive
                                                                        Test button

                                              mechanism. When the line and neutral currents are balanced, as in a healthy
                                              circuit, they produce equal and opposite magnetic fluxes in the transformer
                                              core so no current is generated in the sensing coil. Where there is an imbalance
                                              of current in the line and neutral due to an amount of current leaking to earth,
                                              the magnetic flux in the transformer coil is detected by the sensing coil and the
                                              current generated triggers the tripping mechanism.
                                              Tripping mechanisms in circuit breakers are triggered by large fault currents
                                              but an RCD tripping mechanism is triggered by very small currents. As these
              ACTIVITY                        small currents have little energy, all RCDs have test buttons fitted which must

                                              the RCD remains effective.

            Spacing factors of wiring enclosures
            Spacing factors are the free air allowances made around each cable installed
            in a conduit or trunking system. The method described below can be used to
            determine the size of conduit or trunking needed to accommodate multiple cables
            of the same or different sizes. It employs a unit system, with a factor allocated
            to each cable size. Tables in Appendix E of the IET On-Site Guide can be used to        KEY TERMS

                                              A number of other factors also have a bearing on the number of cables that can
                         INDUSTRY TIP         be installed in conduit and trunking. These include:
                                              ●	 level of care during installation
              The maximum distance

                                              ●	 tolerance in conduit and trunking.

                                              The tables on the following pages can only give guidance on the maximum
                                              number of cables that should be drawn into an enclosure but should ensure
                                              an easy pull with low risk of damage to the cables. However, this method does
                                              not assess the electrical effects of grouping. It may also sometimes be more
                                              economical to divide the circuits concerned between a number of enclosures
                                              rather than have one very large enclosure.
                                              As the grouping factor (Cg) is used to determine the cable cross-sectional area,
                                              the more cables installed, the larger the cross-sectional area required. This has
                                              a negative impact, so it is ultimately better to install fewer cables in the same
                                              enclosure.

              EXAMPLES
              With reference to Table E1 of the IET On-Site Guide, a conduit run of 3 m with
              no bends and a total of ten 4 mm2 thermoplastic stranded cables has a cable
              factor of 10 × 58 = 580.
              Reference to Table E2 indicates that the minimum size for the conduit would be
              25 mm diameter, which has a conduit factor of 800.
              With reference to Table E3 of the IET On-Site Guide, a conduit run of 10 m with
              two bends and a total of ten 4 mm2 thermoplastic stranded cables has a cable
              factor of 10 × 43 = 430.
              Reference to Table E4 indicates that the minimum size for the conduit would be
              32 mm diameter, which has a conduit factor of 474.

                                                 EXAMPLES
                                                 With reference to Table E5 of the IET On-Site Guide, a trunking run of 10 m with
                                                 two bends and a total of 20 × 4 mm2 and 10 × 16 mm2 thermoplastic stranded

                                                 Reference to Table E6 indicates that the minimum size for the trunking would be
                                                 either 100 × 25, having a factor of 993, or 50 × 50, having a factor of 1037.

            Extraneous conductive parts
            Extraneous conductive parts are parts that are not part of electrical equipment
            or systems but may still introduce a potential path to earth. However, it is often
            difficult to establish what is or is not an extraneous conductive part. Some
            conductive parts may be partially insulated from earth – for example, where an
            insulated board that is part of the building construction creates a high resistance.
            One method of checking if an extraneous part has a path to earth is to use an
            insulation resistance test instrument. Connect the instrument between a known
            point of earth, such as the earth pin on a socket outlet, and the part that needs to
            be defined. If the reading is low (e.g. below 0.05 MΩ or 50 000 Ω) when tested at
            250 V DC, the part has a low enough resistance to earth to cause potential harm
            and may require some form of protective bonding.
            Examples of extraneous conductive parts include:
            l	 structural steelwork
            l	 reinforcement bars
            l	 pipes

            l	 other metal components that are not part of an electrical system but

               introduce a potential path to earth.

            Exposed conductive parts
            Exposed conductive parts are parts that form part of the electrical system and
            should therefore be connected to earth. The only metallic parts of an electrical         KEY TERM
            system that should not be connected to earth are metal casings of Class II               Class II equipment:

            This is the most common method of fault protection in electrical installation in

                                              Basic protection
                                              Basic protection is a means of stopping persons from receiving an electric shock
                                              by touching live parts directly. All electrical accessories such as socket outlets,
                                              switches, distribution boards and luminaires have live parts enclosed within a
                                              barrier or enclosure. These barriers must not have any holes in them allowing
                                              persons to put in a finger (IP2X), or, if there is a hole, the live parts must be
                                              distanced enough so the finger cannot touch them (IPXXB). There must also be no
                                              opening on their top surfaces allowing anything to drop into the live parts (IP4X
                                              and IPXXD).
                                              All conductors or live parts not enclosed by a barrier or enclosure must have
                                              adequate insulation around them. The insulation must be suitable for the voltage
                                              of the circuit.

                                              Main protective bonding conductors
                         INDUSTRY TIP         Main protective bonding (MPB) conductors, sized in accordance with Section 4 of
                                              the IET On-Site Guide or Chapter 54 of BS 7671 must be installed connecting the

                                              connection must be made within 600 mm of any stop valve or meter, or point of
                                              entry to the building but before any branch pipe is installed.
                                              Connection is made to the pipework using a specific bonding clamp which
                                              complies with BS 951 Electrical earthing, Clamps for earthing and bonding.
                                              Different clamps have colour coding on them for installing in different conditions.
                                              They may be:
                                              l	 red for dry conditions
                                              l	 blue for damp locations.

                                              In some situations, supplementary bonding may need to be installed but this will
                                              be covered in Book 2, Chapter 6, Inspection, testing and commissioning electrical

                                              In some situations where the earth fault loop impedance is too high to generate
                                              a high enough current to cause disconnection of a protective device, an RCD is
                                              installed (or RCBO) as these disconnect at much lower current values. If an RCD is
                                              installed for this purpose alone and not additional protection, the RCD residual current
                                              setting (I∆n) does not need to be 30 mA or less as long as the fault current causes
                                              disconnection within the required time for disconnection, or by the product standard.

                                              Additional protection
                                              Additional protection is required in situations where the risk of electric shock
                                              is increased, because any failure in basic protection presents a greater risk. For
                                              example, flexible cable might become damaged, cases to appliances might
                                              become broken, or risk of shock to the body might be increased due to the
                                              location, such as a bathroom full of steam.
                                              Additional protection is provided on final circuits by an RCD or RCBO which has a
                                              residual current setting (I∆n) not exceeding 30 mA. Additional protection is required
                                              in most electrical installations:
                                              l	   where socket outlets rated at 32 A or less are used by ordinary persons

            Circuit protective conductors (cpc)
                                                                                                    ACTIVITY
            These conductors are essential for ADS to work. As ADS requires disconnection
                                                                                                    Do you remember Ohm’s
            within a specific time, a large enough fault current must flow to earth. This can
                                                                                                    law from Chapter 2? How
            only be achieved if the cpc has a low enough resistance, as Ohm’s law states            much fault current would
            that resistance, with a set voltage, dictates current flow. If the current isn’t high   flow in a 230 V circuit if
            enough, disconnection will not occur in the required time.                              a fault created an overall
                                                                                                    resistance of 0.2 Ω?
            When we consider the total earth fault loop impedance on the following pages,
            the cpc is referred to as R2.
            The cpc also performs a role of providing equal potential between all exposed
            conductive parts.

            Suitable means of earthing
            The type of protective device selected for ADS is completely dependent on the
            means of earthing. Together, the installation and supply make up the means of
            earthing. TN systems are regarded as having a reliable path to earth, so generating
            high earth fault currents. However, TT installations rely on the general mass
            of earth as an earth return path. As this resistance is likely to be high, when
            compared to TN systems, alternative protective devices may need selecting, such
            as RDCs, as they react more quickly to lower earth fault currents.
            One part of the earthing system that also needs to be considered is the earthing
            conductor. This is the conductor that links the MET to the means of earthing. This
            may be the sheath of the supplier’s cable (TN-S) or an earth electrode (TT) or the
            supplier’s PEN conductor (TN-C-S).
            Although the earthing conductor may be sized by calculation, the simple method
            is to ensure that it is:
            l	 the same csa as the supply tails, where the tails are up to and equal to 16 mm2
                                2                                               2          2

            Earth fault loop impedance
            The total earth fault loop impedance (Zs) directly affects the amount of current
            under earth fault conditions. The component parts of the earth fault path are
            described below.
            If the earth fault loop impedance is too high, then disconnection will take too long
            as the earth fault current will be too low. If earth fault loop impedance is low, the
            disconnection will occur quickly as the current is high.

            Summary of ADS
            If an earth fault occurs, a low resistance to earth generates a high fault current.
            The higher the fault current, the quicker the disconnection time. In certain
            situations, equal potential will reduce the risk until disconnection does occur.

                                              Components of an earth fault loop impedance path

                                               KEY FACTS
                                               In TN systems, the earth fault loop impedance is a limiting factor to the
                                               operation of the protective device in an appropriate time. This value can be
                                               expressed as:
                                                   Z s = Z e + ( R 1 + R 2) Ω

                                               where:
                                               Zs = impedance in ohms (Ω) of the fault loop, including the source
                                               impedance plus the installation impedances
                                               Ze = impedance in ohms (Ω) of the fault path external to the installation
                                               R1 = impedance in ohms (Ω) of the phase conductor
                                               R2 = impedance in ohms (Ω) of the circuit protective conductor.
                                               Ohm’s law tells us that the total earth fault loop impedance will
                                               directly affect the value of earth fault current, which in turn affects the
                                               disconnection time of the device as:
                                                        U
                                                   Ia ≤ 0
                                                        Zs
                                               where:
                                               Ia = current in amperes (A) causing the automatic operation of the
                                               disconnecting device within the time specified
                                               Uo = nominal AC line voltage to earth in volts (V), usually 230 V.

            Isolation and switching
            A typical electrical installation will contain many different switches or isolators.
            It is very important to know what the purpose of the device is in order to select
            the right type of device. BS 7671 requires isolation and switching devices for the
            following reasons.
            l	   Isolation – a means of cutting off electricity to all or part of an installation to
                 allow safe electrical work to be carried out.
            l	   Switching for mechanical maintenance – a means of safely stopping a
                 machine, equipment or appliance from operating in any way to allow safe non-
                 electrical work that does not involve exposure to potentially live parts.
            l	   Emergency switching – a means of quickly stopping a machine, equipment or
                 appliance from operating in the event of an emergency.
            l	   Functional switching – a means of controlling a machine, equipment or
                 appliance such as turning it on or off.
            l	   Undervoltage protection – a means of stopping a machine, equipment or
                 appliance from automatically restarting following a loss or drop in voltage
                 where sudden restarting could cause danger.

                                                                                                       electrical work to be

            heaters. This arcing could destroy device contacts or, as a minimum, create high
            resistance to the contacts, which in turn creates excessive heat through constant
            use.
            Switches, however, are designed to break the full load current without
            deterioration to the contacts.
            If a device that is classed as an isolator is to be used, or positioned where it can be

                                                while the circuit is securely isolated.
                                                Whenever an electrically skilled person works on all or part of a circuit, the circuit
                                                should always be isolated at the start (origin) of the circuit.

                                                Switching for mechanical maintenance
                                                Mechanical maintenance covers many tasks carried out on a variety of different
                                                items of equipment. Provided that the work does not involve exposure to
                                                electrical terminals, it can be done by unskilled (electrically) persons. This work
                                                could include, among many other tasks:
                                                l	 changing or adjusting drive belts on a machine
                                                l	 installing or altering the pipework to a gas cooker

                                                l	 cleaning air filters inside an air handling unit (AHU).

                                                For these situations, a device capable of switching full load current must be located
                                                ‘local’ to the equipment. Ideally, the device must be in a position where the person
                                                carrying out the mechanical maintenance can keep the switch under their effective
                                                supervision so nobody else can switch it on. Common devices for this purpose include:
                                                l	 fused spur connection units
                                                l	 double-pole switches
                                                l	 plugs and socket outlets.

            If the device cannot be easily supervised then the device should be lockable – for
            example, a lockable rotary switch – to remove the risk of someone else switching
            it back on.

            Emergency switching
                                                                                                               INDUSTRY TIP
            Emergency switching devices must be capable of cutting off full load current. If a
            resident within a dwelling is concerned about the safety of an electrical system,            In domestic dwellings, the
            for example following a major water leakage, they are able to cut off the supply             main switch can act as an
            easily.                                                                                      emergency switch, which is
                                                                                                         why it is normally coloured
            In other installations where items such as rotating machines can cause a danger,
                                                                                                         red.
            emergency switching is normally provided by stop buttons. When installing stop
            buttons to a machine or workshop, consider the following.
            l	 Stop buttons must be near to the risk where someone using the machine can
               easily reach it if they are in danger.
            l	 Stop buttons must not be capable of being reset from another place unless the

               reset is by a key switch.
            l	 If this is not the case, the stop button should latch in the off position. This ensures

               that the person resetting the circuit has to be where the danger happened so they
               can see that the danger has been removed before resetting the circuit.
            l	 Where the stop button could be reset by untrained persons, such as in a school

               workshop, it should be key operated.

            Functional switching
            Functional switching is probably the most common type of switch found in an
            installation. Functional switching allows equipment to be switched on or off as needed. It
            should be in a convenient place where manual operation is required. An example would
            be a light switch for a room, located by the entrance door to that room.
            Where a room has more than one entrance, two-way and/or intermediate
            switching would normally be provided.
            Functional switches may also be in the form of:
            l	   timeclocks
            l	   passive infra-red (PIR) sensors
            l	   plugs and socket outlets (rated at or below 32 A)                                       KEY TERM
            l	   switches on socket outlets                                                              Passive infrared (PIR):
            l	   contactors                                                                              a sensor that detects
            l	   standard switches                                                                       movement.
            l	   push switches
            l	   switched fused connection units.
            Devices that should never be used as a functional switch include:
            l	 fuses
            l	 luminaire connections such as plug-in ceiling roses
            l	 unswitched fused connection units

            l	 socket outlets rated above 32 A.

                                              Where a functional switch is controlling discharge luminaires, like fluorescent
                                              fittings, the switch must be rated high enough to manage the surge current that
                                              happens when the load is first switched on. For example, a 6 A lighting circuit with
                                              fluorescent lights will typically have 10 A switches for this reason. Care must also
                                              be taken when selecting dimmer switches as some do not perform well when
                                              underloaded as well as overloaded.

                                              Using the IET On-Site Guide
                                              The IET On-Site Guide (OSG) is an essential companion to BS 7671, in that it
                                              describes technical regulations and best practices in an easier to follow format.
                                              It is important to understand that using the information and tables within the
                                              OSG to design an electrical installation will always lead to compliance with
                                              BS 7671, but it may not lead to the cheapest design. This is because circuit design
                                              and selection tables are based on maximum circuit or supply values, such as
                                              external earth fault loop impedances (Ze) being at their maximum recommended
                                              values.
                                              In reality, many of the actual values are lower, so detailed calculations of values
                                              may produce smaller cable sizes or longer permitted circuit lengths. However,
                                              considering the OSG is intended for single-phase dwellings or small commercial
                                              installations, the differences are relatively minimal.
                                              Where a statement in the OSG links directly to a requirement in BS 7671, the
                                              regulation number is shown in the margin.

                                              Structure of the On-Site Guide
                                              The OSG is broken into 12 sections and also has 12 appendices. The details
                                              contained in each of these is shown in the table below.
              Section 1    Introduction      This section details what the OSG is intended to cover (its scope). It also contains details
                                             relating to the relationship between building regulations for the different nations in the UK.
                                             There is a useful section (1.3) which details the information needed before starting work on an
                                             installation.
              Section 2    The electrical    This section details the different supply arrangements, including:
                           supply            ●	 earthing arrangements
                                             ●	 suppliers’ equipment
                                             ●	 consumer unit assemblies
                                             ●	 separation of gas installation systems
                                             ●	 portable generator earthing arrangements, including the need for certain arrangements to
                                                have earth electrodes.
              Section 3    Protection        This section gives an overview of all the different types of protective device and the types of
                                             protection they provide.
                                             It details how these devices are used to comply with the requirements for Fault Protection by
                                             Automatic Disconnection of Supply (ADS).
                                             This section also summarises the requirements of Chapter 41 of BS 7671, including how to
                                             arrange an installation to provide ADS and the application of RCDs, why they are installed and
                                             what requirements they meet.
                                             There is a great deal of detail on how surge protection devices are used for protecting
                                             installations and equipment, including where they should be installed.
                                             With arc fault detection devices (AFDD) becoming a requirement, rather than a
                                             recommendation, in BS 7671, this section also contains information on their use.

              Section 4   Earthing and     There is a difference in the needs for earthing and bonding, even though the cables used to
                          bonding          have the same identification colours.
                                           Earthing and circuit protective conductor cross-sectional areas are simply sized in accordance
                                           with the size of the corresponding line conductor csa and this is reflected in Tables 4.4(i) and (ii).
                                           This section also gives details of where main or supplementary bonding is required, or
                                           situations where they are not required. Where bonding is required, tables in Section 4 give
                                           minimum conductor sizes for given situations.
                                           Where installations form part of a TT earthing arrangement, Section 4 also gives guidance on
                                           the earth electrodes used.
              Section 5   Isolation and    Section 5 gives a summary of the requirements for installing devices to facilitate:

                                           ●	 firefighters switching.
                                           The most common devices installed are either functional switches and switching for
                                           mechanical maintenance, as these are most often used to control appliances and loads such
                                           as lighting control, socket outlets, fused connection units, or appliance switches. Isolation is
                                           generally provided at the origin of every installation and the origin of every circuit.
              Section 6   Labelling        This section simply contains information of where any label, notice or chart is required, with
                                           some samples.
              Section 7   Final circuits   This section is very detailed in circuit design procedures without the need for calculations.
                                           Table 7.1(i) provides minimum conductor cross-sectional areas (csa) for circuits based on
                                           circuit protective device ratings (In), circuit lengths and the installation earthing arrangement.
                                           This table is based on assumed loadings lower than the protective device, as given in the first
                                           table in this section which is not numbered.

              Section 10     Guidance on          This section gives a very detailed ‘how to’ guide to inspection and testing, including detailed
                             initial testing of   explanations on how to conduct each test necessary on most installations.

              Section 11     Operations of        This section gives advice on the need for RCDs to comply with BS 7671, including where they
                             RCDs                 are used for additional protection, or to meet disconnection times, as there is a difference in
                                                  relation to the maximum residual current ratings (IΔn). This section also gives guidance on the
                                                  use of the integral test button.
              Section 12     Prosumers’           This section introduces the new Part 8 of BS 7671. Electrical installations were treated as
                             installations        electrical consumers, as they used electricity from the supply. Now that many installations
                                                  have methods of generating electricity, or producing it, they are classed as prosumers. These
                                                  installations have electrical management systems that can cut the supply when enough power
                                                  is being generated by photovoltaic (PV) solar cells on the roof or micro-wind turbines. Even
                                                  an electric vehicle, plugged in and charged, can be used to feed in electricity, to be used by
                                                  appliances, heating or lighting, when needed.
                                                                          Appendices
              The appendices in the OSG provide useful tables and information linked to the sections and BS 7671.
              Appendix A     Maximum              There are two main tables in this appendix. They both give advice on how to apply diversity to
                             demand and           the maximum demand. Diversity is the understanding that not all loads will be on fully all the
                             diversity            time.
                                                  Table A1 provides guidance on the application of diversity for a final circuit, based on the
                                                  equipment it serves.
                                                  Table A2 provides guidance on how to apply diversity to an installation or a distribution circuit
                                                  based on the connected final circuits, what they supply, and the type of installation.
              Appendix B     Maximum              This appendix contains seven tables which detail the maximum permissible values of earth
                             permissible          fault loop impedance when measured during inspection and testing.
                             measured             When circuit impedance is measured, either by adding R1 + R2 to Ze, or by direct
                             earth fault loop     measurement using an earth loop impedance tester, the circuit is not under loaded conditions
                             impedance            and therefore it is at a lower temperature. As a lower temperature means a lower resistance/
                                                  impedance, the values given in the tables in this appendix are adjusted to suit this when
                                                  compared to those in BS 7671.
                                                  The tables in Appendix B are adjusted to 80% of those in BS 7671.
              Appendix C     Selection            This appendix gives guidance on the types of standard cables available and their particular
                             and type of          uses.
                             cable for uses       It also gives guidance on the effects on cable insulation or sheathing with commonly used
                             and external         materials, such as expandable polystyrene foams, natural rubber grommets, or wood
                             influences           preservers, among other things.
                                                  This appendix also gives advice on protecting exposed metalwork against corrosion.

                                                    INDUSTRY TIP
              One reason users of installations did not formerly use the integral test button to test their
              RCDs every three months was because they didn’t want to have to keep re-setting clocks.
              The recommended time between tests was then changed to six months, to coincide with the
              changing of the clocks between GMT and BST.

              Appendix D   Methods of          This appendix deals with recommendations relating to the supporting of cables, as well as the
                           support for         supporting of wiring systems such as conduit and trunking. This information is contained in the
                           cables and          following tables:
                           wiring systems      ●	 Table D1: spacings between supports for cables depending on their diameter and whether
                                                   they are run horizontally or vertically.
                                               ●	 Table D2: maximum length of span and heights above ground for cables spanning buildings
                                                   or supports outside. These are dependent on the method by which the cable is supported
                                                   and whether there are vehicle movements below.
                                               ●	 Table D3: spacings for supports for conduits, depending on the type of conduit, the conduit
                                                   diameter and if the conduit is run vertically or horizontally.
                                               ●	 Table D4: spacings for support of trunking, based on the type of trunking, the trunking csa
                                                   and if the trunking is run horizontally or vertically
                                               ●	 Table D5: this gives the recommended radius of bends made to cables, based on the cable
                                                   type and diameter.
              Appendix E   Cable capacities    This appendix gives guidance on the maximum number of cables that can be drawn into a
                           for trunking and    section of conduit or trunking, depending on several factors, such as the length of run, number
                           conduit             of bends and diameter – or dimension – of the conduit or trunking respectively.
                                               The six tables in total are all paired together, so one table gives factors for the cables, based on
                                               their csa, and these factors are used to obtain a figure based on the total intended cables. The
                                               paired table gives a factor based on the maximum capacity of the conduit or trunking allowing
                                               for an air gap inside the wiring system.
                                               As an example, Table E1 gives factors for cables in short straight runs, and the paired table E2
                                               gives the overall factor for the short straight runs of conduit. To determine how many 1.5 mm2
                                               stranded cables can be run in a 20 mm conduit, you must:
                                               1	 Determine the factor for a 20 mm short straight run of conduit from Table E2 – this is 460.
                                               2	 Now determine the factor for a stranded 1.5 mm2 cable from Table E1 – this is 31.
                                               3	Apply
                                                 460
                                               	     = 14.83
                                                  31
                                               	 Which means no more than 14 whole cables should be accommodated into this 20 mm
                                                 conduit.
                                               The other table pairs are:

                                               further documents are needed to accompany them, such as schedules of circuits and results.
                                               The samples also show how they should be completed with samples for each.
              Appendix H   Standard circuit    This appendix gives guidance on how particular circuits are arranged to minimise the risk of
                           arrangements        overloading them, and these are intended to be used alongside the tables in Section 7.
                                               Much of the information in this appendix is guidance, but if followed, will lead to compliance
                                               with BS 7671.

              Appendix I   Resistance of       This appendix is used to calculate circuit resistances including R1 + R2 values for circuits.
                           copper and          There are three tables in this appendix, with Tables I2 and I3 complementing the main Table
                           aluminium           I1. The intended use of each table is:
                           cables              ●	 Table I1: to calculate the resistance of a circuit based on the csa of line and protective
                                                   conductors, as well as the conductor material. The values are given in milliohms per meter
                                                   of circuit at 20 °C.
                                               ●	 Table I2: this table provides factors that need to be applied to calculated values from
                                                   Table I1 when undertaking testing of a circuit at a temperature other than 20 °C to allow a
                                                   comparison of test data to calculated data.
                                               ●	 Table I3: this table provides factors to be applied to a calculated value of R1 + R2 from Table
                                                   I1 when designing a circuit, as this table corrects the value to circuit operating temperature
                                                   based on how the cpc interacts with the live conductors and the type of insulation around
                                                   the conductors.
                                               It must be noted that a common mistake made is the application of all three tables together
                                               and this must be avoided as:
                                               ●	 Table I1 and I2 are used when testing
                                               ●	 Table I1 and I3 are used when designing.

              Appendix J   Selection of        This appendix reproduces a table from Chapter 53 of BS 7671 which details the suitability of
                           devices for         different devices for the application of isolation, emergency switching and functional switching.

                           switching           knowledge of the related BS and BS EN numbers relating to the devices.
              Appendix K   Identification of   This appendix gives guidance on the correct methods used to identify conductors, based on a
                           conductors          conductor’s function and circuit type, such as single-phase, three-phase, AC, DC, etc.

            ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION




               INTRODUCTION
               When you are undertaking the installation of wiring systems and electrical equipment,
               it is important to make sure that you show good workmanship and adopt the correct standards right from the
               start. When working on site, you may see incorrect and unsafe practices.
               In this chapter, you will learn:
               l	 the tools that you are expected to know about and their functions
               l	 how to use these tools
               l	 some of the basic installation practices.

               This chapter will focus not just on domestic wiring techniques but also on some of those practices found in
               commercial and industrial types of installation.
               This chapter also introduces you to the fundamentals of proving that your installation has been installed
               correctly by performing necessary tests on the installation before a live supply is connected.
               This is essential as it helps to identify errors and omissions before putting people at risk.

            l	 Water level – this is used to ensure two points are at the same level, when they
               are perhaps on different walls or even in different rooms. Two water gauges are
               connected by a hose of any length. As water will maintain the same level, this
               ensures two points are at the same height.
            l	 Plumb line – this is normally used to see if something is installed on a perfect

               vertical line, but it can also be used to create a horizontal guide line. The cord
               can be coated in a chalk-like powder and then held firmly in place at either
               end. If it is stretched and allowed to snap back, it leaves a faint chalk line,
               which can be used as a reference for measurements.

            Installation hand tools
            After the initial marking out has been performed, installation work can start.
            Sometimes, the installation process can be split into two tasks:
            l	   fabrication and installation of containment systems
            l	   wiring.                                                                               p	 Figure 4.4 Plumb line

            Fabrication and assembly of the containment system uses tools that are designed
            for cutting metals and plastics.

            Hand saws
            There are various different types of hand saw used in our industry, and each has

              You do not need to get all the
              tools at once. Start off with
              the basic tools such as pliers,
              cutters, screwdrivers, knife
              and hammer. Later on, add a
              level, square, and so on. Tools
              are expensive, but if you buy
              good quality they will last a     p	Figure 4.6 Floorboard saw

              investigate the range of
              options available to you.
              Take care to buy quality
              tools, as sometimes cheaper
              alternatives may not have the
              same insulation properties.

            Like any other tool, a saw must be kept sharp and in good condition. Missing teeth
            can result in a bad cut or a weakened blade.
            The number and shape of teeth change according to the purpose of each type of
            saw. The number of teeth on a blade is referred to as the teeth per inch, or TPI;
            the softer the material that is being cut, the lower the TPI.
            When cutting through mild steel (such as conduit and trunking), the TPI must be
            about 24 to 32 – this is the type of blade fitted to most hacksaws. Missing teeth
            or a bent blade can result in the blade becoming jammed and then breaking, so it
            is important to inspect your blade prior to use.

            Files
            When working with any metal, you should remove all sharp edges and any
            rough bits, which are generally referred to as burrs. As with hand saws, there are          HEALTH AND SAFETY
            different types of file for different purposes.                                             Never use a file without

            Files are not just described by their shape or purpose. They are also identified by
            coarseness – some files remove a lot of metal but leave a rough finish and others
            remove less but leave a very smooth finish.
            The coarseness is identified as a grade of cut and the levels include:
            l	 very smooth (finishing cut)
            l	 smooth (dressing cut)
            l	 second cut

            l	 bastard

            l	 rough.

            As with any hand tool, it is important to make sure your cutting tool is safe to
            use. So, every file should be fitted with a handle which is secure and the faces
            should be kept clean with a stiff wire brush. Damaged or blocked teeth on the
            file will result in an uneven cut, which may cause slippage that results in injury
            to the user.

            Wire strippers
            Wire strippers provide a safe and reliable method of removing the insulation from
            a wire or cable without damaging the conductor. Wire strippers come in various
            designs, but the common principle is that the cutting jaws only cut into the
            insulating material and not into the conductor.




            p	 Figure 4.15 Wire strippers

            Wire strippers can be either manually set (by a screw or dial) or automatically set.
            Side cutters can also be used but these often damage the conductor.

            Cable cutters
            There are a variety of different tools that can be used to cut cables, the most
            common being side cutters. Side cutters are probably one of the most important
            tools that electricians have in their tool kit. These are used for cutting cables to
            length, cutting sleeving and cutting nylon tie-wraps, for example. They work on
            a compression-force basis and are shaped so that the cutting point is along one
            side.

                                              Depending on the size of the cutters, cable sizes up to 16 mm2 can be cut easily.
                                              However, larger cables require larger types of cutters. These range from cable
                                              loppers, up to hydraulic, manual pump cutters for cables up to 300 mm2.

                                              An electrician will use a selection of different sized screwdrivers. They will all have
                                              one thing in common in that they will all be of approved standards.
                                              The most common screwdrivers used include:

            folding blade. The most common use of the electrician’s knife is for stripping the     disposable knife blade
            outer sheaths of some cables; the blade generally has a shaped section to aid the      when stripping cables

            p	Figure 4.18 Electrician’s knives  (photo courtesy of Axminster Tool Centre Ltd.)

            An electrician’s knife should never be used for stripping the insulation from cables
            or for cutting cables to length. It should always be used pointing away from the
            body.

            Specialist tools
            Certain activities require tools that are specifically designed for the task and
            are only used for this task. For example, when working with steel conduit, it is
            necessary to use stocks and dies, along with reamers and engineer’s squares.
            These and other tools are explained later in the chapter.

            Some typical wrenches used in our industry include:
            l	 Pipe wrenches – the jaws on these wrenches are designed to fit around a
               selection of different nuts and bolts, and so they are ideal for tightening lock
               nuts and cable glands.
            l	 Footprints – some larger cables require glands that are in excess of 60 mm in

               diameter and these are often too big for a pipe wrench. Footprints can be set
               to larger sizes and are well suited for tightening these larger glands and nuts.
            l	 Bush spanners – when installing metal conduit, it is important to ensure that

               all connections are tight. Some of the assembly components are called bushes.
               These are often small and in positions that are not accessible to pipe wrenches
               and footprints. A bush spanner is designed to fit into these small areas,
               enabling the bush to be correctly tightened.                                         p	 Figure 4.21 Bush spanner
            It is important to select the correct wrench for the job and to set it to the correct
            size. Incorrect use can damage the nut or bolt being tightened.

                                                    The most common mistake that people make when using a hammer is that they
                                                    do not grip it at the correct place. The handle is designed to be gripped at a point
                                                    furthest away from the head of the hammer, enabling the full force to be applied.
                                                    If a hammer has a split or damaged handle, or shows signs of damage to the head,
                                                    it should not be used – it should be replaced immediately. Never hit the heads of
                                                    two hammers together as this may result in parts breaking off.

                                                    requirements into account. Ask yourself these questions:

            Drills
            There are several different types of drill that can be used in our industry for
            different tasks. It is important to recognise the best drill for the job, making sure it
            is safe to use.
            All drills have some common parts, such as a chuck and a bit (with some
            requiring a special tool called a chuck key to tighten and loosen the jaws of the
            chuck). In the past, the chuck key was often lost or misplaced, so some modern
            drills have a chuck that can be tightened by hand without the use of a special tool
            or key. It is important to make sure that, when securing a bit in the chuck, it is
            positioned straight and in the centre so that it does not wobble or come loose. For
            more about drill bits see pages 247–49.

                                                Electric hand drill
                                                This is the most common type of drill and can be mains powered from either
                                                230 V or 110 V AC, as well as being available in battery form. This drill is probably
                                                the most versatile as it is a general-purpose tool.
                                                The hand drill, as its name suggests, is portable and can be used in most
              KEY TERM                          positions. Consideration should be given to dust and swarf that may be generated

                         INDUSTRY TIP
              Only use drill bits that are
              sharp. Make sure the drill is
              turning in the right direction.

                                                The right-angled electric drill is a variation of the electric hand drill. This tool is
                                                often used when making alterations to an existing property and new holes need
                                                to be cut through the joists. The spacing of the joists often prevents access by a
                                                regular hand drill and so a right-angled drill is required.
                                                The chuck is positioned at right angles to the rest of the body of the drill, so the
                                                space required for access is only that of the chuck and drill bit. Generally, this is
                                                less than the spacing of the joists.

            Hammer drill
            For drilling into masonry walls or floors and ceilings, cutting is more efficient
            when accompanied by a controlled impact. This is achieved by the use of a
            hammer-action drill. Some electric hand drills have this option built in and it can
            be easily selected.
            When in hammer mode, the chuck is subjected to a set level of vibration which is
            transmitted to the drill bit. This helps the drill knock the bit into the masonry. This
            function must not be used when drilling through timber or steel as it will damage
            the drill bit as well as the material. Masonry drill bits (for use in hammer mode)
            are designed and built to withstand these stresses.

            Pillar drill
            Where drilling needs to be very accurate and consistent, a pillar drill is often used.
            The pillar drill has an adjustable table which can be positioned at various heights.
            The table is used to clamp the material to be drilled so that it does not move, so a
            hole can be drilled in a precise location.

            Drill bits
            A drill bit is the item that is positioned in the chuck to perform the cutting
            process. Bits come in various shapes and sizes according to the material to be cut.
            When drill bits are used for cutting the wrong material they can become blunt,
            very hot and damaged.
            When a drill bit becomes blunt, it is tempting to press down harder on the drill
            to make the bit cut. This increases the risk of injury – the bit could shatter. In
            addition, a blunt drill bit can become so hot that it melts, further increasing the
            risk of injury.
                                                                                                      	 Figure 4.26 Pillar drill

                                                    All drill bits are designed to cut in a clockwise direction. If a reversible drill is used,
                                                    care should be taken to ensure correct rotation. A drill bit should never be run in

                                                    As the name suggests this is a saw bit for cutting holes. There are two types: one
                                                    for wood and the other for steel. Both types fit onto an arbor which holds the saw
                                                    in place. The arbor is fitted with a pilot drill to make sure the saw acts around a

                                                    Metal drill bits are sometimes referred to as HSS (high-speed steel) bits. These are

                                                    such as metal carbide, to make them resistant to wear.
                                                    The cutting face on an HSS bit is straight and there are two parts. A sharp HSS bit
                                                    should look like a figure 8, when viewed from the cutting end. The cutting faces
                                                    are set at an angle from the horizontal and the back of the face should be lower
                                                    than the front, to ensure only the cutting edge is in contact with the material
                                                    being cut. If the back edge of the cutting face is too high, it will rub against the
                                                    material, causing excess heat and stopping the cutting by the drill bit.

                                              and safety. In general terms, PUWER require that equipment which is provided for
                                              work activities is:
                                              l	 suitable for the intended use
                                              l	 safe for use and maintained in a safe condition

                                              l	 used only by people that have received training on how to use the equipment

                                                 correctly and safely
                                              l	 accompanied by suitable safety measures, such as guards, marking and

                                              It is the responsibility of both the employer providing the tool and the employee
                                              using the tool to check the equipment is safe, appropriate for the job and used
                                              correctly.
                                              Most plug-in power tools on a construction site are supplied from a 110 V

                                              for connection. The reason for the colour coding on the plug-and-socket
              BS EN 60309 plugs and
                                              arrangement is to ensure that the operator knows what voltage is required and
              sockets are often referred to
                                              available. The colours of the plugs and sockets used under BS EN 60309 are:
              as commando sockets and
              plugs.                          l	 purple – this is used on voltages below 50 V AC
                                              l	 yellow – this is used on 110 V AC centre-tapped sources

                                              l	 blue – this is used on 230 V AC standard single-phase supplies

                                              l	 red – this is used on 400 V AC three-phase supplies.

                                              As well as the colour coding, plugs and sockets have notches and bumps
                                              called keys which limit their connection. So, it is not possible to plug a piece of
                                              110 V equipment into either a 230 V or 400 V supply. If a BS EN 60309 plug
                                              has been cut off and replaced with a standard BS 1363 13 A three-pin plug,
                                              you should not use the equipment and should bring it to the attention of your
                                              supervisor.

            Section 704 in BS 7671 provides further information regarding the installation
            requirements for temporary power supplies and installations to be used by site
            workers during the construction stage.
            Hazards associated with the use of electric power tools are shown in the table.

              Hazard                 Source
              Impalement             If the bit of a hand drill is of the wrong type or blunt, the operator
                                     may be tempted to push too hard. Should the drill bit snap it may
                                     injure the operator.
              Particles in the eye   When cutting wood, metal or other material with a power tool,
                                     debris such as wood splinters and swarf can be thrown up. If
                                     the operator is not wearing suitable eye protection they may get
                                     particles in the eye. Brick dust can cause severe damage, even
                                     blindness.
              Electric shock         Power tools that are plugged into the mains are more likely to
                                     cause electric shocks than battery-operated ones. Some people
                                     do not realise the purpose of the protective device in a plug and
                                     may try to by-pass it if it keeps tripping or ‘blowing’. They do not
                                     appreciate that the device is there to keep them safe in the event
                                     of an electrical fault.

                                     Damaged leads, plugs and equipment casings can lead to
                                     electric shock. If a tool is not suitable for the particular work
                                     environment, this increases the risk of an incident happening.
                                     Only power tools designed for construction sites should be used
                                     on construction sites.


            Working at height
            Working at height is obviously hazardous in itself and can compound hazards
            associated with the activity being performed.
            The Work at Height Regulations 2005 were outlined, along with clarification of
            what working at height entails, on pages 45–48. The regulations apply when a
            person is working at any level, where if they fell from that level, they could be
            injured. Working on ladders or steps is a common feature of working at height,
            but this could also include working at ground level near an excavation.

            Ladders
            The HSE provides guidance for working on steps and ladders. Essentially, ladders
            should only be used as a means of access or where the work activity lasts for a
            short period of time typically not longer than 30 minutes and only for light loads
            not exceeding 10 kg mass.

                                                Ladders come in various forms including:
                                                l	   wooden
                                                l	   aluminium

                                                l	   double extension
                                                l	   triple extension.

                                                Inspection of ladders
                     INDUSTRY TIPS              Each ladder should carry a unique identification mark which is recorded on the
              Even if a ladder is destroyed,    company ladder register. The ladder register is used to record each ladder, along

                                                When using a ladder it is good practice to ensure that:
                                                l	   it is placed on a firm and level surface
                                                l	   the top and bottom of the ladder are secured or footed

              before using a wooden

                                                foot on the bottom rung to make sure it stays in place and does not move.
              HEALTH AND SAFETY                 When climbing a stepladder, both hands should be used and the user should face

                                              The risk assessment
                                              Unless the various hazards are controlled and managed, working in the electrical
                                              installation business can be very dangerous. If people are not aware of the hazards
                                              around them, the risks increase. Everyone should be aware of the hazards and
                                              risks involved in the workplace. A risk assessment enables risks and hazards to be
                                              identified. Action plans are then put in place to prevent the risk from becoming a
                                              reality.
                                              Most companies have standard risk assessments for the more routine work
                                              activities, such as use of hand tools and power tools, but it is important to
                                              understand that hazards and risks change depending on the circumstances of the
                                              individual job. Sadly, some companies perceive performing risk assessments as a
                                              necessary health and safety chore, rather than a business tool to help them plan
                                              and improve working processes. A lot of risk assessments are written and then
                                              stored away in a file on a shelf somewhere within the company. This is not the
                                              correct use of a risk assessment – it is intended to be a ‘live’ document which is
                                              constantly updated.
                                              The HSE defines a risk assessment as a careful examination of what, in terms
                                              of work, could cause harm to people, so that precautions can be put in place to
                                              prevent that harm. Workers (and others) have a right to be protected from harm
                                              caused by a failure to take reasonable control measures.
                                              There are five steps to a risk assessment:
              HEALTH AND SAFETY
              Remember that a                 1	   identify the hazard
              risk assessment is a            2	   assess who might be harmed and how

              work progresses.                5	   monitor, evaluate and update as required.
                                              Risk assessment is a continual process, because circumstances are constantly
                                              changing. Therefore, although the five steps are shown as a list above, the process
                                              tends to be more of a cycle in practice (Figure 4.36). Pages 25–28 in Chapter 1
                                              give full details of how to carry out a risk assessment.

                                               ACTIVITY
                                               When assessing the potential for harm, different locations may change the risk.
                                               A simple task, such as changing a lamp, needs to be carried out. Consider how
                                               this task differs where the lamp is in the following situations/locations:
                                               l	 in a bus shelter

                                               l	 in a 4 m high street light on a busy road

                                               l	 above a furnace in a factory.

                                                   able to read drawings correctly. Standardised symbols are used for drawings in the
                                                   electrotechnical industry. These symbols can be used to identify components and
                                                   their locations.
                                                   The layout drawing is generally a plan view with a legend or key to clarify the
                                                   types of components to be installed and their locations. Most designers use
                                                   IEC 60617 symbols, but as the full range of symbols for this type of drawing are
                                                   not covered by this standard, the designer may use their own variations. You must
                                                   clarify with the designer any symbols that are not easily recognisable.

                                                   Some of the common symbols are shown on the inside cover of the Institution
                                                   of Engineering and Technology (IET) On-Site Guide, but they are not explained.
                                                   However, the IET On-Site Guide is a good memory jogger when looking at the
                                                   drawings for an electrical installation.
                                                   Most of the symbols used in BS EN 60617 are made up of parts that have
                                                   different meanings. Designers can add parts together to make a symbol for a
                                                   component, should there be no symbol for what they are designing. Consider the
                                                   light switch symbols shown In Figures 4.37 to 4.41.
                                                   When you consider a switch, you have to consider what the switch does. This

               switching action. As an example, if a switch operates both a line and neutral, it

            The circle in the plan symbol indicates that the device is a switch. The arm that
            sticks out of the circle shows how many ways this switch can operate. The flag at
            the end of the arm indicates the number of poles that the switch operates. The
            number of gangs is indicated by a number or letter (e.g. 2 for two-gang or M for
            multi-gang).

            Some multi-gang switches, often used in industrial and commercial installations,
            can have as many as 12 switches on the same faceplate! This type of multi-gang
            switch is normally called a grid switch (Figures 4.40 and 4.41) and is of a modular
            construction and would need to be assembled on site; generally all the parts are
            ordered separately.

                                               Now you have looked at light switches and their symbols, you will find it easier to
                                               interpret other symbols – when a symbol has an arm with a flag on it (similar to
                                               that seen on the light switch examples) you know it is showing an accessory that
                                               can be switched. For example, Figures 4.42 and 4.43 show a non-switched socket
                                               outlet and a switched socket outlet.
                                               For many pieces of electrical equipment, there is no dedicated symbol. Therefore, a
                                               lot of generic symbols are used. For example, a square identifies a piece of electrical
                                               equipment. When the square contains, for example, a figure 8 or infinity sign, the
                                               symbol indicates an electric fan. Always look at the key or legend of the plan to
                                               double check the meaning of the symbols used by the designer.

              sometimes the switch stick
              extends into the dome.

                                               Drawing scales
                                               The drawings may show the proposed cable routes that the installer is expected
                                               to follow. Using this information, it is possible to approximate the length of cable
                                               required.
                                               All drawings and plans are produced to scale, to enable accurate measurements to
                                               be made. A scale is simply a ratio that is used to represent life-size structures at
                                               a smaller size. The ratio is generally expressed as two numbers and typical scales
                                               are:
                                               l	 1:20
                                               l	 1:50
                                               l	 1:100

                                               l	 1:500.

                                               So, in the case of the third scale ratio above (1:100), one unit on the plan represents
                                               100 life-size units. To apply the scale, make a measurement on the drawing and then
                                               multiply this by the second number in the ratio; this will give you the measurement in
                                               reality. An alternative method is to use a scaled rule with the same scale ratio as the
                                               plan. This will show the correct measurement. For example, on a scaled rule with a
                                               scale of 1:100, a measurement of 1 cm is shown as 1 m (100 cm).

            Drawing dimensions
            The correct positioning of materials is important. When a component must be
            fitted in a certain location, the layout drawing will give a measurement indicating
            where the component is to be installed. These measurements are generally
            referred to as dimensions and can be shown in one of two ways:
            l	   datum form                                     l	   linear form.
            Datum dimensioning is used where several accessories need to be installed at
            different heights and with varied spacing between them. A common start point,
            the datum, is identified and the dimensions are all measured from there. The
            common point may be the corner of a room or another fixed point, such as a
            piece of switch-gear.

                                               common practice to use:

                                               l	 a straight edge
                                               l	 a long or short level

                                               l	 and a plumb line.

                                               Marking out on a finished wall should be kept to a minimum, as unsightly marks
                                               have to be removed after the work is completed. Faint pencil marks (that are
                                               clear enough to be seen for installation purposes only) should be used. Faint
                                               marks are easier to remove if necessary. A useful tool at this stage is a laser level;
                                               this projects a level line over a long distance. However, not all construction sites
                                               permit the use of laser levels due to health and safety concerns.
                                               On an unfinished wall that needs chasing, it is important to make the marking out
                                               clear; often the part of the wall to be removed is indicated by hatching the area.
                                               This is when diagonal lines are drawn across the part of the wall to be cut away.
                                               Figure 4.46 shows how a wall may be marked out for a builder to chase out for
                                               electrical wiring. Additional information, such as the depth of the chase, may also
                                               be advised, but builders generally work to the maximum permissible depth as

            If Part M applies, electrical accessories must be installed on walls in a zone which
            is from 450 mm to 1200 mm, measured from the finished floor level (as detailed
            in Section 8 of the approved document M of the Building Regulations).
            So, if you are installing within a new dwelling, these heights must be observed.
            However, if the building is an existing dwelling and the new switch or socket
            outlet is an addition or alteration to an existing circuit, there is no need to comply
            with part M if the building did not already comply with it. Another exclusion
            is a socket outlet for a dedicated piece of equipment, such as a wall-mounted
            television, which you would not expect to unplug and plug in continually. If this is
            the case, the height restrictions do not apply as they focus on the general-purpose
            socket outlets.
            Think about the purpose of a ground-floor conversion or extension when wiring. If
            the extension or conversion is for a person with disabilities, consideration should
            be given to the application of the minimum and maximum heights.

                                                      conduit, trunking or ducting, for example.

                                                   Conduit systems
                                                   In some environments, the installation may be subjected to external influences
                                                   which may cause damage to the wiring. Damage could result, for example, from
                                                   impact or corrosion from oils and other solutions. A common method of providing
                                                   an additional level of mechanical protection from such damage is the use of
                                                   conduit.
                                                   Conduit is available in both steel and PVC and comes in many different forms
                                                   including:
                                                   l	   solid steel extruded
                                                   l	   solid steel rolled
                                                   l	   rigid PVC
                                                   l	   flexible steel
                                                   l	   flexible PVC.
                                                   Both steel and PVC conduits come in both light gauge and heavy gauge, providing
                                                   a degree of flexibility with regards to application and cost. Conduits come in a
                                                   variety of finishes: PVC is available in various colours and steel can be galvanised
                                                   or brushed, or finished in black enamel.
                                                   Solid steel extruded conduit is seamless (there is no join). This makes it an
                                                   expensive option and it is only used for special gas-tight, explosion-proof or
                                                   flame-proof installations. Conduit is typically supplied in 3 m or 3.75 m lengths
                                                   and, unlike pipework for water and gas services, is identified by the overall
                                                   external diameter.
                                                   Typical conduit external diameters are 16 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm and 32 mm,
                                                   though it can be supplied in sizes up to and including 63 mm.
                                                   Flexible conduit is predominately used in short runs as the level of mechanical
                                                   protection is greatly reduced by the need for movement. A typical application for
                                                   flexible conduit is in the final run of containment from wall-mounted conduit to a
                                                   machine which vibrates, such as a motor.

            Advantages of conduit
            One of the main advantages of using conduit is the increased mechanical
            protection that is afforded by the containment. Flexible conduit offers the least
            level of mechanical protection, followed by PVC conduit, with steel conduit
            providing the highest level of mechanical protection.
            Other advantages of using conduit include the ability to perform rewiring
            relatively easily, providing all cables are being replaced at the same time – cables
            should all be drawn into the conduit at the same time and not pulled past one
            another. BS 7671 Regulation 522.8 states that cables should not be subjected to
            stress, strain or damage during installation, maintenance or use.
            Using steel conduit in an installation can minimise the risk of spread of fire,
            providing all joints, fittings and accessories are constructed to a minimum of IP33.
            Another benefit of steel conduit is the fact that steel conducts electrical energy.
            The conduit can be used as the circuit protective conductor (cpc), provided it is of
            a suitable size. BS 7671 Regulation 543.1.1 explains how to establish whether the
            conduit is big enough to act as the circuit protective conductor.
            Although steel conduit is rarely used as a sole protective conductor, steel conduit
            may act as a protective conductor when installed buried in a wall to satisfy the
            requirements of Regulation group 522.6 of BS 7671, or when acting as a high
            integrity protective conductor on circuits having high protective conductor
            currents.

            Disadvantages of conduit
            The first disadvantage of using conduit is cost. The time and materials required to
            install a conduit system are often far greater than that needed to install the cables
            directly (clipped direct) in the fabric of the building or onto the surface of the
            building. It is important, therefore, to establish the need for mechanical protection
            prior to installing.
            PVC conduit is directly affected by UV rays and can become discoloured and
            brittle in direct sunlight. In addition, PVC expands a lot if it gets hot. It becomes
            very brittle if subjected to temperatures below 4 °C and can become very soft if
            subjected to temperatures above 60 °C.
            Steel conduit can also be affected by acids, alkalis and corrosive fumes; it is
            particularly susceptible to rust from moisture which can form on the inside of the
            conduit.
            Steel conduit has one big disadvantage that PVC conduit does not; eddy currents
            can form in it.

                                              When a current passes along a conductor, a moving magnetic field forms around
                                              it. If a single current-carrying conductor is placed within a steel conduit, the
                                              moving magnetic field can induce an electromotive force, e.m.f., in the steel
                                              conduit. This induced e.m.f. can create an eddy current which, in turn, can produce
                                              heat as well as the potential for electric shock. Therefore, BS 7671 Regulation
                                              521.5.1 states that, when a circuit is carrying AC current, all circuit conductors
                                              must pass through the same conduit. This means that no run of steel conduit has
                                              just one line or neutral conductor running through it.

                                              Accessories
                                              Steel and PVC conduits use some common accessories in their installations, but
                         INDUSTRY TIP         they also have their own specific accessories.

              referred to as besa
              (pronounced ‘beezer’) boxes.    There are various forms of box that are used in the construction of a conduit

                                              You will learn to fabricate your own bends during assembly. However, pre-
                                              manufactured bends and elbows are also available and they tend to be one of two
                                              types:

                                              Inspection joints are usually preferred as these allow the cables to be drawn in
                                              easily during installation. However, if the bend is on a short run and within 0.5 m

            Whatever type of bend you use, bear in mind compliance with BS 7671
            Regulation 522.8.6 (you need to ensure that the cables are not subjected to
            excessive strain or stress during installation by providing adequate means of
            access to perform the drawing in of cables). So, if inspection joints are not used,
            there must be adequate alternative access points along the conduit run. These can
            be provided by accessory boxes, such as through boxes on long runs.

            Joining components
            Conduit is available in standard lengths of 3 m and 3.75 m; often runs need to be
            joined. The basic method of joining two runs of conduit together is by use of a
            coupler.
            The coupler that is used on PVC conduit is a piece of tube that has a larger
            diameter than that of the conduit. The conduit is simply slotted into either side
            of the coupler and secured in place with adhesive. Note that, under COSHH
            Regulations, the adhesive that is used in the joining of PVC conduit must be
            recorded on the National Poison Centre records; this should be done by the
            supplier or wholesaler selling the adhesive.
            In a long run, PVC must be able to expand and contract. When the run of PVC
            conduit is 5 m or longer, an expansion coupler must be used.
            This is similar to a normal PVC conduit coupler but is twice the length and                      INDUSTRY TIP
            adhesive is only used on one side, allowing the other side to move in and out of
            the coupler. It is important to ensure the level of penetration is correct, allowing      You can see that it is
            for contraction without leaving the coupler and expansion without buckling.               essential that metal conduit
                                                                                                      joints are tight. This not only
            Steel conduit also uses couplers but the use of adhesive is not permitted. All
                                                                                                      ensures good continuity,
            joints in steel conduit must be tight and electrically sound, so that if one part did     but prevents the conduit
            become live, the installation would still be connected to earth and the protective        becoming loose.
            devices would operate.
            To achieve this, the coupler is slightly larger than the conduit and there is a thread
            all the way through the inside of the coupler. This means that, once a thread is
            cut on both pieces of the conduit to be joined, the components can be screwed
            together.
            In some joints it is necessary to have the thread on the outside and this is called a
            nipple. A nipple has the same size external diameter as the conduit, and the thread
            is cut along its length. It is normally about the same length as a coupler and can
            be connected with a coupler.

            Erection components
            There are various different ways of securing conduit to walls. If the conduit is
            to be covered by plaster, it is common for a crampet to be used to secure the
            conduit temporarily in place. This looks like a bent-over floorboard nail.               p	 Figure 4.60 Crampet
            When the conduit is to be installed on the surface, it is common to use a type of
            saddle to hold it in place. All of the saddles shown here are available for PVC and
            steel conduits.

                                                  the conduit. The hospital saddle has no horizontal edges for dirt and dust to
                                                  accumulate and also moves the conduit away from the wall, just far enough to
                                                  make cleaning possible. As its name suggests, these are used in some areas of
                                                  hospitals, but they are also suitable for use in commercial kitchens, along with
                                                  stainless steel conduit.

              The spacer bar stamp
              normally has a keyhole slot to
              allow one-handed fitting. The

                                               The saddles used on PVC conduit can be different to those for steel conduit. Some
                                               do not need screws to fix the saddle part to the back-plate.

                                               Bushes
                                               For steel conduit there are two types of bush, both of which are made of brass.
                                               These are:
                                               l	 Male bush – this has the thread on the outside and it is used to thread into a
                                                  coupler or accessory.
                                               l	 Female bush – this has the thread on the inside and is used where the

                                                  thread on the conduit protrudes into an accessory and the cable needs to be
                                                  protected from the rough edges.
                                               For PVC conduit, the bushes are combined with the adaptors for securing the
                                               conduit. There are two types of bush and adaptor combination:
                                               l	 Male adaptor – this uses a part similar to the brass male bush used on steel
                                                  conduit assemblies and screws into the adaptor.
                                               l	 Female adaptor – this uses a part similar to a lock ring and screws onto a

                                                  thread already on the adaptor.

            Sizing of conduit
            When you are installing conduit, consider the fact that the cables will get hot and
            need to be able to cool, to avoid overheating. There must be sufficient air space
            around the cables.
            The maximum fill capacity for conduit allows for air flow around the conductors.       ACTIVITY
            Appendix E of the IET On-Site Guide has standard tables giving the number of           Calculate how many
            conductors that can be installed in a piece of conduit, taking into account all the    4 mm2 PVC insulated
            relevant factors. The tables take into account the size and type of conductors, the    cables may be installed in
                                                                                                   a 25 mm conduit 5 m long,
            length of the conduit run and how many bends there are in the run (see Chapter 3,      with two bends.
            pages 212–214).
            To use Appendix E, follow this simple and logical approach:
            1	 Identify all the different sizes of wiring conductors used.
            2	 Identify the quantities of each different size.
            3	 Using the tables in Appendix E, select the correct cable factor for each size of
               cable.
            4	 Multiply the factor by the number of conductors of that size.
            5	 Add the totals together.
            6	 Select the conduit with the next factor up from the total value.


              EXAMPLE
              An easy way to follow these steps is to use a simple table, filling in the data
              as you go. The example below is a conduit sizing calculation for three lighting
              circuits and one ring final circuit, wired using solid copper thermoplastic cables
              in a run of 2.5 m. The steel conduit is to be used as the protective conductor for
              each circuit.

              Example of a conduit sizing calculation
              The calculation gives an overall conduit factor of 318. Again, using the
              appropriate table in Appendix E of the IET On-Site Guide, it can be seen that a
              piece of 20 mm conduit can be used as it has a spacing factor in excess of the
              318 required.
              However, if, after checking BS 7671 Regulation 543.1.1, you discovered that
              20 mm conduit did not have sufficient area to act as the protective conductor,
              you would have to repeat the calculation allowing additional circuit protective
              conductors for each circuit.

                                              Preparation for conduit installation
                                              When installing any form of conduit system, it is important to plan the route
                                              effectively and accurately. This often involves positioning accessories in their
                                              appropriate locations and using chalk to project straight lines for the conduit to
                                              follow.
                                              With the chalk lines in place, the saddles can be positioned along the run to aid
                                              with the erection and measurement process. The IET On-Site Guide provides
                                              guidance, in Appendix D, on the maximum distance between saddles – this is
                                              dependent on the size and type of conduit.

                                              Conduit systems are rarely an exact copy of their dimensioned drawings, as
                                              buildings are not often built exactly to the planned dimensions. Marking out the
                                              proposed route helps to establish the exact measurements of the conduit system.
                                              Once all the accessories and saddles are in place, it is possible to commence
                                              building the conduit system.

                                              Cutting of conduit
                                              Cutting PVC conduit is easier than cutting steel conduit; conduit cutters for PVC
                                              conduit are readily available and come in several forms. These include the snip
                                              style of conduit cutter and the ringing tool style. Both of these tools will cut the
                                              conduit, leaving a clean edge on the end with no burrs and minimal deformation
                                              of the conduit shape.
                                              Steel conduit is not so easy to cut and typically a hacksaw is used. Ideally, a
                                              hacksaw blade should be between 24 and 32 TPI for cutting steel conduit. Other
                                              tools that you will require include:
                                              l	   graphite pencil for marking out
                                              l	   tape measure
                                              l	   engineer’s square
                                              l	   hand file (generally second cut grade)
                                              l	   pipe vice
                                              l	   conduit reamer
                                              l	   appropriate signs and obstacles for making sure the work area is
                                                   cordoned off.
                                              The pipe vice is generally mounted on the tool that is used for bending the steel
                                              conduit, called a conduit bender. The pipe vice jaws must be well maintained
                                              and clean, or they will damage the conduit. If the vice is mounted on the conduit
                                              bender, the conduit may be at an angle, not necessarily horizontal.
                                              Having established how long the conduit should be, measure and mark the
                                              conduit using the tape measure and pencil, remembering to allow for 15 mm of
                                              thread at each end.
                                              Position the conduit in the pipe vice, allowing sufficient space to perform the cut
                                              but ensuring the cut will be close to the vice, so that the conduit does not vibrate
                                              excessively while being cut. If the conduit does vibrate too much during cutting,
                                              the hacksaw blade can become jammed, damaged or broken.

            Stand square to the job and make sure your movement is unobstructed. Position
            the blade next to the mark (on the piece of conduit not required) and grip the
            hacksaw lightly, applying light pressure on the forward cutting stroke. Use the full
            length of the blade to cut, as this helps to ensure that the blade does not overheat
            and become jammed in the cut.
            Once the cut has been performed, there will be rough and sharp edges on the
            outside and on the inside of the conduit. You should never insert your finger into
            the conduit to check for rough edges. To remove these rough edges, position the
            required conduit in the pipe vice. Stand square to the conduit. Use a hand file and,
            with one hand on the file handle and the other hand supporting the file at the
            other end, draw the file across the cut end of the conduit.
            Repeat this until the face of the conduit is smooth and square. To check to see if
            the face is square to the length of conduit, use an engineer’s square. Once the end
            of the conduit is square, use a hand file to remove the rough burrs on the outside
            edge.
            This time the file must be held at an angle of around 40° to the face. Draw the file
            across the sharp edge, slowly working around the end of the conduit, to create a
            slight chamfer. This chamfer will aid with cutting the thread later.
            Once the outer sharp edges and burrs have been removed, the inner burrs must
            also be removed (these could damage the cables as they are installed). You will
            sometimes see people doing this with a round file but the correct tool to use is
            a reamer. The reamer is like an oversized drill bit, but it is designed to be inserted
            into the conduit and rotated by hand until all the sharp edges have been removed.        p	 Figure 4.65 Conduit in pipe vice

            Threading conduit
            Once a piece of steel conduit has been sawn to length, it is necessary to cut a
            thread for the accessory to be mounted on the conduit. The pipe vice is used, and
            to cut the thread you will also need:
            l	 a set of stocks and dies
            l	 some cutting compound

            l	 a soft wire brush.

            Before cutting the thread, you need to check the die and make sure it is clean and
            clear of swarf. If the die is not clean it can damage the thread to be cut. The stock     HEALTH AND SAFETY

                                              With the end of the conduit covered in cutting compound, slide the stock and die
                                              set over the end, making sure that the guide slides on first. Stand square to the
                                              end of conduit and grip the stocks and, using the heals of both hands, press the
                                              die onto the end of the conduit. Rotate your hands in a slow clockwise direction,
                                              allowing the die to bite into the conduit.
                                              Once the die has started to cut, change your hand movement to a push and pull
                                              rotation, and steadily turn the handles through 180°. Repeat this once or twice
                                              and then turn the handles in an anticlockwise direction for just half a turn. You
                                              will feel a bit of resistance and then the die will come loose. This helps clear the
                                              swarf so the die does not jam or overheat.
                                              Repeat this process slowly and steadily. If you rush you will cause the die to
                                              overheat and the thread will be damaged. Remember, a superior thread can be cut
                                              by using a little care and patience.
                                              Repeat the process of two to three turns forward and then half a turn back until
                                              two whole threads protrude from the back of the stock and die. Once you have
                                              reached this point, slowly unscrew the stock and die from the conduit, again
                                              taking care not to damage the thread. It is tempting to try to spin the stocks and
                                              die off the conduit, but this can cause the die to wobble and damage part of the
                                              thread.
                                              Once the stock and die have been removed from the conduit, make sure the
                                              thread is clean and clear of all swarf. Use a soft wire brush (and safety glasses in
                                              case the residue flicks up towards your eyes). With all the swarf removed, use a
                                              rag to clean away any excess cutting compound.
                                              The stock and die set should be cleaned in preparation for their next use. Some
                                              people do this by banging the tool against the leg of the conduit bender. However,
                                              this can result in damage to both the bender and the stock and die set.
                                              In the absence of the tool’s correct cleaning brush, a stiff bristle bottle brush makes
                                              a suitable alternative. Again making sure your eyes (and the eyes of those around
                                              you) are protected, simply push the brush into the die and then withdraw. Repeat
                                              this process twice, leaving the die clean and ready for future use.
                                              Before removing the conduit from the vice, check the thread is even and
                                              undamaged throughout. You can screw on a coupler to protect the thread if you
              ACTIVITY                        are not ready to screw on the accessory.
              What are the common             When you have to cut a longer thread, it is important not to let the stocks and die
              sizes of dies used for
              threading conduit?
                                              overheat. To help, you can reduce the number of forward turns to one or two half
                                              turns forwards for every half turn back.

                                              Using a running coupler
                                              As mentioned earlier, once you have cut your thread, you normally thread on the
                                              accessory. To do this, you have to be able to turn one piece, if not both pieces,
                                              of conduit and the accessory. In some circumstances this is not possible – for
                                              example, if alterations are being made to a conduit system with bends that can
                                              not be dismantled sufficiently to turn it.

            In this instance, the conduit to be added is built and then joined to the existing
            assembly using a running coupler. A running coupler is a type of joint that uses:
            l	 a coupler
            l	 a lock nut or ring

            l	 (and sometimes) a nipple.

            A thread must be cut on the conduit to be added that is long enough to thread
            on both the lock nut or ring and then the coupler. When connecting into an
            accessory, a nipple must be threaded into the accessory so that half the thread is
            sticking out. Then the new part of the conduit assembly is offered up to the nipple
            and the coupler is unscrewed from the conduit. For joining to a second piece of
            conduit rather than to an accessory, the nipple is not required; the conduit already
            has another thread to accept the coupler.
            As the coupler is unscrewed, it threads onto the second thread so that it can be
            threaded tightly onto either the accessory or conduit while still being threaded
            onto the new piece of conduit. To stop this from coming loose, a lock nut or ring is
            tightened up behind the coupler to hold it in place.
            Once in place, the exposed thread must be painted to stop it from corroding. The
            paint used must complement the conduit finish, for example black enamel.

            Bends
            Though there is a wide selection of pre-manufactured bends and accessories, you
            also need to be able to bend conduit to meet specific circumstances.
            Bending conduit is more about technique than brute force. It is vital that you
            know how to bend the conduit in the correct place. Sometimes people bend the
            conduit and then cut it to size; this not only creates excess waste, but also takes
            longer as it creates more work.
            Before we look at how to bend conduit, we will study the names of different
            bends. These include:
            l	   The set – sometimes referred to as a ‘dog-leg’, this consists of two bends, each
                 of about 45°, on top of one another with one bend going one way and the
                 other in the reverse direction. It is used to bring the conduit out further from
                 the surface that it has been running on and is common at distribution panels
                 and other switchgear.

                                              l	 The kick – this is similar to the set, but only has one bend at an angle up to
                                                 45°. This is normally used when a conduit runs up a wall and along the roof
                                                 structure, such as along a rafter.
                                              l	 The bubble set – sometimes referred to as a ‘camel’ set, this is normally used

                                                 when there is no other option but to run a conduit over another conduit or
                                                 pipe. The two conduits (or conduit and pipe) should not come into direct
                                                 contact, and the centre of the bubble should be directly above the centreline of
                                                 the underlying structure. There should be a minimum of a finger-gap clearance
                                                 behind the top conduit, but no more clearance than the diameter of the
                                                 conduit itself.

                                              l	   The 90° bend – this is probably the most common of the bends as conduit
                         INDUSTRY TIP              often goes around corners of about 90°. Note that very few buildings have
                                                   exact 90° corners, so the bends must be sized to fit.
              A door frame is a useful test
              piece when bending conduit.
              The door frame should have a
              90° internal angle.

                                                   and over an overhang at the top. It is not a very common bend. Because of the
            p	 Figure 4.70 Swan-neck bend          shape of the bend, it can be difficult to remove it from the conduit bender.

            The conduit bender
            Though there are many different types of conduit benders, they all have similar
            components and work in a similar manner. Learning how to bend conduit using a
            bender can save time and money – bending conduit is quicker than cutting and
            applying a thread to use a manufactured bend.

            p	 Figure 4.71 View of a conduit bender (with part of the frame removed for clarity)

            All steel conduit benders have some key components and in the illustration above,
            the following items can be seen:
            1	 the roll bar, where the pressure is applied to bend the conduit and which has
               several holes for the different size conduits
            2	 the roller, which sits within the roll bar and can be positioned in the relevant
               hole depending on the size of conduit to be bent
            3	 the former, which is sized to ensure that the minimum bend radius of 2.5 times
               the conduit diameter is achieved
            4	 the stop bar, which consists of a bar with several holes giving different
               positions for the different size conduits, and the stop used for holding the
               conduit in place while it is bent.
            The conduit bender is designed so that the former can be changed and so that the
            position of the stop and roller can be altered to suit different sizes of conduit. It is
            important to make sure the former is in place and the correct positions for stop
            and roller are selected before attempting to bend any conduit.
            All conduit benders are built to bend downwards, but when bends have runs of
            over 1 m on either side, the conduit can be fouled by the floor. Therefore, most
            conduit benders have the ability to bend conduit upwards with the stop bar and
                                                                                                                                 277

                                                 the equipment to bend upwards, make sure you have sufficient clearance above
                                                 the conduit bender!

                                                 Making a 90° bend
                                                 Bending a piece of conduit requires good technique. To reduce waste, make sure
                                                 you get it right first time! Some people bend the conduit and then cut it to size,
                                                 but this can result in more work and a longer process as two threads must be cut.

            p	 Figure 4.72 How to measure        In order to avoid this, use a method called ‘measuring to the back of bend’ (Figure
               for a back of bend                4.72). First, measure the distance from the conduit or accessory that will accept
                                                 the bent piece, to the far side of the conduit saddle where the conduit will be after
                                                 the bend, as shown opposite.
                                                 Use this dimension to mark a pencil line on the piece of conduit. The conduit is
                                                 then inserted into the bender from the former side and rested under the stop bar.
                                                 Using an off-cut of the same size of conduit and an engineer’s square, move the
                                                 conduit until the pencil mark lines up with the back of the off-cut, making sure
                                                 both parts remain square, as shown in the diagram.
                                                 With the conduit now in place, remove the engineer’s square and the off-cut and
                                                 use the roll bar to bend the conduit around the former. You can use one hand on
                                                 the conduit to aid with the bend; this reduces the pressure on the roll bar and,
            p	 Figure 4.73 How to position the   therefore, reduces the potential for damage to the finished conduit. It is important
               conduit at the right point for    to apply a steady constant pressure and not to swing on the roll bar. Bending your
               bending                           knees as you pull the roll bar can also assist with the bend.
                                                 When the roll bar is sticking out horizontally, the conduit bend is about 45°; when
              ACTIVITY                           the roll bar is parallel with the front legs, the bend is about 90° (Figure 4.73).
              What is the minimum                Remember that the conduit will spring back a little when the pressure is removed,
              internal radius of bend            so it is important to check the angle visually. This is done by standing side-on to
              for 16 mm, 25 mm and               the bend and squatting down so your eyes are level with the bend. It is tempting
              32 mm conduit? (Answer
              in mm.)
                                                 just to turn your head to see the angle of the bend, but if your eyes are not
                                                 horizontal then it will be harder to see if the bend is correct.
                                                 It is possible to remove the conduit from the bender to check its shape against its
                                                 intended location. To increase the bend, the conduit can be repositioned easily in
                                                 the conduit bender without having to measure everything again.
                                                 Though it is possible to correct bends that have been bent too far, this should be
                                                 avoided as it weakens the conduit and can cause damage. So, take your time and do
                                                 it right first time. Should you have to correct a bend that has been bent too far, you
                                                 should position the conduit in the bender in the opposite direction and correct using
                                                 just your hands (not the roll bar) as this will give you a better idea of how far it has
                                                 bent.

                                                 A set
                                                 There are two types of set: one with angles of 30° and 60°, and the other with
                                                 angles of 45° each. The set with 30° and 60° angles is the most commonly used
                                                 as it places less strain on the cables when they are being drawn in. It is this set
                                                 that we will consider here.

            If we know what height is required for the set, we can identify the distance
            between the two bends: the height of the set multiplied by two bends. For
            example, if the set is required to be 50 mm, the distance between the two bends
            will be 100 mm (50 × 2 = 100).                                                                                  100

            Having worked this out, we can mark out the conduit to be bent. Make the first
            mark where the first bend should go. Then, measure the distance required (from                  p	 Figure 4.74 Marking out for
            the calculation) and make the second mark (Figure 4.74).                                           bends for a set
            Having made the two marks, position the conduit in the conduit bender with the
            first mark aligned with the centre of the bender. This can be checked using an
            engineer’s square placed on the conduit. This may not be directly at the top of
            the bender, as it will depend on whether the conduit sits horizontally within the
            bender.

            Steadily, bend the conduit down to an angle of around 30°, making sure you check
            the angle as you go.

                                                  Once the first bend has been performed, the conduit must be rotated by 180°
                                                  while still in the bender. Line up the second mark with the centre of the former
                                                  and proceed as before.

                                                  It is important, at this point, to check that the conduit is correctly aligned in the
                                                  conduit bender. Using a spirit level, ensure that the first bend is sitting perfectly
                                                  vertical and not leaning to one side or the other. If it is not vertical, the second
                                                  bend will not line up with the first and the two bends will be offset.

                                                  With the conduit correctly aligned, the second bend can be performed until the
                                                  start of the conduit runs parallel with the end of the conduit.

                                                  This type of bend can be performed in one of two ways. The first is by performing
                                                  two separate sets; this method can be used where lots of pipes (or other
                                                  obstacles) are to be crossed in one go.

            This second, more common, method requires three bends to be made within
            close proximity to one another. This takes a bit of practice to get right. Start off
            by placing a 45° bend in the conduit at the point which will be the centre of the
            bubble set. Then remove the conduit from the conduit bender and place it flat
            down on a surface to mark out the other two bends. Using a straight edge and
            tape measure, position the straight edge 30 mm below the inside edge of the
            first bend, making sure it is kept an even distance from the bend for both straight
            sections of conduit on either side of the bend. (This dimension will provide a very
            close bubble set for 20 mm conduit and can be increased if a larger clearance is        ACTIVITY
            required.) Mark on the conduit where the straight edge meets the conduit on both        There is also a bridge set
            sides of the bend.                                                                      where the middle section

                                                                                                    surface. Make a sketch of
            each side of the first bend. Now position the conduit back in the conduit bender        what this would look like.
            with the top of the first bend pointing downwards and at the stop end.




            p	 Figure 4.81 Positioning of straight edge for marking the second and third bends

            Using the same method for lining up the conduit in the conduit bender as the
            method for a set, ensure the second mark is positioned correctly on the conduit
            bender. The second bend of 45° can now be applied.
            The third bend is a repeat of the process for the second bend but on the other
            side of the first bend. With the bends correct, the conduit run before and after
            the bubble set should line up. Fine adjustment can be performed by replacing the
            conduit in the conduit bender and adjusting by hand.

            Bending PVC conduit
            The bending of PVC conduit is very similar to bending steel conduit as you use
            the same bends and measure them out in the same way. The difference is that a
            conduit bender is not used. Instead, a bending spring is used to help the conduit
            maintain its shape.
            The bending spring is used to support the inside of the conduit to stop it from
            becoming squashed during the bending process. Bending springs come in two
            types:
            l	 white tipped – for light gauge PVC conduit
            l	 green tipped – for heavy gauge PVC conduit.

            Bending springs are designed so that they can be fed easily into the conduit prior
            to bending. Before use, it is important to attach a means of removing the spring
            after the bend. Simply tie a piece of string to the loop at one end or, preferably,    p	 Figure 4.82 Bending spring

                                              use a cable. The string or cable should be fed through the centre of the bending
                                              spring. This will stop the spring being stretched and damaged during the removal.
                                              Nowadays, some PVC conduits can be cold bent. However, it is sometimes necessary
                                              to heat the conduit prior to bending and this can be done in several ways. Some
                                              electricians use a heat blanket for PVC conduit; however, simply rubbing the conduit
                                              where it will be bent produces enough heat to help with the bend.
                                              Having measured the bend, insert the spring into the conduit so that it is
                                              positioned where the bend is to be performed. One way to do this is to measure
                                              how much string or cable should be drawn into the conduit to hold the spring in
                                              the correct place.
                                              With the spring in place, heat the conduit by simply rubbing your hand up and
                                              down the position for the bend. Don’t rub too hard or you will get blisters – hands
                                              can be protected by using gloves or a cloth. The internal bend radius should be the
                                              same as for steel conduit, so an internal radius of 2.5 times the conduit diameter
                                              is needed. The easiest way to bend PVC conduit is over the top of the thigh.
                                              Remember to remove items such as money, phone and keys from your pockets
                                              before starting.
                                              The bend should be performed in one go. So, once the conduit is heated, place
                                              your hands 300–400 mm apart on either side of section to be bent, and then
                                              bend the conduit over your thigh. The bend will need to go a little past the
                                              required angle as the conduit will tend to spring back once released.
                                              If the wrong bending spring is used for a particular type of conduit, the bend
                                              can become damaged. Ribbing of the bend happens when the spring creates
                                              indentations on the outside of the bend. It can also result in kinks on the inside of
                                              the bend where the conduit tries to flatten during the bend.
                                              When creating sets, it sometimes helps to mark a line so that the bends will
                                              always be square to one another. The line can be used to make sure that your
                                              hands and bending force are in the correct place before you bend. PVC conduit
                                              usually has writing along one side and this can be used as a guide. However, it is
                                              important to ensure that any lines are removed before installation and any printed
                                              writing is positioned to the back of the conduit, out of sight.

                                              Wiring conduit systems
                                              One of the key points to remember when installing a conduit system is that the
                                              wiring cannot be installed until the conduit is complete.
                                              Bear in mind that BS 7671 states that we need to protect the insulation of the
                                              wiring from damage during installation and maintenance. This is important when
                                              guiding wiring into conduit sections. All the wires for a piece of conduit need to be
                                              installed, or ‘drawn in’, at the same time. Wires are fed into the conduit and pulled
                                              from the other end at the same time.
                                              The wires are drawn in using a push-and-pull technique that requires a draw tape
                                              to be placed in the conduit from the finish end first. A draw tape is a nylon cable

            that has a metal cap attached to a spring at one end. This end is pushed into the
            conduit from the finishing end of the run. It is pushed right into the conduit until
            the end with the metal cap emerges at the beginning of the conduit run. If the
            conduit run is long, this may have to be done in stages (draw tapes tend to come
            in 5 m, 10 m and 20 m lengths).

            Once the draw tape has been pushed through the conduit, and the end is sticking              INDUSTRY TIP
            out of the conduit, the wiring can be attached to the draw tape. The most

            With the wires grouped together, the long wire can now be secured to the draw
            tape by feeding it through the hole in the end of the cap and then bending it back
            on itself to form a tight loop. This loop is then secured in place with more PVC
            tape. It is important to ensure this attachment is as secure as possible. Depending
            on the cross-sectional area of the wire, several passes may be made through the
            hole in the cap on the end of the draw tape.
            Once the wiring is secured to the draw tape, it is ready to be drawn into the                INDUSTRY TIP

                                                                                                   Cables should be fed into
            conduit, guiding the wiring through the conduit, as the other person gently pulls

            The push-and-pull technique is repeated until the wiring reaches its destination
            and the draw tape exits the conduit. Shorter runs, no longer than a metre, with no
            bends, can be installed without the use of a draw tape. The wiring is still grouped
            as it would be when using draw tape, but in this case the long wire is simply
            bent over to form a loop. This presents a curved edge which helps the wires
            move through the conduit and prevents the wire getting stuck on any edges at
            accessories or joints.

            Trunking systems
            As with conduit systems, there are various forms of trunking system. Trunking is
            the generic name given to the enclosure of a wiring system that has a rectangular
            or box section fabrication and a removable lid. The purpose of trunking is to
            enable wiring to be installed easily and to provide the wiring with a level of
            mechanical protection.

                                                Trunking systems come in two forms:
                                                l	   PVC
                                                l	   steel.
                                                The different types of trunking that are available and their uses are identified on
                         INDUSTRY TIP           pages 197–8. Here we will look at terminating steel trunking only. Termination of

                                                sections. This is called segregation. It is a requirement to remove potential
                                                interference from sensitive circuits and circuits of different voltage bands.

                                                Steel trunking comes in a variety of different types of finishes including:
                                                l	 hot-dipped galvanised coating
                                                l	 grey enamel on zinc coating

                                                l	 silver enamel on zinc coating

                                                l	 stainless steel.

                                                Other finishes are also available to order. Trunking is typically stocked and sold in
                                                3 m lengths, with the exception of lighting trunking which is also stocked and sold
                                                in 5 m lengths.
                                                Trunking comes in a variety of different sizes, with some of the more common
                                                ones being listed within Appendix E of the IET On-Site Guide. Most suppliers will
                                                provide less common types and sizes of trunking, but only on special request and
                                                subject to a minimum order quantity.

                                                Sizing of trunking
                                                Even in trunking the cables get hot. There must be sufficient air space around the
                                                cables so they do not become overheated.
                                                The maximum fill capacity for trunking differs from that of conduit as trunking
                                                is designed to carry both wires and cables. There is a constant fill capacity of
                                                45% which means that air must occupy at least 55% of the internal area of the
                                                trunking.
                                                The IET On-Site Guide has standard tables which take into account all the factors
                                                that govern how many conductors can be installed in a piece of trunking. The
                                                tables take into account the size and type of conductors, but do not consider
                                                bends or length as this does not affect the size of trunking to be used. The IET
                                                On-Site Guide also does not include the factors for different cables and the
                                                trunking manufacturer’s data sheets should be consulted in these cases.

            When using Appendix E, follow this simple and logical approach:
            1	   Identify the different sizes of the wiring conductors.
            2	   Identify the quantities of each different size.
            3	   Using the tables in Appendix E, select the correct cable factor.
            4	   Multiply the factor by the number of conductors.
            5	   Add the totals together.
            6	   Select the trunking with the next factor up from the total value.

              EXAMPLE
              One easy way to follow these steps is to use a simple table, filling in the data as
              you go. This example is a trunking sizing calculation for a steel trunking system
              carrying eight single-phase circuits. Four circuits have conductors with a size
              of 25 mm2 and the other four are 16 mm2. The circuits are wired in single-core
              cables and each circuit needs a circuit protective conductor of the same size as
              the live conductors.

              The final result is an overall trunking factor of 1461. Using the appropriate table
              in Appendix E of the IET On-Site Guide, it can be seen that 75 mm × 50 mm or
              100 mm × 38 mm trunking can be used – both have a spacing factor in excess
              of the 1461 required.
              Unlike conduit, there are often several choices of trunking size to use. The final
              choice will have to take into account the installation and aesthetic qualities required.


            Trunking accessories
            Trunking comes in all shapes and sizes, but the most common is the box type.
            The lid of the trunking forms a slight overlap at either edge, giving strength to the
            overall construction.                                                                        p	 Figure 4.84 Steel trunking
            The lid of the trunking can be held in place with different types of fastenings, the
            most common being the turn buckle. Turn buckles are designed so that a simple
            hole can be drilled in the lid and the body of the turn buckle inserted into the
            hole. The body has a head that fits either a large flat screwdriver or, preferably, a
            pozi-screwdriver, and this needs to be on the outside of the lid. On the inside, the
            turn buckle has a hole into which a rod is inserted that is slightly smaller than the
            width of the trunking. This rod grips under the return edge of the trunking when
            the turn buckle is turned, retaining the lid in place.
            Unlike conduit, the main accessories for steel trunking are used to join trunking
            pieces together rather than to mount accessories. Where accessories are to be

                                                 This can be used when trunking is run up a wall and then turns to run along
                                                 the wall.
                                              l	 There are also variations of the flat bend in terms of the position of the lid. The

                                                 internal bend has the lid positioned on the inside of the bend and the external
                                                 bend has the lid on the outside.

            When two pieces of trunking are to be joined, it is necessary to use two couplings.
            A coupling is simply a plate designed to fit inside the trunking and bridge the                  INDUSTRY TIP
            join. To enable the trunking to be secured, the coupling has two threaded bushes
                                                                                                      Where multiple-compartment
            mounted on one side. This removes the need to position a nut inside the trunking
                                                                                                      trunking is used with
            and so a short length bolt can be used. The bushes on the inside are sometimes            segregated circuits, special
            called ‘captive nuts’ or, more correctly, ‘hank bushes’.                                  crossover pieces may be

            steel. Trunking manufacturers generally recommend, that to ensure continuity, an
            earth strap is installed on the outside of the trunking across the gap.
            At the end of any run of trunking, an open end is normally present and this
            needs to be closed off. To do this an end cap is often used, but in some cases it
            is possible to cut and bend over the lid of the trunking. The end cap has similar
            bushes to those used in the coupling – a short screw can be screwed into the end
            cap, through the trunking, once it is in place.
            Just as with conduit bends, trunking bends can be fabricated or purchased.
            Sometimes fabrication is best when a custom angle or a slightly different bend
            is required. As mentioned earlier, most buildings are not exactly square, meaning        p	 Figure 4.91 End cap
            that pre-manufactured bends do not always fit properly. It is essential, therefore,
            to know how to manufacture these bends.

            Cutting trunking
            Trunking is a hollow structure that must be complete to exhibit its full strength.
            This can be problematic when cutting.
            It is important to cut the trunking and the lid separately as, often, the lid needs to
            be a different size or shape.
            Just as when cutting steel conduit, there are certain tools that are required for
            cutting steel trunking. These include:
            l	   hacksaw with a blade between 24 and 32 TPI
            l	   graphite pencil for marking out                                                      ACTIVITY

            l	   hand file (generally second cut grade)                                               cutting. The mark breaks

            When cutting trunking, make sure that all cuts are even and square; accurate
            marking out is essential. To perform a simple cut, first use the tape measure to
            measure the required length and mark with the pencil. Then, using an engineer’s

                                                 Once marked out, the trunking must be secured ready for cutting. This can be
                                                 achieved by placing the trunking in an engineer’s vice or by using clamps to secure
                                                 the trunking onto a work bench. The position of the clamp should be close to the
                                                 cut line, but not so close as to impede cutting. Trunking should never be held in

                                                 and even. If they are not, they need to be filed. When using the hand file, work

                                                 4.94 shows how the trunking should be marked out for cutting. Note the size of
                                                 the parts to be removed are based on the width of the trunking. The hole in part

                                                 depth of the back and front of part B that needs to be removed is the width of

            Mounting trunking
                                                                                                            INDUSTRY TIP
            There are various methods that can be used for mounting trunking. Most trunking
            is either:                                                                               When fixing trunking, round-
            l	   surface mounted                                                                     head screws should be used,
                                                                                                     as countersunk screws leave
            or                                                                                       a raised edge which could cut
            l	   suspended.                                                                          into cables.

            Surface mounting simply requires mounting holes to be drilled through the
            trunking so that it can be screwed to the surface. For suspended mounting, other
            methods and accessories can be used.
            One method is a simple run of conduit which is secured in place to the ceiling and
            then joined to the trunking using a coupler and male bush arrangement. Another
            common method uses channelling, normally called uni-strut, and threaded shafts,
            called studding.
            The uni-strut is secured in place and captive nuts are positioned within the uni-
            strut. The studding is threaded into the uni-strut and is cut to the required length.
            The trunking is then attached to the studding by use of a trunking suspension
            bracket. The benefit of this system is that the trunking is installed level and true,
            despite deviations in the height of the uni-strut mounts.                               p	 Figure 4.102 Conduit secured to
                                                                                                       ceiling using ceiling flange
            PVC trunking
            The benefit of PVC trunking is that manufacturers can mould many different
            forms, finishes and colours. For example, skirting board trunking can either replace
            the skirting board of the room completely or can supplement the existing skirting
            board. The versatility of PVC trunking means that it is commonly favoured over
            steel trunking, especially in situations where it is visible.

            Cutting PVC trunking
            PVC trunking can be cut using a variety of different methods, including:
            l	 trunking snips
            l	 electrician’s knife
            l	 hacksaw.

            Cutting PVC trunking with trunking snips can be quick, but in colder environments
            this can cause splitting and cracking. Cutting with snips can also cause the
            trunking to deform, but this can be overcome by cutting the lid and the trunking
            at the same time.
            An electrician’s knife can be used to cut through light gauge trunking, but this can
            also result in deformation of the trunking (and injury to fingers). However, when
            removing a part of the trunking wall, scoring the inside edge with an electrician’s
            knife can make the wall weak enough to snap off, leaving a very clean break with
            few sharp edges to be removed.
            Using a hacksaw minimises the risk of deforming the trunking (and of injuring
            the installer). A trunking mitre block is generally used and this can be secured in
            an engineer’s vice. The mitre block typically has two 45° slots and one at 90°,

                                                                                                                                   291

                                              the mitre block has ridges at set intervals and of set sizes, so that the lips of the
                                              trunking and lid slot in. This prevents them moving while being cut.
                                              Trunking is normally cut at 45° for corners and at 90° for joins. Lids tend to be cut
                                              at 90° as the joints and corners are typically covered with an accessory, forming a
                                              moulded section to ensure the relevant IP code rating can be maintained.
                                              It is important to make sure that the trunking has a continuous form around all

                                              The choice of cable tray depends on the application, but heavy gauge is used for
                                              larger cables or where there is a greater mass of smaller cables to be supported.

                                              The difference between solid and perforated cable tray is simply that the perforated

            Cable tray accessories
            As with all other forms of support system, it takes time to fabricate parts during
            cable tray assembly. Some standard items are pre-manufactured. Some of these
            accessories are shown here. It is important to note that the end of each run of
            cable tray is shaped to fit into the next one, providing a standard overlap and
                                                                                                   p	 Figure 4.105 Flat bend
            creating a much stronger join.
            The 90° bend comes in several forms, the first being the flat bend. This is where
            the cable tray can be connected to another piece that is in the same plane, but at
            an angle of 90°.
            As with trunking, sometimes the flat 90° bend is too sharp for larger cables
                                                                                                   p	 Figure 4.106 Relieved flat bend
            and, therefore, a relief bend is required to give a slower bend, permitting a larger
            bending radius.
            Often cable tray has to curve upwards or downwards by 90°, for example when
            the tray has been run along a wall and across a ceiling. In this instance, the bend
            radius still needs to be observed; either an internal or external bend can be used.
            Cable tray also uses the tee piece in both the flat and relieved form, shaped in a
            similar way to trunking.

            Cutting cable tray
            Cable tray is available in 3 m lengths and must be cut to length as required. The
            process for measuring the length required is the same as that for trunking. To cut
            the tray, it must be supported on a flat surface – use clamps to hold it in place or   p	 Figure 4.107 Internal and
            screw the tray to a wooden surface.                                                       external bends
            As with some of the earlier containment systems covered in this unit, the
            accessories for cable tray can also be manufactured if required. When making
            these joints, all sharp edges and burrs must be removed before cables are
            installed. The technique used for removing the walls of the cable tray is the same
            as that used for trunking: a hand file is used to weaken the edge, allowing the
            walls to be bent off by hand.
            The tools needed to cut and form cable tray include:

            When marking out, most of the dimensions are made from the back of the tray
            as this provides a flat surface to work on. However, cutting the tray often involves
            just the walls, so the use of the engineer’s square is essential to transfer the
            measurements to the side walls.

                                               For joining cable tray, one end of each run of tray is reduced in size so that it
                                               can sit inside the other end. This creates an overlap which is typically the same
                                               as the width of the tray being used. Therefore, when any join or bend is being
                                               manufactured, this is the minimum amount of overlap that is required. Using a

                                               the back of the bend so that the wall can be bent down and removed by hand.

                                               Mounting of cable tray
                                               During the erection of cable tray, it is important to ensure it is run level.

            how it is manufactured it is not possible to bend this on site, unlike the other
            containment systems.

            Bends in ladder racking must be designed and ordered accordingly, before the
            ladder racking is installed. Due to the strength of this type of containment it is
            used predominantly for large power cables.
            Ladder racking is similar to cable basket, in that it does not offer much mechanical
            protection to the cables and so the use of armoured cables is common in such
            situations.

            Busbar and Powertrack systems
            In some installations there is a need to provide a level of flexibility regarding where
            the loads are to be connected to the supply. An example of this is in an open office
            area with a raised floor and or a suspended ceiling. For an open-plan office area, the
            system installed needs to be flexible enough to support any arrangement of office
            layout.
            One method of achieving this is with the use of a system called Powertrack,
            which is made up of modular sections. Each section is a rectangular shape, rather
            similar to trunking, but inside the casing three conductors are arranged, each
            connected to connection sockets at regular intervals along their length. These
            connection points can be connected via a form of plug and socket arrangement
            to what are called floor points, in the raised floor. The raised floor is made up of a
            series of tiles mounted on pillars, which are secured to the floor. This arrangement
            results in sections of floor that can be moved from one position to another very

                                                 easily. The system not only saves time in wiring, but also gives great flexibility in
                                                 the layout of modern offices.
                                                 Powertrack also comes in an arrangement that can be installed above suspended
                                                 ceilings and is used for connecting office lighting. This makes installation and
                                                 maintenance of the lighting much safer and more efficient, as a luminaire can be
                                                 disconnected and then brought down to ground level to be worked on.
                                                 Powertrack typically only comes in ratings up to and including 40 A and is single-
                                                 phase only. Larger applications such as three-phase machinery need a different
                                                 solution. Rather than running lots of cables the length of a factory, an alternative
                                                 is the use of busbar trunking. This form of trunking does not house cables. Large
                                                 copper bars are mounted within the trunking and these are used to carry the

            Thermoplastic (PVC) cables
            Thermoplastic cables are commonly referred to as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) cables
            and they come in various shapes, sizes and forms, including:
            l	 single-core cable
            l	 twin and cpc flat-profile cable

            l	 three-core and cpc flat-profile cable

            l	 multi-core flexible cable.

            In domestic installations, the most common cables are the twin and cpc, and the
            three-core and cpc flat-profile cables.
            Cables have three main parts:
            l	 Sheath – this is on the outside and holds the conductors in one cable, as well
               as providing minor mechanical protection to the inner conductors
            l	 Insulation – this is on the live conductors only and is used to provide basic
                                                                                                        INDUSTRY TIP
               protection against electric shock, as well as being a means to identify the

            Conductors can be formed in several ways. Conductors with a cross-sectional
            area (csa) up to and including 2.5 mm2 can be formed out of a single piece of
            copper. Above 2.5 mm2 csa, conductors tend to be made out of multiple strands
            of copper. It is important to be able to bend the cable and a solid piece of copper
            would be hard to bend. However, for conductors of 300 mm2 csa and over, the
            conductors tend to be solid again; bending is not normally required.
            If a cable is to be bent a lot in use, for example in the flex connecting a vacuum
            cleaner to a plug, the conductor is normally made of many fine strands of copper,
            each no thicker than a hair. The reason for this is that as the conductors keep
            getting bent, they will eventually break. In a solid conductor, the circuit would
            be broken. In a conductor consisting of many strands, if one breaks, it will not
            significantly change the amount of current the cable can carry.

            Stripping single-core thermoplastic cables
            Removal of the thermoplastic sheath, or insulation, is relatively easy with
            thermoplastic cables.
            Use of wire strippers is recommended for single-core conductors. Automatic
            wire strippers tend to rip the insulation from the conductor and can damage the

                                              insulation. Manual wire strippers are preferred and these come in various forms,
                                              but all work on a similar principle.
                                              Manual wire strippers all have two blades that cross one another like scissors. The
                                              blades each have a notch so that they cut around the conductor in the middle.
                                              They also all have a means of adjustment so that different sizes of conductor can
                                              be stripped (Figure 4.112).
                                              Before using wire strippers, they must be set to the correct size. This can be done
                                              using a scrap or off-cut piece of wire of the correct size. With the jaws of the
                                              wire strippers together, turn the adjustment screw until the hole in the jaws is
            p	 Figure 4.112 Cable stripper    just bigger than the size of the conductor to be stripped. Test the setting on the
               jaws
                                              off-cut piece of wire by placing the wire strippers over the wire and squeezing
                                              the handles to close the jaws. Then slightly release the jaws and try to slide the
                                              insulation off using the wire strippers to assist.
                                              If the wire strippers are correctly set, the insulation will come off easily and there
                                              will be no damage to the copper conductor. If the aperture is set too small, the
                                              insulation will slide off easily but the conductor may be damaged. If set too large,
                                              the insulation will not come off easily. A simple adjustment of the adjusting
                                              screw will correct these problems. Now, with the correct setting, the wires can be
                                              stripped safely.

                                              Stripping flat-profile thermoplastic cable
                                              Flat-profile cable is stripped in the same way as single-core cables, once the
                                              sheath has been removed. There are several ways to do this, but some methods
                                              can damage the cables.
                                              First identify how much cable is required within the accessory. A conductor should
                                              terminate with ease at any termination point within the accessory. As a rule of
                                              thumb, measure the diagonal size of the accessory and then add 10% to allow
                                              for termination. However, if the accessory is a distribution panel, wires must be
                                              able to reach not just the required position, but also any point on the panel if the
                                              sequence of the board were to be changed.
                                              Next, identify how much of the sheath should be removed from the cable. The
                                              purpose of the sheath is to provide some mechanical protection for the insulation
                                              on the conductors. However, too much sheath within the accessory takes up
                                              space and will put excess strain on the conductors. The sheath should be stripped
                                              back almost to where the cable enters the accessory, leaving only
                                              10–15 mm, a thumb’s width, of sheath within the accessory.
                                              Having decided on the length of sheath required and with the cable in place, score
                                              round the sheath so that it can be removed. This can be done with a scriber or,
                                              preferably, with an electrician’s knife. Care should be taken not to cut into the
                                              wires. Use a pair of side cutters to snip down the centre of the cable, splitting the
                                              line to one side and the neutral to the other.
                                              Pull the live conductor and sheath apart, tearing the sheath as far as the score mark.
                                              Once at the score mark, bend the sheath back and snap it off, leaving a clean finish.
                                              Now the inner wires can be stripped in the same manner as single-core wires,
                                              making sure that green and yellow sleeving is applied to the bare copper cpc.

            An alternative – but less safe – method of removing the sheath is to score round
            the sheath with an electrician’s knife, then to split the sheath by running a knife
            along the route of the protective conductor. The risk with this method is of
            damaging the cpc or even the insulation of the conductors.

            Stripping thermoplastic flexible cables
            Stripping the actual wires of flexible cables is done in the same way as stripping
            single-core wires. However, the sheath is stripped in a different way from the
            other cables already mentioned here.
            The outer sheath can be removed with the use of a ringing tool which comes in
            various shapes and forms, the most basic of which is shown in Figure 4.113. This
            tool slides over the end of the cable, to the required position, and is then rotated
            around the cable, cutting it slightly. The ringing tool is removed, the cable is bent
            to finish the cut and the sheath is then pulled off.
            There may be times when a ringing tool is not available, so it is important to know
            how to do this without a special tool. Thermoplastic has a tendency to split when        p	 Figure 4.113 Flexible cable
            it is damaged and stretched, and this feature can be used to help strip the sheath.         sheath-stripping tool
            Bend the cable tightly at the point where the sheath is to be removed. Using a
            sharp knife gently score the top of the bend, noticing the thermoplastic split open
            like a little mouth. Gently work the split until the inner cables are visible and then
            unbend, rotate and re-bend the cable at about 90° from the first point. Repeat the
            score until again the wires become visible. Taking care not to cut into the wires,
            repeat the bend and cut until the sheath can be removed. Once the sheath has
            been removed, the wires can be stripped as mentioned previously.

                                                When crimping lugs onto cables, it is important that the correct size lugs and

            The maximum operating temperature of conductors with thermoplastic
            insulation (usually PVC) is 70 °C, whilst the maximum operating temperature of
            thermosetting cables (XLPE) is 90 °C. When using thermosetting cables at 90 °C,
            it is important to make sure that the terminals are capable of withstanding this
            temperature, as the majority of electrical accessories are designed to operate
            at 70 °C. Other specialist cables may operate at higher temperatures, so it is
            important to check the maximum operating temperature of the terminals.

              From this regulation it is
              clear that the practice of

              boxes and placing these in

                                                  This requires that the insulation of the cable must not be adversely affected by
                                                  the temperature attained at a connection. An example of this may be where
                                                  a cable with an insulation temperature rating of 70 °C is connected to a bus-
                                                  bar which has been designed to run at a higher temperature. In this case the
                                                  insulation on the cable would be removed from the cable to a suitable distance
                                                  and replaced with insulation capable of withstanding the higher temperature.

            This requires that there is ‘no appreciable mechanical strain in the connections of
            conductors.’ Mechanical strain may come about due to:
            l	 the conductor bending too tightly before entering the terminal, causing
               the termination to be under constant stress. Cables must be installed in
               accordance with the minimum bend radii, as given in the IET On-Site Guide or
               IET Guidance Note 1 (GN1).
            l	 cables having no form of strain relief fitted. This can exert mechanical forces

               on the termination, due to the weight of the cable pulling on the termination.
               Cables should be fixed at the maximum distances given in the IET On-Site
               Guide or IET GN1. The fitting of suitable cable glands, where cables enter
               enclosures, provides strain relief on the terminations.
            l	 cables terminated without any slack. Under faulty conditions large

               electromagnetic forces, due to high fault currents, are exerted on the cables,
               with the highest forces being exerted at the ‘crutch point’, where cables come
               together at the outer sheath. If there is little slack in the cables, the forces will
               be transferred to the terminal.

                                              This requires that, where a joint in a conductor is made within an enclosure, the
                                              enclosure must provide adequate mechanical protection as well as protection
                                              against relevant external influences. The minimum requirements for an enclosure
                                              to meet the requirements for basic protection are that:
                                              l	 the bottom sides and face meet at least IP2X or IPXXB
                                              l	 for the top surface, the enclosure must meet IP4X or IPXXD.

                                              However it may also be necessary to take into account external influences such as
                                              water ingress or dust ingress, depending on the location.

                                              The IP Code
                                              The IP Code is an international code specifically aimed at manufacturers of
                                              enclosures and equipment. It applies to degrees of protection provided by
                                              electrical equipment enclosures with rated voltages not exceeding 72.5 kV. The
                                              abbreviation ‘IP’ stands for International Protection, so the full title is International
                                              Protection Code (IP). The code is defined in IEC 60529 (BS EN 60529).
                                              The three general categories of protection given in the standard are:
                                              1	 the ingress of solid foreign objects (first digit)
                                              2	 the ingress of water (second digit)
                                              3	 the access of persons to harmful electrical or mechanical parts.
                                              When referring to the IP code in wiring regulations, ‘X’ is used in place of the first
                                              or second numeral, to indicate that:
                                              1	 the test is not applicable to that enclosure or
                                              2	 in the case of standards, the classification of protection is not applicable to this
                                                 standard.

            must meet at least IP2 but the requirement for water ingress protection is not

            Screw terminals
            When cables are terminated into electrical equipment, the type of terminal used
            must be taken into account. Most accessories use a grub screw, which is screwed
            down onto the conductor to ensure it is retained in place. Problems arise, however,
            when the terminal is designed to take more than one conductor, or a conductor of
            a larger csa than the one being installed.
            The common types of screw terminal used in the accessories within electrical
            installations are:
            l	   square
            l	 circular
            l	 moving-plate

            l	 insulation-displacement

            l	 pillar.


            Square base terminal
            The use of square terminals can be seen in accessories such as socket outlet face-
            plates, where two or even three cables can be terminated in the same terminal.
            These terminals are designed to accept up to three cables and, where a single
            conductor is used, the screw can miss or damage the conductor. To minimise
            the potential for problems, the end of the conductor is bent over to increase the
            contact area available for the screw of the terminal.




            p	 Figure 4.127 Square terminal showing possible problems if conductor is not doubled over

            To bend over the end of the conductor, it is necessary to remove twice the normal
            amount of insulation from the cable. Then a pair of long-nosed pliers is used to fold
            the exposed conductor in half. It is important to make sure that both sides of the
            bend are the same length, as shown in the centre diagram of Figure 4.128. If the             p	 Figure 4.128 Bending over the
            return edge is too long, as shown in the left diagram of Figure 4.128, the conductor            end of a conductor: bend is too
            may protrude from the terminal, causing a shock hazard. If it is too short, as shown            big, correct and too small
            on the right diagram of Figure 4.128, the bend will be redundant.

            Circular terminal
            Circular terminals can be seen in accessories such as light switches and ceiling
            roses, where single cables or small cables are terminated. They are also commonly
            found in consumer units and distribution boards on both the neutral and earth
            bars.
            Circular bottom terminals are designed to ensure that the conductor is positioned
            directly beneath the terminal screw, so there is no need to bend the end of the              p	 Figure 4.129 Circular base
            conductor over.                                                                                 terminal

                                              Moving-plate terminal
                                              Moving plate terminals are often used on protective devices, such as circuit
                                              breakers and fuse holders that are mounted in consumer units and distribution
                                              boards.
                                              The option of bending over the end of the conductor depends not only on the
                                              size of the conductor, but also on the size and type of the terminal. If the terminal
                                              is the type where the bottom moves up towards the top when the screw is
                                              tightened, it is not necessary to bend over the conductor, as the terminal tightens

                                              evenly. If, however, the terminal has a plate that moves towards the bottom of
               moving-plate terminal
                                              the terminal as the screw is tightened, small conductors should be doubled over. If
                                              there is any doubt, refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
                                              No matter what type of terminal is being used, different conductor types should
                                              never be mixed within the same terminal. If flexible cable is terminated within
                                              the same terminal as solid or stranded cable, the screw may fail to clamp on the
                                              flexible cable and only a few of the fine strands may be secured. This could result
                                              in a poor electrical connection and the wire might come loose.
                                              If there is no option other than to mix flexible cable and solid or stranded
                                              conductors in the same terminal, the flexible conductor must be fitted with
                                              a ferrule. This is a small, metal tube that is crimped onto the end of a flexible
                                              conductor to hold the strands together.
                                              Terminating copper and aluminium conductors within the same terminal should
                         INDUSTRY TIP         also be avoided due to the electrolytic reaction between the two different metals.
                                              Whatever types of terminal and conductor are being used, always make sure that
              Common faults with
                                              the screw tightens on the conductor and not the insulation. To ensure this, the
              terminations are exposed
              conductors or screwing down     insulation should stop at the opening of the terminal. Take care not to stop the

                                              The advantages of screw terminals are:

            Crimps
            Crimps and crimp lugs come in two basic forms, insulated and uninsulated.

            Insulated crimps
            When using a cable crimp lug, the wire’s insulation must be stripped back about 5
            mm. This enables the crimp to be installed with the correct amount of conductor
            within the crimp and with the insulating section being sealed down onto the
            insulation of the wire.
            Crimp lugs come in three colours for the different sizes of wires:
            l	 red – 1 mm2 to 1.5 mm2 wires
                            2           2
            l	 blue – 1.5 mm to 2.5 mm wires

            l	 yellow – 4 mm to 6 mm wires.

            Uninsulated crimps
            Uninsulated crimps are used on conductors with cross-sectional areas from 6 mm2
            upwards. It is important that the crimp is sized in accordance with the cross-
            sectional area of the conductors and is compatible with the conductor material
            being terminated.
            Whilst a hand crimper may be suitable for smaller-sized conductors, on larger
            conductors a hydraulic crimper will be required. Battery-operated crimp tools are
            available that take all of the hard work out of crimping a lug onto a conductor.

            Method
            Select the correct size cable lug for the conductor. Cable lugs with different-sized
            holes are available, so be sure to always choose one that has the correct-sized        p	 Figure 4.132 Uninsulated

                                                  The consequences of terminations not
                                                  being electrically and mechanically sound
                                                  If the termination of cables and conductors is not electrically or mechanically
                                                  sound, the consequences can be disastrous. The cause of terminations not being
                                                  electrically and mechanically sound is usually high-resistance joints or corrosion.

                                                  The effects of high-resistance joints
                                                  The most common cause of high-resistance joints is a loose connection. When
                                                  current is passed across such a joint, it heats up. This is likely to cause damage to
                                                  the cable insulation and/or the connected electrical equipment. In the worst case,
                                                  this may result in the overheating of adjacent material, resulting in a possible fire.
                                                  It is important to make sure that cables are seated properly in the terminals and
                                                  that the terminals are correctly tightened. Manufacturer’s instructions need to be
                                                  consulted to check whether a torque setting is given for connections, which must
                                                  then be complied with.
                                                  It should be remembered that, even with a sound connection, when current is
                                                  flowing, the conductors and terminations will heat up, resulting in expansion of
                                                  the metal, which can lead to loosening of the terminal. This is why terminals,
            p	 Figure 4.141 Lug bolted to         apart from those exempted by regulation 526.3, must be accessible for
               casing of equipment                maintenance and inspection.
                                                  Another cause of loose terminations is vibration from such things as machinery.
                         INDUSTRY TIP             It is important that initial terminations are correctly made and tightened and that
                                                  regular maintenance is carried out to ensure that loose connections cannot occur.
              When high-resistance joints

                                              designation ‘CXT’. In this case the third letter, T, signifies that the braid is formed
                                              into a tail (T) and the gland is designed to terminate by this means.
                                              The construction and fitting of each type of gland will be discussed separately,

            Shrouds




            p	 Figure 4.144 A range of shrouds

            What does a cable shroud do? A cable shroud can aid the process of keeping the
            surface of the gland clean and free from the build-up of dirt. It does not, however,
            necessarily improve the ingress protection (IP) rating of the cable gland. In fact,
            the gland will invariably have been tested and rated without the installation of a
            cable shroud. The shroud may provide corrosion protection to cable armour or the
            sheath, but it must be installed in such a way as not to trap moisture under itelf
            and thus increase the corrosion potential. If the shroud is too loose on the cable
            sheath, moisture may enter the assembly and, as the fit with the gland is going to
            be tight, the moisture will be trapped.
            Shrouds generally come in PVC or LSF (low smoke and fume) varieties, in a range
            of sizes to match the gland, and in a range of colours to match the sheath colour                                    p	 Figure 4.145 A badly fitted

            How to fit a shroud to ensure a tight fit to the cable sheath
            The same method of fitting a shroud can be used with all cables.

                                              Method
                                              Before the flex can be terminated, the outer sheath must be removed.
                                              Two methods of removing the outer sheath are outlined here.
                                              Method 1 – The outer sheath can be removed with the use of a ringing tool. These
                                              come in various shapes and forms, the most basic of which is shown in the diagram.
                                              This tool slides over the end of the cable to the required stripping position, and is
                                              then rotated around the cable, cutting it slightly.

                                              The ringing tool is removed, the cable is bent to finish the cut and the sheath is
                                              then pulled off.




                                              p	 Figure 4.152 Outer sheath being removed

                                              Method 2 – There may be times when a ringing tool is not available, so it
                                              is important to know how to remove the outer sheath without this tool.
                                              Thermoplastic has a tendency to split when it is damaged and pressure is applied,
                                              and this can be used to help strip the sheath.
                                              Bend the cable into a tight bend at the point where the sheath is to be removed.
                                              Using a sharp knife, gently score the top of the bend. The thermoplastic will split
                                              open like a little mouth (Figure 4.153).

            Gently work the split until the inner cables are visible and then unbend, rotate
            and rebend the cable at about 90° from the first point. Repeat the scoring of the
            sheath until again the wires become visible. Repeat the bend and cut until the
            sheath can be removed, being careful, at all times, not to cut into the wires.

            Once the sheath has been removed, the wires can be stripped and connected, as
            detailed in the next section, but remember that the conductors are fine strands
            and therefore need to be fully contained with a suitable terminal or they need to      p	 Figure 4.153 Bending cable to

            Fire-resistant cables are stripped in a similar way to flexes. However, take care
            with the insulation on the inner cores as this is usually silicon rubber rather than
            PVC, and is easily damaged. Entry to enclosures is usually by means of a plastic

                                              Safety considerations
                                              There is a risk of injury from slipping with cutters or pliers. The use of gloves and
                                              eye protection is recommended.

                                              Method
                                              As single-core cables do not have outer sheaths to remove because they are
                                              intended to be installed within trunking or conduit, the termination method is
                                              straightforward and requires the minimum of tools. This termination method will
                                              therefore also apply to the final connection of other cable types.
                                              Use of wire-strippers is recommended for single-core conductors. Automatic wire-
                                              strippers tend to rip the insulation from the conductor and can damage it. Manual
                                              wire-strippers are preferred and these come in various forms, but all work on a
                                              similar principle.
                                              Manual wire-strippers have two blades that cross one, another like scissors. Each
            p	 Figure 4.156 Cable stripper    blade has a notch so that together they cut around the conductor in the middle.
               jaws                           In addition, wire-strippers also have some means of adjustment so that different
                                              sizes of conductor can be stripped.
                                              Before wire-strippers can be used, they must be set to the correct size. This can
                                              be done using a scrap or off-cut of wire of the correct size. With the jaws of the
                                              wire-strippers together, turn the adjustment screw until the hole in the jaws is just
                                              bigger than the conductor to be stripped. Test the setting on the off-cut of wire,
                                              by placing the wire-strippers over the wire and squeezing the handles to close the
                                              jaws. Then slightly release the jaws and try to slide the insulation off, using the
                                              wire-strippers.
                                              If the wire-strippers are correctly set, the insulation will come off easily and there
                                              will be no damage to the copper conductor. If the aperture is set too small, the
                                              insulation will slide off easily but the conductor may be damaged. If it is set too
                                              large, the insulation will not come off easily. A simple adjustment of the adjusting
                                              screw will correct these problems. Now, with the correct setting, the wires can be
                                              stripped safely.
                                              Other types of wire-stripper will have pre-set stripping holes so that selecting the
                                              correct hole will ensure that the depth of cut is correct every time.
                                              Once the conductors are stripped they are ready to be connected to the electrical
                                              equipment.

            Method
            Before the conductors can be connected, the outer sheath of the cable must be
            removed.
            First, identify how much of the sheath should be removed from the cable.
            The purpose of the sheath is to provide some mechanical protection for the
            insulation on the conductors. Too much sheath, however, takes up space within
            the accessory and will put excess strain on the conductors. The sheath should,
            therefore, be stripped back almost to where the cable enters the accessory,
            leaving only 10–15 mm, a thumb’s width, of sheath within the accessory.
            There is more than one way to remove the outer sheath. Each has its advantages
            and disadvantages but, whichever method is used, care must be taken to              p	 Figure 4.159 Determining the

            conductors.                                                                            sheath
            Method 1 – Having decided on the length of sheath required, and with the cable
            in place, score the sheath at the point to which it is to be removed. This can be
            performed with an electrician’s knife. Care should be taken not to cut into the
            cable.

            mark, leaving a clean finish.
            Method 2 – Snip down the end of the cable with the side-cutters, then use a
            sharp electrician’s knife to slice down the cable. To do this, run the blade along
            the protective conductor. Note that this can damage the protective conductor or,
            even worse, the insulation of one of the live conductors if it is not done carefully.

            Method 3 – Snip down the end of the cable and gently pull the cpc with pliers,
            almost like a cheese wire, to tear the outer sheath as far as the point to which it is
            to be stripped. Take care not to apply too much force or to damage the cpc, nor to
            strip too far.

              You may come across some
              old MICC (pyrotenax) cable         Pots, seals and glands are sized to fit a particular size of cable. A cable designated
              which has gland sizes              2L1.5 has two cores, light-duty insulation (500V maximum) and a cross-
              identified by letters. Although    sectional area of 1.5 mm2. Termination components are chosen to match these
              this cable may be 50 years         specifications.
              old, the durability of the cable
              means it is still operational.     Step 1 Prepare the cable
                                                 To ensure easy stripping, the end of the cable must not be crushed in any way.
                                                 The ideal way of cutting the cable is with a junior hacksaw; however a sharp pair
                                                 of cable croppers can be used, with care.

                                                 Step 2 Fitting the shroud
                                                 Whilst the shroud can be fitted any time before step 5, it is best to cut the shroud
                                                 top to the correct size before the outer sheath is removed. See the method of
                                                 fitting the shroud, as described on page 319.

                                                 Step 3 Remove the outer sheath if applicable
                                                 Where the cable has an outer PVC sheath, it will need to be removed far enough

               the cable                         strip can be determined by taking into account:
                                                 l	 the length of the termination tail
                                                 l	 the pot length

                                                 l	 an allowance to allow the crimper end to fit between the pot and the gland.

                                                    This will vary with different crimp tools.

            Step 4 Strip the copper sheath
            The next step is to strip the copper sheath. Whilst there is more than one method
            of doing this, including using side-cutters, the easiest method is to use a specialist
            tool designed purely for this purpose.




            p	 Figure 4.172 Different types of rotary strippers

            Each of the tools works on the same principle. A small blade cuts into the metal
            sheath and peels off a small amount of copper sheath with each rotation.




            p	 Figure 4.173 JOI stripper in use

            When the correct length of cable is reached, a pair of pliers is used to grip the
            cable just ahead of the stripper. This stops the stripper moving further down the
            cable.

                                              With the pliers in this position the stripper is turned again. As the stripper cannot
                                              move down the cable, it cuts a clean square edge to the cable. The sheath is
                                              pulled off and the cable is tapped gently to remove any powdered insulation that
                                              may be attached to the conductors.

                                              Step 5 Fit the gland to the cable
                                              Push the gland onto the cable but do not tighten it.

                                              specifically designed for this job.
                                              Using the type of pot wrench shown in Figure 4.176 requires that the wrench is

            This type of pot wrench does not require a gland to be fitted to the pot. The
            wheel on the pot wrench locks against the knurled edge of the pot, thus locking
            the pot to the wrench.
            With either type, pressure needs to be applied to get the pot started. As the pot is
            turned, it cuts a thread on the cable sheath.

                                              avoiding any air pockets.
                                              The sealing pot must now be sealed with another plastic sealing disc. Place the

                                               Step 7 Test the cable
              ACTIVITY
                                               To ensure that there are no faults on the cable or cable termination, carry out an
              After one pot termination
              is completed, the cable          insulation resistance test between all conductor combinations and between each
              should be tested. Why is         conductor and the sheath of the cable.
              this?




                         INDUSTRY TIP
              Carry this test out before
              crimping the pot up, but make
              sure that the other end of the
              cable is not shorted out.

                                               Step 8 Identify the cores
                                               The cores of an MICC cable will now need to be identified at both ends. This
                                               entails connecting one of the cores to the copper sheath at one end of the cable.
                                               Then, using a low-resistance ohmmeter or a continuity buzzer, at the other end of
                                               the cable test between the copper sheath of the cable and each of the cores until
                                               you identify which is connected to sheath. The cores are then marked up with
                                               tape or, if available in the termination kit, the appropriate coloured stub sleeving.
                                               It is important that the previous test has already been completed to ensure that
                                               none of the cores is shorted to earth within the pots. This process will be repeated
                                               with each of the cores until all cores are identified.

            Step 9 Fit the gland to the electrical equipment or accessory box
            The gland is now fitted to the accessory or electrical equipment by means of a
            locknut or lock ring.
            Using this method may mean that the pot protrudes into the accessory box,
            making the fitting of the accessory difficult. An alternative method is to fit a
            coupler to the accessory box by means of a male bush, then connect the gland to
            this, ensuring that the pot does not protrude into the accessory box.
            Once the gland body is fitted tightly to the accessory, the back nut can be
            tightened, which causes the internal olive to compress and ‘bite’ into the copper
            sheath, forming a waterproof seal. After this stage, it is not possible to reposition
            the gland.

            Step 10 Terminate the cores to the electrical equipment
            The cable is now ready for final termination.

                                              Method
                                              Steel wire armoured cables are used wherever there is a need for a cable with
                                              added mechanical protection. They are found in many industrial installations and
                                              are used where cables need to be buried in the ground. Single-core armoured
                                              cable has aluminium armour rather than steel wire armour, to reduce induced
                                              circulating currents within the armour, an effect known as eddy currents. Larger
                         INDUSTRY TIP         cables may have aluminium conductors rather than copper conductors, to reduce
                                              costs.
              When working with XLPE, you
              may find that it is generally   Armoured cables are available with thermoplastic (PVC) and thermosetting (XLPE,
              stiffer than PVC.               cross-linked polyethylene) insulation. Whichever type of cable and whichever
                                              insulation type, the termination method is the same.
                                              Whilst the armour of the cable is there for mechanical protection of the
                                              conductors, it may also be used as a cpc for the circuit. If the armour is not used
                                              as a cpc, it must still be connected to the main earth terminal (MET) of the
                                              installation, as the armour forms part of the electrical installation.
                                              Armoured cables can be terminated with two different types of gland, BW for
                                              indoor use and CW for outdoor use. Each method is described below.
                                              BW glands – these glands are for indoor use as they have no seal. The BW glands
                                              are available in two- and three-part configurations.

            The three-part gland has a cone ring as the extra component. The cone ring is
            tapered so that, as the gland is tightened, the cone ring is forced down onto the
            cone, tightening against the armour.
            CW glands – these glands can be used outside. A CW gland has a seal, which
            seals the gland to the cable sheath. CW glands are available in three- and four-
            part configurations; again, the difference is the cone ring.

            Whilst the gland may be terminated onto the cable before any connection to the
            equipment is made, there are occasions when armoured cable has to be installed
            between fixed points without any tolerance or slack. Larger cables are more
            difficult to handle, so careful marking out of the cable is important. The following
            method assumes that the cable is to be fitted to electrical equipment that has
            already been fixed to a wall.
            These are the steps in the process of terminating an armoured cable.

                                                 One side of the Piranha nut has small, sharp edges, like teeth, which bite into the
                                                 enclosure as the nut is tightened, giving a good electrical connection. The nut
                                                 also has threaded holes on each of the nut faces, to allow machine screws to be
                                                 secured to the nut, thereby providing points for connecting the earthing fly-lead
                                                 directly to the nut. This method is especially useful when terminating armoured
                                                 cables into plastic boxes.

                                                 Before step 5 can be completed, the cable needs to be marked at the correct
                                                 position. For this, the cable is held against the gland body that has been fitted to
                                                 the electrical enclosure.

            Using a hacksaw, cut all the way around the cable, cutting through the outer
            sheath; continue cutting until each of the armour wires is cut to a depth of
            approximately half. Be careful not to cut too deep and thus damage the insulation
            of the conductors, but make sure that all of the armour wires are cut or nicked.




            p	 Figure 4.198 Cutting the armour

            This step may also be accomplished by using an armoured cable-stripper, which
            looks rather like a pipe-cutter but has a blade to cut the outer sheath and score
            the armour wires.




            p	 Figure 4.199 Armoured cable-stripper in use

            Remove the outer sheath, down to the cut point, by using a stripping knife. Hold
            the cable end in one hand, hold the knife across the cable at a slight angle and cut
            the outer sheath, pushing away from you.

                                                   Now remove the armour wires from the cable. This is achieved by bending the
                                                   wires back and forth until they snap. Care must be taken to ensure that the
                                                   armour ends under the sheath are not distorted, otherwise there may be problems
                                                   when fitting the gland together.

                                                   At this stage the shroud should have been fitted to the cable. The upper part or
                                                   parts of the gland should now be slid over the cable.




                         INDUSTRY TIP
              To stop the gland sliding
              down the cable, the gland
              body can be pushed into the
              shroud or taped to the cable,
              with insulation tape.

            Step 7 Mark up and remove the outer sheath
            Once again the cable is offered up against the gland body, now fitted to the
            electrical enclosure, and a mark is made just above the top of the cone.




            p	 Figure 4.202 How to mark up the sheath

            At the mark, the outer sheath is cut right round the cable, using a knife, a hacksaw
            or a SWA stripper. The small piece of sheath is then removed.




            p	 Figure 4.203 Cable with sheath removed

            Step 8 Spread the armour strands
            The armour strands now need to be spread to fit over the cone of the gland. On
            smaller cables this can be accomplished holding the armour and rotating the cable
            against the direction of the wind of the armour. On larger cables, the strands may
            need to be spread apart, using a large, flat screwdriver. It is important to make
            sure that the ends of each armour strand are straight and that none of them
            crosses over another.

                                                   The cable is then passed through the gland body so that all the armour strands
                                                   sit over the cone. The upper part of the gland is slid down the cable and tightened
                                                   up to grip the armour. If a CW gland is fitted, the uppermost part of the gland is
                                                   tightened onto the sheath of the cable to form a seal. Finally, the shroud can be
                                                   fitted over the gland.

            In some cases, it is better to strip the inner core before fitting the gland together.
            Then, when passing the cable through the gland body, care must be taken to avoid
            damaging the insulation of the inner cores on the gland body.

                                              Step 1 Strip the outer sheath
                                              The cable outer sheath is removed at the correct position, ensuring that the outer
                                              sheath ends up inside the body of the gland. The outer sheath is removed, using a
                                              rotary stripper or an electrician’s knife. Care must be taken not to cut too deep, as
                                              the braid of the flex is made of fine strands of wire.

            When the gland is fitted to the enclosure, the pigtails fit into slots in the gland
            and are sandwiched between washers and the locknut.
            Whichever gland is used, the braid, even though it is not used as an earth, must be
            connected to the main earth terminal.

                                              This section covers the termination of four types of data cables:
                                              l	 Cat 5 & Cat 5e
              KEY TERM                        l	 Cat 6

              conductor to another,           The termination of Cat 5, Cat 5e and Cat 6 data cable
              through electro-magnetic        The termination of Cat 5 and Cat 5e cable is the same; the termination of Cat 6 is
              induction. Twisting pairs       very similar. These data cables are all twisted-pair type cables and usually contain
              of cable reduces this
              cross-talk.
                                              four pairs (eight cores). Each pair is twisted to reduce cross-talk and each pair
                                              within the cable has a different number of twists per metre.
                                              Within a data cable, the pairs are identified by:
                                              l	   one cable taking a solid colour with a white stripe
                                              l	   its pair being a white cable with the corresponding colour as its stripe.
                                              When terminating these twisted pair cables, it is important that the pairs are not
                                              untwisted any more than is necessary to terminate the cores; otherwise cross-talk
                                              could be an issue.
                                              For ‘electrically noisy environments’, shielded twisted pair cables (STP) are
                                              available. This section describes how to terminate unscreened twisted pair (UTP)
                                              cables that are commonly found within data installations. The table below shows

                                              Removing the outer jacket
                                              There is more than one method of removing the outer jacket of the data cable,
                                              but it is important to remove no more of the outer jacket than is absolutely
                                              necessary; about 50 mm is the ideal amount.
                                              Method 1, using the integral ripcord – Some twisted-pair data cables come
                                              with an integral ripcord, which looks like a piece of thread. A pair of side-cutters is
                                              used to make a small cut in the end of the cable, to expose the end of the rip cord.

            Carry on pulling the ripcord until the intended length of the jacket to remove is
            reached. Pull the inner cores out from the jacket and use a pair of side-cutters to
            cut away the jacket.
            Method 2, using a rotary stripper – The rotary stripper is passed over the end of
            the cable, to the point to which the outer jacket is to be stripped. The stripper is
            rotated to score the outer sheath, which is then removed from the cable.

                                              The outer jacket can then be pulled off the cable. The cable is now ready for
                                              terminating.

                                              Terminating the inner cores
                                              As mentioned earlier, inside the cable there are eight colour-coded cores, which
                                              are twisted to form four pairs of wires. Each pair has a common colour theme,
                                              with one conductor of the pair having a solid colour and the other conductor of
                                              the pair having a stripe to match the theme. There are two wiring standards for
                                              the connection of an RJ45 connector for twisted-pair cables, T568A and T568B,
                                              the difference being the sequence of connection of the cores.

                                              While it may not matter which standard is used, it is important to make sure
                                              that the same standard is used at both ends of the cable. It is also important to
                                              remember that:

               terminal                       connectors (IDC) which do not require the insulation of the cable to be stripped.
                                              This type of termination is common in the telecoms part of the industry and
                                              is used where the conductor size is very small, so that it is impractical to use a
                                              screw-type terminal. The terminal has two blades, positioned to form a V-shape.
                                              As the wire is pushed into the terminal, the blades cut into the insulation until
                                              they make contact with the conductor. A special termination tool trims the wire
                                              to the correct length, as well as ensuring the wire is pushed far enough into the
                                              terminal. These terminals are not very good at withstanding vibration and so are
                                              only used for fixed, permanent connections.

            Terminating to a patch panel – It is normal practice to leave enough slack on
            the cables to enable the patch panel to be pulled forward, out of the cabinet or
            rack, so that the terminations can be made on a solid surface. Trying to make the
            termination unsupported, in mid-air, is likely to result in faulty connections.

            modules. If the cables approach the patch panel from left to right, then terminate
            the cables to the ports nearest the left-hand side first, to avoid terminated cables
            getting in the way of those yet to be terminated.

                                                 The method of termination of Cat 6 cable is very similar to that for Cat 5 and Cat
                                                 5e cable, but with some noticeable differences. The major difference between
                                                 terminating Cat 6 cable and Cat 5 cables is the need to ensure that the pairs
                         INDUSTRY TIP            are separated from each other as much as possible. Within the cable, this is
                                                 accomplished by means of a divider, which forms an X-shape, with each pair

              and system noise.                  When terminating Cat 6 cables to a patch panel, the individual cables are kept
                                                 separate from each other.

            Once the cables have been installed they will require testing.
            Data cables are always improving. For example, the Cat 7 cable has recently been
            introduced, which has a larger csa than Cat 5 and individual pair screening.

            Fitting an RJ45 plug to a patch lead (Cat 5e)
            There may be times when there is a requirement to make up a patch lead. A straight-
            through patch lead has the same connections at each end. The cable used needs
            to have cores that are flexible. The plug has insulation-piercing connectors (IPC),
            which are basically pins that pierce the insulation. An RJ45 plug is not suitable for
            terminating solid core cable; the termination will suffer premature failure.

            Push the wires into the connector, making sure that they are still in the correct
            order and that they go right to the ends of the connector. The outer sheath should
            end up under the locking piece.

            Recheck that the cores are in the correct order. Carefully place the connector into
            the modular crimp tool and squeeze the handles tightly. The insulation piercing
            pins will pierce each of the eight wires and the locking tab that holds the outer
            plastic sheath will engage, securing the plug to the cable. Once both ends are

            Whatever type of connector is used, the termination process is similar. It is
            important that all dust is excluded from the termination. The environment when
            terminating fibre optics must be scrupulously clean. As the process of termination
            varies slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer, it is important to refer to
            manufacturer’s instructions before terminating the fibre optic.

                                              Safety considerations
                                              Never look down the end of a connected fibre, as this could result in serious eye
                                              damage. The light transmitted is in the infra-red spectrum and therefore invisible
                                              to the eye, but can cause serious damage. Ensure both ends of the fibre are
                                              disconnected or that the transmitter is switched off.
                                              When cutting the fibre, small glass shards are produced. If they get into the
                                              eye, they are very difficult to flush out. Safety glasses should be worn when
                                              terminating fibre-optic cables. Never eat, drink or smoke whilst terminating fibre
                                              optics, as this may lead to ingestion of glass particles.
                                              Some termination kits may use adhesives in the termination process so attention
                                              will need to be paid to COSHH data sheets.

                                              Method
                                              The method described below uses Lightcrimp Plus SC connectors from Tyco
                                              Electronics. As the connectors are pre-polished, there is no need for polishing and

            so that the end of the buffer is at the 8mm marking.




            Step 2 – While applying pressure on the buffer, carefully slide the fibre slide forwards (towards the carriage)
            until it stops.




            Step 3 – Gently close the fibre clamp, and slide the carriage forwards. DO NOT touch the button while sliding
            the carriage. Open the fibre clamp, and move the fibre slide back until it stops. Remove the cleaved fibre,
            and properly dispose of the scrap fibre.

              The arrows marked on the front die indicate the direction in which the ferrule or termination
              cover must be pointing when the connector is positioned in that cavity. For proper
              placement, and to avoid damage to the fibre, observe the direction of the arrows.

            After the termination is complete, the ferrule end-face must be inspected for
            cleanliness, using a 200 × microscope. See the paragraph at the beginning of this
            section about the dangers of looking down a fibre-optic cable.
            It can be seen from the foregoing that the process of terminating a fibre-optic
            cable is complex, but is a skill well worth obtaining. It is only by following the
            process and being scrupulously clean, that acceptable terminations can be made.

            extraneous conductive part to decide whether or not the item is an extraneous
            conductive part in a particular situation. For example, a structural steel beam
            supported on brick piers would not be regarded as an extraneous conductive part
            and would not require bonding, but a structural steel beam in contact with the
            ground is an extraneous conductive part that would require bonding.
            Metallic parts of the electrical installation are exposed conductive parts rather
            than extraneous conductive parts and these require earthing.

                                              Installing protective bonding
                                              When installing protective bonding to mains services, the following steps should
                                              be taken.
                                              1	   Select the correct size of protective bonding conductor.
                                              2	   Install the protective bonding conductor.
                                              3	   Make the correct choice of bonding clamp.
                                              4	   Install the bonding clamp.
                                              5	   Terminate the cable.

                                              Cable sizes
                                              The size of bonding conductor depends on the type of earthing system used.

                                              TN-S and TT systems
                                              For TN-S and TT systems the following criteria are used to determine the size of
                                              protective bonding conductors:
                                              l	 half the size of the earthing conductor
                                              l	 a minimum size of 6 mm2
                                                                             2
                                              l	 a maximum size of 25 mm .


                                              TN-C-S systems
                                              For TN-C-S (PME) systems the size of protective bonding conductors is
                                              determined in accordance with the size of the supply neutral and Table 54.8 of
                                              BS 7671 (reproduced below).

            BS 7671 does point out that local distributors’ network conditions may require a
            larger conductor for PME systems.

            Installation of main protective bonding conductors
            A main protective bonding conductor of the correct size should be run from the
            MET to the point of connection to the service to be bonded. The conductor used
            must be of the correct colour: green and yellow.

            Support of main protective bonding conductors
            Section 522 of BS 7671 requires that all cables are correctly supported throughout
            their length to avoid mechanical stresses on both the cable and the terminations.
            Gas, water and other service pipework should not be used as a method of support.
            Consideration needs to be given to this aspect, especially where the bonding cable is
            terminated to the service pipework to ensure that the protective bonding conductor
            does not become disconnected from the pipe clamp.

            Point of connection
            The connection of the bonding conductor to the service pipes                                  p	 Figure 4.243 Clipped bonding

                                              The ideal method of terminating the bonding conductor is by means of a cable lug
                                              of the correct size for the cable.

            Testing of bonding conductors
            Later in this chapter we look at how to carry out several tests that have to be
            performed on electrical installation work (starting on page 388). One of the tests                            INDUSTRY TIP
            is called ‘Continuity of protective conductors’. BS 7671 identifies that both main
                                                                                                                    Remember an extraneous
            and supplementary bonding conductors are included in this test.
                                                                                                                    conductive part is defined in
            There are two methods of continuity testing; for protective conductors such                             BS 7671 as a conductive part
            as bonding conductors, method 2 is preferred. The test method is covered on                             liable to introduce a potential,

            effectively connected to the extraneous conductive part.
            Before the continuity test can be performed, the bonding conductor must
            be disconnected from the MET or, in the case of supplementary bonding,
            disconnected from the relevant circuit protective conductor (cpc). With one end
            of the bonding disconnected, clean a part of the extraneous conductive part close
            to the clamp. (If the extraneous conductive part has been painted then the paint
            must be removed from a small part to expose the metal.) Place a test probe in
            direct contact with the clean metal.
            Now continue with the test method 2, using the long ‘wander lead’ (see page 392).


            4 INSPECTION AND TESTING
            It is a fundamental requirement of BS 7671 The IET Wiring Regulations that
            ‘during erection and on completion of an installation or an addition or alteration
            to an installation and before it is put into service, appropriate inspection and
            testing shall be carried out…’.
            Regulation 134.2.1 and Part 6 of BS 7671 gives the requirements for inspection
            and testing.




                                                                                                                                                  375

                                              Why carry out inspection and testing?
                                              The reason for carrying out initial verification is to ensure that the installation is
                                              safe to be put into service and that it meets the requirements of BS 7671.
                                              The fundamental principles that must be followed when completing an electrical
                                              installation are that:
                                              l	 good workmanship is employed
                                              l	 proper materials are used

                                              l	 equipment is installed in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.

                                              It is these principles that are being checked when carrying out an initial verification.

                                              Installation of electrical equipment
                                              Compliance with standards
                                              BS 7671 requires that any installed equipment complies with relevant British or
                                              equivalent standards. Other standard numbers that you may see on equipment
                                              are those relating to European Norms (EN) or to the standards of the International
                                              Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The same numbers are often used for
                                              equivalent standards, in combination with different prefixes. For example, the
                                              switch disconnector in a consumer unit may be marked as:
                                              l	 IEC 947-3
                                              l	 EN 60947-3
                                              l	 BS EN 60947-3.

                                              All three of these standards meet the requirements; in fact they are the same
                                              standard adopted in different parts of the world.

                                              There should no damage to installed electrical equipment. Damage could result in
                                              the exposure of live parts and a consequent risk of shock.

                                              Equipment suitable for its environment
                                              Wherever a piece of electrical equipment is installed, it must be suitable for
                                              that environment. The specification for installed equipment is drawn up by the
                                              designer. When inspecting equipment for an initial verification, you are checking
                                              that the installed equipment conforms to the designer’s instructions.
                                              The designer will have taken into account:
                                              l	 the environment where the equipment is to be installed
                                              l	 the construction and materials of the building
                                              l	 the intended use of the building

                                              l	 who will use the building.


                                              Equipment correctly installed
                                              There are two aspects to consider when installing electrical equipment.
                                              Equipment should be installed:
                                              l	   in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
                                              l	   in compliance with BS 7671.

            Where there is a conflict between the manufacturer’s instructions and BS 7671,
            the manufacturer should be consulted and will have final say. The reason for
            this is that the manufacturer will have designed their equipment to meet the
            requirements of all the applicable standards.

            Remember the safe isolation procedure
            Before any inspection and testing is carried out, the full isolation procedure
            should be carried out to ensure the installation is safe to be worked on, including
            inspection.
            Figure 4.265 provides a reminder of the procedure.

                                                    Here are some practical examples of the type of checks that would be carried out
                                                    for different scenarios.

                                                    Checks to make at a distribution board

            l	   are correctly sized for current capacity and voltage drop
            l	   are supported throughout their length to avoid strain on cables and
                 terminations

            Checks to make on a protective bonding conductor connected
            to a service pipe
            Check that the conductor is:
            l	   the correct size
            l	   coloured yellow and green
            l	   correctly supported

            l	   correctly terminated and that connections are tight.

            Testing
            Testing follows inspection and involves documenting test values for each circuit,
            which are recorded on a Schedule of Test Results. Many abbreviations are used on
            test record sheets and below is a guide to some of those abbreviations.

                                              Testing an installation – the sequence of tests
                                              When testing electrical installations, the prescribed sequence of tests is broken
                         INDUSTRY TIP         down into two distinct groups:
              When rewiring some              1	 tests carried out before the installation is connected to the supply (dead tests)
              installations it is necessary   2	 tests carried out after the installation is connected to the supply (live tests).
              to connect the circuits         This section deals with the tests to be carried out before the circuit or installation
              before the whole installation
                                              is connected to the supply.
              is complete. In these
              circumstances the new           BS 7671 requires that these tests are carried out in a set sequence. The reasons
              circuits should be tested       for this are:
              before they are connected to
                                              l	 to ensure safety
              ensure that they are safe.
                                              l	 that some tests rely on achieving a pass in a previous test to give an accurate

                                                 result
                                              l	 to minimise the amount of retesting if a particular test indicates a fault.

                                              The prescribed sequence of tests prior to connection to the supply is as follows:
              ACTIVITY
              Which test is also covered      1	    continuity of protective conductors, including main and supplementary bonding
              by the R1 + R2 continuity       2	    continuity of ring final circuit conductors
              test?                           3	    insulation resistance
                                              4	    polarity.
                                              Should any of the tests indicate a failure, the following procedure should be
                                              adopted:
                                              1	 the fault should be rectified
                                              2	 any previous tests that may have been influenced by the result should be repeated
                                              3	 the test that indicated the fault should be repeated.
                                              For example, a failed insulation resistance test indicates that a fault exists
                                              between neutral and cpc. Once the fault has been corrected, the continuity of
                                              the circuit protective conductor test should be repeated as an open cpc may have
                                              been masked by the insulation resistance fault.

                                              Instruments and instrument preparation
                                              To carry out the ‘dead’ tests a low-resistance ohmmeter and an insulation
                                              resistance tester are required.

                                              Low-resistance ohmmeter
                                              A low-resistance ohmmeter is used to verify the continuity of conductors and the
                                              correct polarity of circuits.

            Prior to carrying out any tests, the instrument must be checked to ensure:
            l	 it is not damaged in any way
            l	 it is still within its calibration date
            l	 the batteries are OK

            l	 the leads and crocodile clips are undamaged

            l	 the instrument functions properly.

            To ensure that accurate readings are obtained, the instrument test leads (and
            any long leads that are to be used for the tests) should be ‘nulled’. Alternatively,
            a measurement can be made of the test leads’ resistance so that this can be
            subtracted from the test measurements.
            The low-resistance ohmmeter gives results in ohms (Ω). Normally, results are very          p	 Figure 4.266 Low-resistance
            low and to a resolution of two decimal places.                                                ohmmeter

            Insulation resistance tester
            As its name suggests, an insulation resistance tester is used to measure insulation
            resistance.
            Prior to carrying out insulation resistance tests, the insulation resistance tester
            must be checked to ensure:
            l	   it is not damaged in any way
            l	   it is still within its calibration date
            l	   the batteries are okay
            l	   the leads and crocodile clips are undamaged
            l	   the instrument functions properly.
            The insulation resistance tester gives results in megohms (MΩ). Insulation
            resistance testers have either a single voltage setting or multiple voltage settings.
            It is therefore important to ensure that the correct voltage range is selected.
            Remember that the insulation resistance tester uses a voltage that can damage
            electronic equipment and may hurt the user.
            In many cases, a low-resistance ohmmeter and an insulation resistance tester are
            incorporated into one test instrument, or are part of a multi-function tester. It is
            important, therefore, to ensure that the correct instrument setting is selected and that
            you are fully aware of the correct operation of the test instrument in each function.

                                              Testing continuity of protective conductors
                                              The purpose of this test is to ensure that protective conductors are continuous
                                              (without breaks) and of a suitably low resistance.
                                              The term ‘protective conductor’ encompasses the following conductors:

            Regulation 411.3.1.1 requires that where automatic disconnection is used as a
            means of protection against electric shock, every circuit must have a cpc which is
            run to and terminated at each and every point in the circuit. An exception is made
            for an insulated lampholder suspended from a point which has a cpc connected,
            for example an insulated pendant set.
            Two test methods can be used to verify the continuity of protective conductors.

            Test method 1
            A temporary link is made between the line conductor and the protective
            conductor at the distribution board. For new circuits, it is best practice to do this
            before the circuit is connected to the distribution board. This can be achieved with
            a connector block or with a short lead that has a crocodile clip at each end.

            Using a low-resistance ohmmeter, a test is made between line and earth terminals
            at each point in the circuit. The highest measurement obtained is recorded on
            the schedule of test results as R1 + R2. The value of the reading depends on
            the length of the circuit and the cross-sectional area of the circuit conductors.
            Readings should increase as the test points become increasingly distant from the
            distribution board.
            If a test at any point fails to provide a reading, check if any switch in the line
            conductor is switched to the ‘on’ position. If there is still no reading, this indicates
            that there is an open circuit in the line or protective conductor of the circuit; this     p	 Figure 4.270 Testing at point

              value of R2 be?
                                              It can be nulled with the instrument test leads or its resistance measured and
                                              subtracted from the test results.
                                              This method could be used to test circuit protective conductors which would
                                              result in a value for R2 but it is more practicable to use method 1 when testing
                                              circuits.

                                              Testing of main protective bonding conductors
                                              Method 2 is the most appropriate method to test the continuity of main
                                              protective bonding conductors. The test should be carried out with a low-
                                              resistance ohmmeter and a long test lead. The instrument test leads and the long
                                              lead are nulled. The main protective bonding conductor is disconnected from the
                                              MET and one end of the long lead is connected to the disconnected protective
                                              bonding conductor. The long lead is then run out to the point where the other end
                                              of the protective bonding conductor is connected to the extraneous conductive
                                              part. A test is made using a low-resistance ohmmeter between the end of the
                                              long lead and the protective bonding conductor. A low resistance reading indicates
                                              continuity of the protective bonding conductor. On completion, the long lead is
                                              disconnected and the protective bonding conductor is connected to the MET.
                                              This method would also be used when testing the continuity of the earthing
                                              conductor.
                                              When using this method, bear in mind that running a long lead out when testing
                                              could result in a trip hazard.

            It can be seen from the table that when testing the continuity of circuit protective
            conductors, the most appropriate method is test method 1 and that when testing
            the continuity of a single protective conductor test method 2 is the most suitable                INDUSTRY TIP
            method.

            So, what is meant by the term ‘parallel path’? A parallel path refers to any conductive     installation: all the bonding
            path that is not the intended earth path and which forms an alternative to the              conductors, water and gas
            intended path. For example, a parallel path occurs where a separate cpc is run              supplies to a boiler, cpc to
            within metallic trunking or conduit which is not the intended cpc. When testing the         immersion heaters and water
                                                                                                        pipes, washing machines,
            continuity of the cpc, it would be necessary to eliminate this parallel path to ensure
                                                                                                        showers, and so on.
            that only the intended cpc is tested. If the parallel path is not eliminated, the value
            of R1 + R2 will be artificially low. The parallel path can be eliminated by disconnecting
            one end of the conductor under test as shown in Figure 4.272.

                                                    The purpose of this test is to verify that the ring final circuit conductors form a

                                                    For this test, a low-resistance ohmmeter is used. Before carrying out the test
                                                    it is important to ‘null’ or zero the leads to get accurate test results. The ideal
                                                    time to carry out this test is after the sockets have been connected but prior to
                                                    connecting the ends of the ring final circuit to the distribution board.
                                                    This test consists of three separate steps. It is important that all three steps are
                                                    carried out to ensure that all possible faults are identified.

              EXAMPLE
              A ring final circuit is wired in 2.5 mm2 live conductors with a 1.5 mm2 cpc. The
              line loop (r1) has been measured as 0.85 Ω. The expected reading for r2 will be:

                   0.85 × 2.5 = 1.42 Ω
                      1.5
              From the example, it can be seen that the ratio of the csa of the live and cpc
              conductors determines how much higher the reading is for the cpc loop. In this
              case, 2.5/1.5 means that r2 will be 1.67 times higher than r1.
              A failure to get a reading on any of the loops indicates a break in the ring. A
              substantially different reading from the expected for any of the loops will need
              investigating.


            Step 2
            The open ends of the line and neutral are connected together so that the line
            of leg 1 is connected to the neutral of leg 2 and the line of leg 2 is connected to
            the neutral of leg 1. A test is carried out between line and neutral at each socket
            outlet.

            9	 line 3 and earth
            10	neutral and earth.
            The number of points of testing can be reduced by linking some of the conductors
            together. For example, if L1, L2, L3 and neutral were linked and a test carried out
            between these linked conductors and earth, that’s four of the tests done in one
            go.
            See examples of testing below.

            Example 1: Testing a single lighting circuit
            Carry out the pre-test checks. Using an insulation resistance tester with the
            test voltage set to 500 V, test between line and neutral. Operate any two-way
            switches and test again to ensure that all strappers are tested. Test between live
            conductors and earth. Operate any two-way switches to ensure there are no
            shorts between the strappers and earth. Make sure the readings are not below
            1 MΩ. Record the readings on the Schedule of Test Results.

            Polarity
            Polarity must be checked to ensure that:
            l	 all fuses, single-pole switches and circuit breakers are connected to the line
               conductor
            l	 Edison screw (ES) lampholders are connected with the line conductor to the

               centre pin of the lampholder (not applicable to E14 and E27 types complying
               with BS EN 60238 as per Regulation 559.5.1.206 of BS 7671
            l	 socket outlets and similar accessories are correctly connected.

            If a single-pole switch is connected to the neutral rather than the line conductor, a
            piece of electrical equipment would appear to be switched off but, in fact, would
            be live – an extremely dangerous situation.

                                              If a fuse of a single-pole circuit breaker is installed in the neutral, in the case of a
                                              line–earth fault, the path of fault current flow would bypass the protective device.
                                              This would cause damage to the circuit conductors and, more importantly, make
                                              live the casings of Class I equipment.

                                              2	 a visual check of core colours at all terminations throughout the circuit.
                                              The test using a low-resistance ohmmeter is similar to the test used for verifying

                                              would be carried out on a lighting circuit.

                         Note: The test may be carried out either at lighting points or switches

                 Remember to remove the temporary shorting link when testing is complete

            p	 Figure 4.282 Polarity testing

            A temporary link is made between the line conductor and the protective
            conductor at the distribution board. Using a low-resistance ohmmeter, and with
            the light switch in the closed position, a test is made between line and earth
            terminals at the light fitting. When the switch is opened, the low-resistance
            ohmmeter will indicate an open circuit and thus show that the switch has
            broken the line conductor. This test will be combined with a visual inspection to
            determine that the cpc is connected to the correct terminal.
            In practice, this method would be incorporated into the testing of the continuity
            of the cpc.
            It should also be noted that when testing the continuity of ring final circuit
            conductors by testing to the front of socket outlets, if satisfactory results are
            obtained in all three steps of the test, the polarity is also confirmed.
            Following these tests, the installation or circuit is ready to be connected to the
            supply, after which a series of live tests are carried out before certification is
            completed and the installation handed over to the client.
            Testing functionality of a circuit is different to functional testing of an electrical
            installation. At Level 2, you are required to be able to demonstrate simple ‘dead
            tests’ of circuits as described in this outcome. During continuity and polarity
            testing, switches and devices may be operated to see if they open and close
            circuits as intended. Any testing of circuits involving a supply must only be done
            under strict supervision.

            The architect is usually responsible for all elements of architectural or building
            design including the specification of building form, structure, fire strategy,
            orientation, and interior and exterior design to meet client requirements, planning
            conditions and building regulation requirements. Generally, the architect does not
            carry out any special mechanical or electrical design works but is responsible for
            the final co-ordination of the building services fixtures in terms of reflected ceiling
            plans (indicating lights, grilles and architectural features).
            In specialist projects or where the task requirements are challenging, the client
            may employ specialist designs from the other members of the design team,
            including structural engineers, landscape architects, fire engineers and specialist
            planning consultants. In these instances, the architect is normally the design team
            leader. Sometimes, where the architect is part of a large organisation, specialist
            engineers in these roles may be employed by that organisation.

            The building services engineer is responsible for the mechanical and electrical
            services in a project, often referred to as MEP.
            ●	 Mechanical services include heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
            ●	 Electrical services include lighting, power and distribution, as well as

               telecommunications, fire alarms, alarm and communication systems,
               intercoms and disabled refuge communication systems.
            ●	 The ‘P’ in MEP stands for plumbing and public health engineering, including hot

               and cold pipework, above ground drainage and, in certain contracts, private
               underground systems prior to input into the public sewer.
            The building services engineer designs any rainwater systems that run internally,
            whereas the architect designs the external rainwater systems (pipes on the
            exterior from gutter to ground level drain).

            Sub-contractors
            Each sub-contractor is responsible for their package of work or construction
            discipline, such as substructure or ground work, joinery, brickwork, window
            installation, electrical, plumbing, plastering or decorating. They have to work safely,
            to the main contractor’s construction programme, producing work that meets the
            specification, in a timely manner and accommodates the contractor and all the
            other sub-contractors working on site. In the majority of construction contracts,
            the sub-contractor is a ‘domestic sub-contractor’, who only works for a main
            contractor. Therefore, the sub-contractor can only be instructed by the contractor
            as they have no contractual link with the client or the client’s team.

            Site supervisor
            The site supervisor can also be known as the general foreman. On smaller
            projects, they are main point of contact for all trades. On larger projects, this
            role is generally carried out by the construction manager, to whom the site
            supervisor reports. In some organisations, site supervisors are known as assistant
            construction managers.

            Trade supervisor
            The trade supervisor is normally the foreman or lead person for each sub-
            contractor. This person usually controls the individual trade operatives on site,

            Electrical services inspector
            The title ‘electrical services inspector’ is rarely used in the UK as the majority
            of installations are self-certified by the installing contractor. The inspector is
            normally Level 3 qualified, with specific qualifications in the inspection and testing
            of electrical installations.                                                              KEY TERM

            Legislation
            Every industry has to comply with legislation that is specific to that industry.
            The construction industry is no exception: there are specific construction safety
            laws as well as the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations, which
            put duties on all stakeholders. However, much of the health and safety and
            employment legislation applies to all industries.

                                              projects the preliminaries also include the cost of site set-up and maintenance of
                                              items such as welfare and storage cabins, given as a cost per day or per week.

                                              Scope of works
                                              The preliminaries are normally followed by a scope of works. This section
                                              determines the extents of the specification (i.e. the extent of what the contractor
                                              has to quote a price for). If the contract is agreed, the scope of works will become
                                              the extent of works to be carried out.
                                              For example, a simplified scope of works may be:
                                                 ‘The scope of works for this project is to install electrical systems within
                                                 a new two-storey extension to an existing four-bedroom house. The
                                                 works will include all wiring and containment systems for power, lighting
                                                 and distribution. The works will not include the intruder alarm or fire
                                                 detection systems.’
                                              Although this scope of works immediately eliminates the fire and intruder alarm
                                              detection, there will be interfaces between systems that need to be defined.
                                              These are generally included in the particular specification and drawings that
                                              follow this section.

                                              Specification of works
                                              This section describes the particular works to be carried out. It gives as much detail
                                              as possible of what the designer and client require for that particular package of
                                              works. It may consist of simple descriptions or technical requirements laid down
                                              for the contractor (tenderer) to price and eventually work to.

                                              Materials and workmanship
                                              Also known as the standard specification, this section is usually the same for
                                              all projects. It comprises a list of requirements in terms of workmanship and
                                              selection of material grades and quality that applies to each job, along with any
                                              British Standards or industry codes of practice that may be applicable.

            Schedules
            This section includes drawing issue sheets indicating which drawings have
            been issued as part of the tender or contract. It also contains other schedules
            such as equipment schedules containing manufacturer selections, performance
            requirements, sizes and weights, and distribution board schedules.

            Plans or drawings
            Most construction projects communicate contractual needs and design intent on
            drawings. These are provided in many formats, described in detail in Chapter 3,
            pages 163–71, and give different levels of detail depending on the purpose of the
            drawing and the technical requirements it needs to show.

            Work programmes
            A work programme is initially drawn up by the client or the client’s quantity
            surveyor to help determine the construction period and whether the scheme is
            feasible and affordable in the client’s timeframe.
            Once a contract has been awarded, the responsibility for the work programme
            lies with the contractor. On larger projects and in larger construction companies,
            planners are dedicated to producing large construction programmes.

                                              Policy documents
                                              Organisations, such as electrical contracting companies, will hold a range of policy
                                              documents setting out procedures that they and employees must follow. These
                                              could range from health and safety policies to quality control or employees’ rights
                                              and disciplinary procedures.
                                              The purpose of a policy is to provide a framework that can be followed so people
                                              working for the organisation can get on with the work they need to without
                                              having to constantly check or discuss the best way forward. Policies are written to
                                              ensure the organisation:
                                              ●	 meets legal requirements
                                              ●	 meets regulatory requirements
                                              ●	 improves quality

                                              ●	 promotes best practice.

                                              In some situations, new employees are issued with company policies and have
                                              to sign them as a way of agreeing to work to those policies. If an organisation
                                              changes their policy, the employee is trained on those new policies and once
                                              again, signs them to agree to follow them.

                                              Information given to customers
                                              There is a range of information the client receives before, during and at the
                                              handover stage of a contract. Knowing the difference is essential in order to meet
                                              legal requirements as well as maintaining good relationships.

                                              Quotations
                                              Quotations are generally offers to provide goods and/or services for specific
                                              amounts of money. They may have general terms and conditions attached, which
                                              are normally printed on the reverse of a quotation. Typical terms and conditions
                                              are that the quotation is only valid for 30 days and that the title (ownership) of
                                              any fitted goods does not pass to the recipient until full payment has been made.
                                              A quotation may also include specific terms, which define the detail of what has
                                              been quoted for and on what basis. An example would be to rewire a specific
                                              property as indicated on a specific drawing for a specific sum of money excluding
                                              VAT and that the property will be vacant with all fixings and furniture removed by
                                              the owner prior to work commencing.
                                              If all the terms and conditions are met and the requirements do not change from
                                              those specified in the drawing, the quoted price will stand regardless of how long
                                              the contractor takes to carry out the work or how profitable the work is. If there
                                              is a change in the terms and conditions, the price should be adjusted and agreed
                                              accordingly.

                                              Estimates
                                              Estimates are generally provided when the job is not properly measurable due
                                              to time or physical restrictions and therefore a quotation cannot be given. The

            necessary based on an estimated cost.

            Invoices, applications for payment and statements
            Invoices are formal requests for payment from one party to another. An invoice
            will normally contain the name and address of the customer, the trading name
            and office address of the contractor and any customer order or reference
            numbers. The registered office address and VAT registration number are given for
            limited companies. The invoice will also describe the works and give a breakdown
            of any non-fixed fee items.
            Business invoices usually request payment within 30 days. In order to avoid
            delays in payment, it is important to ensure that the invoice is correctly detailed.
            Any areas of additional works should already have been agreed and be clearly
            identified on the invoice.
            The contractor raising an invoice owes any tax or VAT to the Government from
            the date of the invoice regardless of the date of payment. In order to avoid paying
            out tax and VAT long before payment, especially where payment terms are 60
            or 90 days, the contractor can make an application for payment. This is identical
            to an invoice, giving the expected tax and VAT payment date but not the VAT
            number. The client sends the application for payment through the payment


                                                                                                                               427

                                              date of payment.
                                              A statement is a notification of outstanding invoices or transactions. Where a
                                              contractor and client have a long-standing relationship, it is possible for several
                                              invoices to be outstanding over a payment period. A statement is therefore issued
                                              to act as a reminder and reduce the possibility of confusion about what has and
                                              has not been paid. Alternatively, where there is a credit account arrangement,
                                              the contractor will build up a number of transactions before issuing an invoice for
                                              payment. During the billing period, the unpaid transactions can be itemised on a
                                              statement.

                                              Statutory cancellation rights
                                              Cancellation rights give the consumer the rights, within a specified period of time,
                                              to cancel a contract without liability or having to take legal action and to get back
                                              any money paid. In the UK, the Cancellation of Contracts made in a Consumer’s

                                              As a general guide, the following are typical areas where statutory cancellation
                                              rights exist:
                                              ●	 where the consumer cannot examine the purchase before they buy (i.e.
                                                 distance selling by mail order, phone or internet)
                                              ●	 where the trader can unduly pressurise customers to buy

                                              ●	 where the consumer has little opportunity to compare different traders or read

            Company working policies and procedures
            Companies set out working policies and procedures so that all workers can expect
            to be treated fairly and with respect, know how they can put right a problem
            should one arise and understand what measures or sanctions will be imposed
            should a breach of policies and procedures occur.
            Working policies and procedures set out a company’s expectations on matters
            such as:
            ●	 behaviour – language and attitude should promote safety and client
               relationships, for example
            ●	 timekeeping – poor timekeeping by one person can affect many members of

               staff and ultimately affect costs and completion targets
            ●	 dress code – should promote a professional image.

            These working policies become part of the terms and conditions of employment.
            They are often provided in a staff handbook, although such a handbook is not
            required by law. An employee accepts the terms and conditions of employment

            of the terms of the contract.

            Contract of employment
            A contract of employment is a legally binding agreement between employer and
            employee. It can be a verbal or written contract, including various terms and
            conditions. Any changes to the terms of employment will probably not be notified
            in a new contract of employment, but in the staff handbook, in a letter or on the
            company notice board.
            If the contract is verbal, the employer must give a statement of the main terms
            and conditions within two months of the start of employment, under the
            provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
            The statement would include:
            ●	 holidays entitlements
            ●	 scale of pay

            Oral communication is less formal than written communication. Although oral
            communication can be legally binding, it is difficult to record and prove, and it
            can easily become confused and lead to mistakes. Therefore, most important oral
            communications are followed up in writing, usually referring to the date and time
            of the original communication.

              ACTIVITY
              While you are at your training centre, imagine you are a client who wants some
              items of equipment installed at various heights within the building or room you
              are in. This could be things like socket outlets at 500 mm above the floor, a
              particular type of light located in a particular location, and so on. Make a list
              containing around ten items.
              Now orally communicate these requirements to a friend or colleague at the
              centre – but they must not write them down. Several minutes later, ask the
              friend or colleague to repeat the requirements back to you. How much did they
              remember?


            Written communication
            Written communication is any form of non-verbal communication in a written
            form. Written communication can come in many forms and using many different
            mediums (channels of communication), including letters, emails and SMS text
            messages.

                                                important to be polite and patient, and to check understanding where
                                                necessary. Use of dialect and colloquial terminology – like very informal,
                                                regional, or slang terms – should be avoided.

            When communicating with those with learning difficulties, it is important to
            remember that everyone has different communication needs, and language must                     INDUSTRY TIP

            Conflicts between clients and site operatives should be rare if clear
            communication is maintained. However, if problems occur and communication
            breaks down, the company needs to ensure that the client is not offended and
            everything is done to resolve the situation.

              ACTIVITY
              Try this activity with a small group. One of the group accuses the other of
              stealing a personal tool but the person being accused believes the owner has
              simply lost that tool.
              Consider the best forms of communication to resolve this conflict and consider the
              best approach by others so the conflict doesn’t get worse. Discuss this as a group.

            Synoptic assessment
            Part of your qualification requires a synoptic assessment, to test your skills as a
            whole. These assessments are based on a particular electrical installation and an
            ‘assignment brief’ that generally outlines the assignment scenario.
            The synoptic task is normally broken down into separate parts.
            Below is an example of what you can expect to see for a synoptic assignment,
            along with some tips about completing the non-practical tasks.


            ASSIGNMENT BRIEF
            A new art studio is to be built within the grounds of a forty-year-old house, as
            shown on the next page. The studio is constructed of concrete block work, with a
            tile hung roof on a wooden truss.
            The studio requires an electrical installation which you must plan and install. The
            installation should follow and adhere to all relevant Health and Safety legislation
            and procedures.
            The studio is to be supplied using a three-core 25 mm2 thermoplastic SWA cable
            from the existing 230 V single-phase installation, utilising a spare way in the
            distribution board, located in the garage attached to the house. The distribution
            circuit will be supplied by a 40 A Type B 30 mA RCBO. The SWA cable is to be
            installed in a pre-excavated trench as shown on the drawing.
            Wiring systems within the new studio are as follows:
            ●	   dado trunking to be installed at 900 mm above finished floor level around the
                 perimeter of the studio
            ●	   conduit to be installed to supply 3 × 1200 × 600 mm luminaires on a suspended
                 ceiling
            ●	   6 × twin socket outlets to be mounted directly on the trunking, as located on
                 the drawing
            ●	   conduit to be installed to supply multi-gang single pole switch at a height of
                 1200 mm, as shown on drawing
            ●	   conduit to be installed to supply all outside lighting to a height of 2000 mm
            ●	   distribution board located in the studio, to be mounted above the trunking.
            The equipment used in the studio will include small power appliances such as
            hand-held heat guns or glue guns. No appliance will operate for long durations or
            have power consumption greater than 1.5 kW.
            The distribution circuit has a calculated voltage drop of 2 V.

                                         QUALIFICATIONS
                                         You are completing one of the following qualifications:
                                         l	 Level 2 Diploma in Electrical Installation (2365-02)
                                         l	 Level 2 Technical Certificate in Electrical Installation (8202-20)
                                         l	 T Level Technical Qualification in Building Services Engineering for

                                            Construction (8710)
                                         l	 Level 3 Electrotechnical Qualification (installation or maintenance) (5357-03).

                                         These qualifications aim to equip you with the practical skills and technical
                                         knowledge necessary to help you gain employment within the industry, or
                                         progress your training within the current apprenticeship route.
                                         Alternatively, you may be trying to progress to the Level 3 Technical Certificate
                                         (8202-30) as a means of progressing to further education at Level 4 and above.
                                         Whatever route you wish to take, these qualifications fully integrate with each
                                         other, allowing seamless progression.


                                         HOW TO BECOME AN ELECTRICIAN
                                         To become a fully recognised electrician, you must complete the following:
                                         l	 5357-03 knowledge units
                                         l	 5357-03 on-site performance units
                                         l	 Achievement Measurement Test 2 (AM2S) synoptic end test.

                         INDUSTRY TIP    In addition, on completion of the above, you may also gain EngTech recognition
                                         from the Engineering Council through a fast-track process, as the on-site

              website.                   this recognition. That means you can use the EngTech abbreviation after your
                                         name, showing professional recognition.
                                         If you are not currently enrolled on the Electrotechnical Qualification (5357-03),
                                         do not worry. You can transfer your skills gained through the Diploma or Technical
                                         Certificate towards the 5357 knowledge units, meaning you will not need to
                                         complete all of the assessments.
                                         The 5393 Domestic Electrician Apprenticeship was introduced in September 2022
                                         as an alternative apprenticeship to the 5357 route, specifically for those who work
                                         solely in domestic dwellings. The unit structure is very much the same as 5357.
                                         The easiest way to explain your progression route is to show each qualification
                                         side by side (see Figure 6.1).

                                              Why are there different routes?
                                              The route you take into a career as an electrician will depend on a number of
                                              factors, such as your age, employment status and where you live within the UK.
                                              l	 Learners who are 16–19 and not employed full time within the electrical
                                                 industry would enrol on 8202-20 or 8710-353.
                                              l	 Adult learners wishing to become electricians would enrol on 2365-02.

                                              l	 Apprentices of any age working within the electrical industry would enrol on

                                                 5357-03 to become full electricians, or 5393 to become domestic electricians.

                                              How to achieve your qualification
                                              The requirements for successfully obtaining your qualification depend on which
                                              programme you are enrolled on.

                                              8710 T Levels
                                              T Levels are nationally recognised qualifications that are equivalent to 3 A Levels
                                              but focus on specific careers in industry. T Levels are two-year full-time courses of
                                              study.
                                              As well as classroom- and workshop-based learning, 8710-353 (Electrical
                                              Engineering) or 8710-352 (Electrical and Electronic Equipment) provide, within the
                                              course, nine weeks of work experience with an employer.
                                              The courses share a core unit that looks at the common elements across building
                                              services and this serves as a great insight into other occupational specialisms,
                                              including the science behind them. So, as well as learning about the electrical
                                              industry, students will also learn much about the other building services such as
                                              air-conditioning systems, heating, etc. In addition, the course covers the specific
                                              specialism content which is covered in this book.
                                              At the time of writing, it is anticipated that the T Levels will integrate into the
                                              5357 apprenticeship in the same way as 8202 and 2365. Figure 6.1 shows the
                                              progression route with T Levels.

                                              8202-20
                                              Level 2 is assessed using one on-screen multiple-choice examination and one
                                              practical synoptic assignment.
                                              For the synoptic assignment, a typical brief might be to install a cable and wiring
                                              system. You will need to draw on skills and understanding developed across
                                              the qualification content in order to consider the specific requirements of the
                                              particular wiring system and related electrical principles, and carry out the brief.
                                              This includes the ability to plan tasks, such as marking out and cutting cables, and
                                              apply the appropriate practical and hand skills to carry them out using appropriate
                                              tools and equipment.
                                              You will also demonstrate that you are following health and safety regulations at
                                              all times by drawing upon your knowledge of legislation and regulations.

            HOW TO APPROACH THE
            SYNOPTIC ASSESSMENT
            Make sure you study the drawings and brief carefully and take in all information.
            Anything not mentioned may be assumed. It is always a good idea to list these
            assumptions as you go.
            Use the scales on the drawings to measure the quantity of materials, and to get
            an idea of how long the circuits will be. Circuit lengths may dictate how many
            circuits there are in the installation.

            Task 1a: Produce and complete a circuit
            schedule and divide the installation into
            circuits, giving reasons for your decisions
            There is no single correct way to divide this installation into circuits. Assumptions
            need to be made on the loading but, as mentioned in the brief, this will be low.
            Whatever approach is taken, justify the reasons why you have taken that
            approach. For example, a four-way distribution board could be used to
            accommodate:
            ●	 × 2 16 A radial circuits for the socket outlets
            ●	 × 1 6 A lighting circuit for all indoor and outdoor lighting

            ●	 × 1 spare way.

            The reasoning for dividing the socket outlets into two circuits is to allow for one
            to remain working should the other fail. This also splits loading and allows for
            smaller csa cables.
            Other options will also work, such as using one ring-final or one radial circuit with
            a higher rating.
            Use Table 7.1 in the IET On-Site Guide to check maximum circuit lengths and use
            this data as part of your justification. From this, select suitable conductor sizes.
            Consider what devices are needed for circuit protection in the studio and again,
            justify your choice. Consider if RCD protection is needed when the distribution
            circuit already has RCD protection. Think about the type of circuit breaker which is
            needed, such as Type B or C, and again, write down reasons why you have chosen
            the specific type.

            Task 1b: Produce a plant and materials list,
            justifying the choices and decisions made
            For this part of the task, it is important to make good use of technical terms for
            items so you can demonstrate recall and understanding. As a tip, use the key on
            the drawing for information.

                                              What type are the socket outlets, twin or two-gang? What finish are they? What
              KEY TERM
                                              are they mounted on and therefore what accessories are needed for them to fix
              Two-gang socket outlet:         into the trunking?
              most people will call it
              a twin or double socket         Use the scales to estimate the lengths of trunking, conduit, cable, etc., needed.
              but the correct term is         While you need to be as detailed as possible with your list, small sundries such as
              two-gang.                       screws and small fixings do not need to be listed.
                                              As well as materials, the task asks for plant needed, and this could include drills
                                              for drilling fixings and holes in the building to pass wiring through and other
                                              cutting equipment.
                                              Make sure you make justifications for equipment and plant. Not everything needs
                                              justifying as some things are given, such as the luminaires. However, consider other
                                              items such as cable csa; this can be justified by referencing Table 7.1 of the IET OSG.
                                              Consider what type of distribution board you will choose. Will it be metal or
                                              insulated plastic? As it is not located in a dwelling, it does not need to be metal,
                                              but metal does offer better fire protection.
                                              As well as conduit and trunking lengths, consider what further accessories are
                                              needed, for example, conduit draw-in boxes such as tee boxes, terminal boxes, as
                                              well as saddles. Are trunking bends internal, external, flat, etc.?

                                              Task 1c: Produce a method statement for
                                              the safe isolation procedure
                                              This task requires you to provide a step-by-step method of how the safe isolation
                                              procedure would be applied for this installation.
                                              As the installation is single-phase, the three-step test approach is necessary,
                                              rather than the three-phase ten-point test.
                                              Think about the task in stages such as preparation, proving suitability of
                                              equipment, undertaking the isolation and ensuring security of isolation. Once
                                              broken into stages, think carefully about what needs to be done, in what order, for
                                              each.
                                              For example, the preparation stage might involve, among other things:
                                              ●	 identifying the correct device for isolation
                                              ●	 seeking permission from the client to turn off the power
                                              ●	 ensuring all equipment and devices are compatible, such as lock off kits

                                              ●	 considering the implications of isolation, such as loss of power to other

                                                 services or systems.
                                              Once you have planned all the steps for all the stages and have checked that the
                                              order is logical, you can finish the method statement. This may be handwritten or
                                              typed.
