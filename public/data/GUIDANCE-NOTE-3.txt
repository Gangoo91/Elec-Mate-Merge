        Preface


                        This Guidance Note is one of a number of publications prepared by the Institution
                        of Engineering and Technology (IET) t o explain a n d enlarge upon the requirements
                        in BS 7671:2018+A2:2022, Requirements               for Electrical   Installations,   IET Wiring
                        Regulations. BS 7671 is a joint publication      o f the British Standards Institution and the
                        Institution of Engineering and Technology. All references to B S 7 6 7 1 in the text o f this
                        Guidance Note are references t o the current 18th Edition o f the IET Wiring Regulations,
                        unless otherwise noted.


                        From herein, BS 7671 :2018+A2:2022 is referred to as BS7671. T h e year reference will
                        only b e included where there is a need to reference a requirement           m a d e in an earlier
                        edition, such as BS 7671:2008.


                        Note that use of this Guidance Note does alone n o t provide compliance withBS7671.
                        Its content is intended       to explain some of the requirements        of BS 7671. Readers
                        should always consult BS 7671 to satisfy themselves           of compliance and must rely
                        upon their o w n skill and judgement w h e n making use of the guidance provided within
                        this publication.


                        The scope generally follows that of BS7671; t h e relevant regulations and appendices
                        are noted in the margin. Due to the introduction         in 2 0 1 6 of CENELEC Harmonized
                        Document (HD) 6 0 3 6 4 - 6 covering inspection and testing, the clause numbering              in
                        B S 7 6 7 1 aligns with that in the HD. As a result, Chapters 61 to 6 3 are n o t used; the
                        text o f Part 6 of BS 7 6 7 1 starts at Chapter 6 4 . Apart f r o m the testing of insulation
                        resistance a n d residual current devices (RCDs), the requirements          for inspection and
                        testing have not significantly changed f r o m BS 7671 :201 8.


                        Some Guidance Notes also contain material not currently included i n BS 7671, but
                        which was present in earlier editions of the Wiring Regulations. All o f the Guidance
                        Notes contain references to other relevant sources of information.


                        Electrical installations in the United Kingdom       that comply w i t h BS 7671 are likely
                        to satisfy the relevant parts o f statutory regulations     such as the Electricity at Work
                        Regulations 1989 (EAWR). However, this cannot be guaranteed. It is stressed that
                        it is essential to establish which statutory and other regulations apply and to install
                        accordingly. For example, a n installation in premises subject t o licensing may have
                        requirements        different f r o m or additional to those of BS 7671, and these will take
                        precedence.




8   Guidance Note 3: Inspection & Testing
    © The Institution of Engineering and Technology
BS 7671        applies to the design, erection   a n d verification   of electrical installations,
including     additions   and alterations to existing installations and to the inspection,
testing and reporting       of existing installations. Existing installations that have been
installed in accordance with earlier editions of the Regulations may not comply with
the current edition in every respect, but this does n o t necessarily mean that they
are unsafe for continued       use or that they require upgrading. The person or persons
carrying out the inspection and testing of such an installation must decide whether
the installation is safe and suitable for continued use. Inspection and testing can only
be conducted according to the requirements o f the current version of BS 7671. The
inspector must determine whether any shortcomings are classified as safety issues or
recommendations for improvement.


Other related electrical installations, such as emergency             lighting, fire alarms and
information     and communication     technology (ICT) systems, have their own installation
requirement      standards such as BS 5266, BS 5839 and BS 6701 respectively. These
may have installation, inspection, testing and certification requirements over and above
those required i n BS 7671. It is the responsibility of the duty holder to maintain all
their installations appropriately, and the extent of the inspection and testing, and the
standards to which it is conducted, should b e agreed before any work is undertaken.


The inspector is reminded that for a periodic inspection and test of a n existing
installation, their duty is to assess the suitability of the existing installation for continued
use, subject to any agreed limitations        and exclusions. They must therefore                       make
sufficient inspection and tests to enable them to make that assessment. In addition, it
is the duty of the building or site dutyholder to maintain their installation so that it is
safe and to undertake such maintenance as is necessary to achieve this.

Users of this Guidance Note should assure themselves that they have complied                              with
any relevant legislation, including, where applicable, legislation that post-dates the
publication.

Introduction


         This Guidance Note is concerned primarily with Part 6 of BS 7671 (Inspection                       and
         testing) along with Appendix 6 (Model forms for certification and reporting).


         Neither BS 7671 nor the Guidance Notes are design guides. It is essential to prepare
         a full design and specification prior to commencement              or alteration of an electrical
         installation.


 514.9   The design and specification should set out the requirements              and provide sufficient

requirements

  1.1      Safety
  Before any work can begin, a work programme should b e agreed with the client and a
  health a n d safety plan, including risk assessments and method statements, agreed and
  put in place. It m a y be that work has to be carried out when the premises is operating
  and staff are present, and they must not b e exposed to any safety risks. Work areas
  should b e fenced off w i t h temporary      barriers a n d electrical equipment             should not
  be left unattended      when open. There should be adequate workspace, access and
  lighting appropriate to t h e work being carried out, and during electrical testing it is often
  necessary to provide temporary task lighting as parts, or all, of the installation m a y
  be isolated. Escape routes must be kept open at all times or temporary                      alternatives
  arranged. Where supplies have to b e isolated, it is necessary that this is planned i n
  advance with the premises management. Health and safety guidance (HSG) Electricity
  a t work: Safe working practices (HSC85) recommends             managers establish a system
  of rules and procedures wherever electrical work is to b e carried out, or ensure that
  contractors brought in to d o electrical work have appropriate rules and procedures.


  Initial verification, and some maintenance      activities, o f fixed electrical installations fall
  within the scope of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (CDM).
  For private domestic clients, the contractor, or, if there is m o r e than one, the principal
  contractor, undertakes the client's duties.


  Electrical inspection    a n d testing inherently   involves some degree of hazard. It is
  therefore the inspector's d u t y to provide for their o w n safety, and that of others, in
  the performance of the test procedures. The testing safety procedures detailed in the
  Health and Safety Executive Guidance Note Electrical test equipment                   for use on low
  voltage electrical systems (CS38) should be observed. Where testing does not require
  the equipment    or part of an installation to be live, it should be made dead and safely
  isolated. Guidance on live and dead working can b e found i n the HSE publication The
  Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. Guidance on Regulations (HSR25). Guidance
  o n safe isolation procedures can be found i n Best Practice Guide No.2. Guidance o n
  the management       of electrical safety and safe isolation procedures for low voltage
  installations, published by Electrical Safety First.

                                  When using test instruments,                    safety can b e achieved by precautions such as:


                                  (a) understanding                     the equipment     to b e used, its rating and the characteristics of
                                          the installation upon which it is proposed to use the equipment.
                                  (b) checking                   that   the instruments to           be     used conform to the           appropriate
                                          British Standard safety specifications. These are BS EN 61010 series Safety
                                          requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory
                                          use and BS 5458:1977 (IEC 141:1973) Specification for safety requirements for
                                          indicating and recording electrical measuring                         instruments   and their accessories.
                                          BS 5 4 5 8 has n o w been                     withdrawn,        but   is the standard     to   which   older
                                          instruments              should have been manufactured.
                                  (c) checking any test equipment before use to see that it is complete and not damaged.
                                  (d) checking that test leads, including any probes or clips used, are i n good order,
                                          are clean and have no cracked or broken insulation. Where appropriate, the
                                          guidance given i n GS38 should b e observed for test leads. This recommends
                                          the use of adequately insulated test equipment, probes, connectors, a n d test
                                          leads, suitable for the insulation overvoltage category in which tests are being
                                          conducted (see Table 1.1). Suitable high breaking capacity (HBC) fuses o r other
                                          means of limiting current, should be provided i n test leads o r test equipment.
                                          Such measures help reduce the risks associated w i t h both accidental contact,

     © The Institution of Engineering a n d Technology
        Electric shock hazards can arise from, for example, capacitive loads, such as when
        cables become charged in the process of an insulation resistance test, or voltages o n
        t h e earthed metalwork whilst conducting a loop test or RCDtest. The test limits quoted
        in these guidelines are intended to minimize the chances of receiving anelectric shock
        during tests.


        Under some conditions, such as when working at height, particular care needs to be
        taken even with touch voltages below 5 0 V A C or 120 V DC. A spark, or contact with
        touch current at the limit of perception,     m a y cause an inspector or test equipment
        operator to be startled and jump or physically jolt away f r o m the contact, resulting in
        a fall or other serious incident. It is important to address such hazards when carrying
        out risk assessments before work begins.


        1.2      Required competence
641.6   Skilled persons carrying out the inspection      and testing of any electrical installation
651.5    must as, appropriate to their function, have a sound knowledge and experience relevant
        to the nature of the installation being inspected and tested, and of B S 7 6 7 1 and other
        relevant technical standards. (Such persons are generally referred t o in this Guidance
        Note as 'the inspector';   this may b e o n e or more persons, depending                  o n the work
        being undertaken.)


        Inspectors must also have the relevant education a n d experience to enable them to
        perceive risks and avoid the dangers that electricity can create, and be fully versed
        in the inspection and testing procedures. This can best be shown by the inspector
        holding a recognized inspection and testing qualification, along with a current level 3
        certificate in the requirements   for electrical installations BS 7671.


        Furthermore, the inspector must employ suitable test equipment during t h e inspection
        and testing process, be familiar with its operation, and have sufficient                      inspection
        experience in interpreting the results with regard to the requirements              of BS 7671.


        It is worth noting that the person responsible for inspection and testing may b e required to
        formally demonstrate competence by means of registration/certif ication under a recognized
        scheme or membership       of a recognized trade body, or, for example, as a condition of
        contract and/or as a requirement of the Local Authority Building Control (LABC).


        It is the responsibility of the inspector, for either the initial or periodic inspection and
        testing, as appropriate, to:


641.4 (a) prevent danger to any person or livestock and prevent property damage;
641.3 (b) compare the inspection and testing results with the design criteria (where
          available), with BS 7 6 7 1 and/or with previous records, as appropriate;
        (c) confirm compliance with the current edition of BS 7671, or any non-compliance
            (non-conformity with BS 7671) that may give rise to danger;
        (d) take a view on related issues that might constitute or give rise to danger of
            the installation itself, or its interface with the premises, such as the condition                        of

                                  In the event of a dangerous situation being found, the inspector should recommend
                                  the immediate isolation of the defective item of equipment.              The person ordering t h e
                                  work should b e informed, in writing, of this recommendation              without delay.

                  644.1           Following the initial verification of a new installation, or changes to an existing installation,
                  653.1           an Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC), together with a Schedule(s) of Inspections
                                  and a Schedule(s)of Test Results, is required to b e given to the person ordering the
                                  installation work.


                                  Likewise, following           the periodic inspection a n d testing of an existing installation,
                                  a n Electrical Installation Condition         Report (EICR), together      w i t h Condition    Report
                                 Inspection Schedule, Schedule(s)of Circuit Details and Schedule(s) of Test Results, is
                                 required to b e given to the person ordering the inspection.


                                  Sometimes the person ordering the work is not the user of the installation. I n such
                                  cases, it is necessary for the user (for example, the employer or householder)                 t o have
                                 a copy of the certificate (together with the records o f inspections and test results).
                                 It is recommended that those providing documentation to the person ordering the
                                 work also recommend               that a copy of the forms b e passed to the user, including any
                                 purchaser o f a domestic property. For rented accommodation,                  this m a y b e required
                                 by legislation (see Section 1.3.2).


                                 Copies of any certificates o r reports along with their associated schedules should b e
                                 kept in the operational a n d maintenance (O&M) documentation                 for t h e premises.


                                 1.3.2            Rented domestic and residential accommodation
                                 In England and Wales, Sub-Section (l)(b)              of Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant
                                 Act 1985 (Repairing obligations in short leases) implies that a landlord "shall keep in
                                 repair and proper working order the installations in the dwelling-house for the supply
                                 of water, gas and electricity".

                                 Asimilar requirement can b e found in Section 13 of Chapter 4 of the Housing (Scotland)
                                 Act 2014, which states that the electrical installation must b e in a reasonable state
                                 of repair, in order to comply with the Act. The legislation goes on to state that the
                                 installation must b e maintained.


                                 The above Acts d o not directly specify periodic inspection a n d testing of a n electrical
                                 installation. Periodic inspection a n d testing is a means of demonstrating compliance
                                 with the Acts. The Scottish Government                has published    guidance o n meeting          the

                                 The Electrical Safety Standards i n the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations
                                 2 0 2 0 apply t o all n e w tenancies i n private rented properties        in England f r o m 1 July
                                 2020, a n d all existing tenancies f r o m 1 April 2021. This legislation requires an EICRto

         conducted within 5 years of an EIC for the entire installation being issued). Inspection
         and testing of rented properties        is also required in Scotland. Whilst over a n d above
         t h e requirements in legislation, landlords should b e aware that damage may occur to
         parts o f the electrical installation, and, where practicable, can consider an electrical
         inspection o n change of tenancy.


         Any repairs m u s t b e carried out by an electrically skilled person or an electrically
         competent person under their supervision. The landlord is responsible for confirming
         the competency           of any contractors carrying out such work. Advice for landlords on
         the legislation, including       guidance   o n n o w to find a competent person t conduct

         1.3.3      The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015
         The client a n d contractors have duties for health, safety a n d welfare according to t h e
         CDM Regulations. F o r a private domestic client, the contractor (or, if more than o n e
         contractor, the principal contractor) assumes the client's duties.


         1.4        Additions and alterations
          Every addition or alteration to an existing installation must comply with the current
 644.1    edition of B S 7671 and must not impair the safety of the existing installation. The
 641.3    relevant inspection and testing requirements of Chapter 64 also apply to additions and
         alterations and, in particular, to the replacement o f a distribution board or consumer
         unit. In order to verify that an addition o r alteration to an electrical installation complies
         with BS 7671, the relevant parts of the existing installation must b e inspected                  and
         tested to confirm the safety of the addition or alteration, including, for example, the:


         (a)   circuit ratings;
         (b)   circuit conductor sizes;
         (c)   means of earthing;
         (d)   protective conductor continuity; and
         (e)   earth fault loop impedance (EFLI).


644.1 .2 While there is no obligation to inspect and test any part of the existing installation that
         does not affect and is not affected by the addition o r alteration, any defects with the
         existing installation that are observed during the course of the works, that may give
         rise to danger, b u t d o n o t affect the safety of the addition or alteration, are required to
         be noted in the ’Comments on existing installation’ section of an EIC (single-signature
         or multiple-signature)       or o n Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificates (MElWCs).
         If there is insufficient space to complete this information,     a separate document           could
         b e used and referred to in the certificate.

                                     Part 2 of BS 7671.


                                     "Departure. Deliberate decision not to comply fully w i t h the requirement of BS 7671,
                                     for which the designer must declare that the resultant degree o f safety is not less than
                                     that achievable by full compliance."

                                     "Non-compliance. A non-conformity                         that may give rise to danger."


                                     Note:             A non-conformity is a failure to meet a requirement of a standard.



                                     1.6             Record-keeping
                     132.13 It is a requirement that the appropriate documentation called for in Regulation 514.9,
                      514.9 Part 6 and (where applicable) Part 7 o f BS 7671 is provided for every electrical installation.

                                     For non-domestic                   installations,    Regulation   12 o f the Construction         (Design   and
                                     Management)                    Regulations 2015 (CDM) requires a record known as 'the health and
                                     safety file' to b e prepared, reviewed, updated and revised from t i m e to time to take
                                     account of the work and any changes that have occurred. This file should contain any
                                     information relating to the project that is likely to b e needed during any subsequent
                                     construction work to provide for the health and safety of persons. The CDM Regulations
                                     require that the health a n d safety file is passed o n t o the client o n completion                   of the
                                     construction work to assist with ongoing management                        of the building.


                                    The CDM Regulations also require that once the construction work has been completed,
                                    the health and safety file remains available for inspection by any person who might need
                                     it to comply with any relevant legal requirements. It also requires that the file is revised
                                     and updated as often as may b e appropriate to incorporate any relevant new information.


                                     EICs, MElWCs and EICRs (as appropriate) would constitute                           relevant information      in
                                     relation to this requirement.


                                     For domestic installations, NHBC (National House-Building           Council) guidance
                                     recommends that all instructions for services are passed to t h e building owner.


                                    In both domestic and non-domestic                        cases, there may also be insurance requirements
                                    that imply or specify records.

                    2.1      Purpose of initial verification
                    Verification is defined in BS 7671 as: "All measures by means of which compliance
                    of the electrical installation with the relevant requirements       of BS 7671 are checked,
                    comprising inspection, testing and certification."


                    Initial verification is carried out on a new installation before it is put into service. The
           642.2    purpose is to confirm by way of inspection and testing, during construction and on

                    completion, that the installation complies with the design and construction                 aspects of
                    BS 7671, in so far as is reasonably practicable.


Appx 6, Intro (v)   It is important to recognize the responsibilities o f the signatories for the design,
                    construction and verification. While the inspector is responsible for verifying aspects of
                    b o t h design a n d construction, they cannot, and are not m e a n t to, absolve responsibility
                    for their work elements from the designer and installer nor fix any problems they may find.


                    Example


                    Consider o n e aspect of the design: the inspector should check that the cable sizes, as
                    specified, have been correctly selected and installed. In order to do this, the design
                    criteria is required to be obtained, for example, a cable o r circuit schedule, and will
                    then carryout a visual inspection of the installed cable sizes for comparison. The m o s t
                    logical position to d o so will be at the distribution board housing the cables' protective
                    devices. It would b e unreasonable for the inspector to carry out design cable sizing
                    checks, as this is the responsibility of the designer.


                    At this point, it would also be unreasonable for the inspector to check that each cable
                    size at the distribution point is maintained throughout        the cable's length (this is the
                    responsibility of the installer or constructor).


                    This example illustrates the principle a n d the responsibilities        of the designer and
                    constructor of the installation. The inspector carries out checks, but only to confirm
                    the work of others.


             42.3   The inspector must have adequate information o n the design details to check and
                    inspect against. BS 7671 provides a format list in Regulation 642.3 of items to be
                    checked, although this list is not exhaustive. These items are as follows:


                    (a) installed   electrical   equipment   is of the correct     t y p e and complies w i t h an
                        applicable British or Harmonized       Standard, or a foreign national standard based
                        o n an International Electrotechnical Commission        (IEC) Standard;

                          (b) the fixed installation     is correctly selected   and erected,    taking into    account
                               manufacturers’ instructions;
                          (c) the fixed installation is n o t visibly damaged or otherwise defective           so as to
                               impair safety; and
                          (d) the installation is ready a n d safe to be used.


           Sect 642      Inspections
                         Inspections are an important        element of inspection a n d testing and are described in
                         Section 2.5 o f this Guidance Note.


           Sect 643 Tests
                         The tests are described in Section 2.6 of this Guidance Note.


               644.1     Results
                         The results of inspection and tests are to be recorded as appropriate. The HSE's
                         publication HSR25 recommends that records of all maintenance, including test results,
                         b e kept throughout the working life o f an installation (see guidance on the Electricity
                         at Work Regulations 1989 (EAWR), Regulation 4(2)). This can enable the condition of
                         equipment and the effectiveness of maintenance t o be monitored.


               643.1 R e l e v a n t c r i t e r i a
                         The relevant criteria are, for the most part, the requirements         of the Regulations for
                         the particular inspection or test. Most criteria are given i n Sections 2 and 3 of this
                         Guidance Note.


                         There will b e some instances where the designer has specified requirements               that
                         are particular to the installation concerned.      For example, the intended impedances
                         may be different from those in BS7671. I n this case, the inspector should either ask
                         for the design criteria or forward the test results to the designer for verification with
                         the intended        design. In the absence of such data, t h e inspector should apply the
                         requirements set o u t in BS 7671 .


                         Verification
                         The responsibility for comparing inspection a n d test results w i t h relevant criteria, as
                         required by Regulation 641.3, lies with the party responsible for inspecting and testing
                         t h e installation. This party, which may be the person carrying out the inspection a n d
                         testing, should sign the ’Inspection and testing’ section of the Electrical Installation
                         Certificate    (EIC) or the ’Declaration’ section of t h e Minor Electrical Installation Works
                         Certificate (MEIWC). If the person carrying o u t the inspection and testing is also
                         responsible for the ’Design’ and 'Construction' of the installation, the design and
                         construction sections of the EIC should be completed         by the same person.



                         2.2         Certificates
             Appx 6 Appendix 6 of B S 7671 contains model forms for the initial certification of a new
                    installation or for a n addition or alteration to a n existing installation, as follows:


                         (a) the multiple-signature      EIC; o r
                         (b) the MEIWC.

          2.5       Initial   inspection

          2.5.1     General   procedure
          Inspection and, where required, testing should b e carried out and it is recommended
          that a record of the results should b e retained throughout the different stages of erection
          to enable the issue of relevant certification on completion of the verification process.


          It should b e noted that Regulation 641.1 requires inspection and testing to b e carried out
          during the erection stage of the installation. This is to allow the review and inspection
          of work that may later b e covered and inaccessible; however, t h e inspector will require
          necessary design information from the designer before any such inspections during
          construction or installation.


          A model Schedule of Inspections is shown in Section 5 of this Guidance Note.


          2.5.2     Comments      on individual      items to be inspected

  642.3 BS7671 provides a list of items considered as a minimum to be inspected, but t h e list
        is not exhaustive. The inspector, where necessary, will inspect and compare the items
        against data provided by the designer and installer and identify any non-compliances
          or departures. However, it is not for the inspector to decide what installation items are
          required o r necessary, or to identify any repairs or modifications.   The list is as follows:

          a
Sect526           Connection of conductors
          Every connection between          conductors and equipment/other        conductors        should
          provide durable electrical continuity and adequate mechanical strength.


          It is impractical for an inspector t o physically inspect all connections but they should
          inspect a representative sample of connection types, especially larger connections,
          such as o n switchgear and busbars. When checking connections, t h e correct torque
          setting for screw or bolted terminals should b e used. (It is noted that in some cases,
          such as high current busbar connections,     specialist resistance tests may b e required
          that are outside the scope of BS7671.)


          There are four stranding classes of conductor described in B S E N 6 0 2 2 8 :


          (a) Class 1, solid, conductors.    These consist of only a single strand of conductor
              forming the entire csa.
          (b) Class 2, stranded, conductors.      These consist of at least 6 strands, although
              some applications in Part 7 of BS 7 6 7 1 specify a m i n i m u m of 7 strands are
              used for stranding class 2 conductors.
          (c) Class 5, finely stranded (flexible) conductors, These are m o r e finely stranded
              than Class 2 stranded conductors, and are typically found in appliance cables,
              or flexible installation cables.
          (d) Class 6, extra-finely stranded (extra-flexible) conductors, being m o r e finely
              stranded again.

                                 b          Identification of cables and conductors
                                 It should b e checked that each core or bare conductor is identified as necessary. The
                                 single colour green must not b e used for the identification                    of live conductors in power
                                 circuits, protective conductors, or functional earthing and bonding conductors.


                                 The bi-colour                  combination    green-and-yellow      is only to b e used for protective
                                 conductors. Other than protective earth and neutral (PEN) conductors, conductors that
                                 are identified with green-and-yellow throughout their length, either as a single-core
                                 cable, or as a core in a multicore cable, must not b e overmarked with another colour
                                 or with alphanumeric symbols at terminations, except for the purposes of identifying
                                 which circuit t h e cpc serves.


                                 Again, it is impractical for a n inspector to physically inspect all identifications,                 but they
                                 should inspect a representative sample of types, especially o n larger conductors, such
                                 as to switchgear.

              Cables routed in buildings must b e fixed such that they cannot c o m e away from
              their supports during fires and collapse to block escape routes or entangle firefighters
              searching the building in smoke-filled conditions.       Such entanglements           have led to
              fatalities in t h e past, which could have been avoided with s o m e forethought.             Not all
              escape routes in a building are defined and signed: in open-plan            office areas, there
              can b e several possible routes away f r o m a desk or meeting r o o m across an o p e n
              office area to an escape stair (see BS 9999) and all such routes should b e kept clear
              f r o m possible entanglement. An escape route is defined i n the Regulations as a "path
              to follow for access t o a safe area in the event of an emergency". T h e requirement for
              surface-run wiring systems n o t t o b e subject to premature collapse in the event of a
              fire applies to all areas, and not just designated escape routes.


              It is not difficult to look at a proposed    installation and consider the possibilities              of
              cables coming away from their fixings: have only plastic ties been used, is cable tray
              metal or plastic, is t h e tray upside d o w n and so on? If t h e cable supports are metal and
              t h e cables are laid in or cleated t o t h e m with metal fixings, then the cable cannot go
              anywhere. Even if a cable is fixed with plastic ties or clips and could drop, it may only
              require an occasional metal or fire-resistant fixing to restrain it.


              I n larger industrial or commercial installations, cable ladder or tray and other services
              may b e suspended      together   f r o m concrete structural elements      by steel wires or
              'drop rods' screwed into the concrete. The inspector          cannot physically assess the
              suitability or the loading of such fixings, but may look at the design data provided to
              see that what is installed is as the design.


              Where cables run around or d o w n walls - for example, t o a socket-outlet - and
              are contained in small-section plastic trunking, the cables should b e fixed inside the
              trunking if it would b e possible for t h e trunking to deform in heat and the lid come off,
              thus releasing the cables.


              The inspector m u s t also assess any fire protection repairs and fire-stopping where
Appendix 13   cables have been installed through a fire-rated building structural element or wall. The
              electrical installation designer should provide information in relation to fire safety with
              regard to cable routes. Regulation 527.2.1 requires that openings remaining after t h e
              passage of wiring systems are sealed according to the degree of fire-resistance
              prescribed for the respective element of the building construction before penetration.
              The seal is required to:


              (a) resist the products      of combustion     to t h e same extent    as the elements               of
                  building construction which have been penetrated;
              (b) provide the same degree of protection f r o m water penetration            as that required
                  for the building construction element in which it has been installed;
              (c) b e compatible with the material of the wiring system that it is in contact with;
              (d) permit thermal movement of t h e wiring system without reducing t h e sealing
                  quality; and
              (e) have adequate mechanical stability to withstand         t h e stresses which may arise
                  through damage to the support of the wiring system due to fire.


    527.2.3   Where wiring system containment        (conduit, trunking, and busbar trunking systems)
Appendix 13   passes through a building element that has specific fire resisting properties and has an
              internal cross-sectional area greater than 710 m m 2 for example, a round hole of around
              3 0 m m diameter, it must b e internally sealed in accordance with Regulation 527.2.3.

   Sect 523 The cross-sectional area (csa) of conductors should be assessed against the overcurrent
   Sect 524 protective arrangement and the requirements for limitation of voltage drop, based
   Sect 525 upon information provided by the installation designer (where available), such as a
            cable schedule or schematic diagram.

              Reference should be made, as appropriate, to Appendix 4 of BS7671.


   132.14.1       e
                      Verification of polarity: single-pole device in a TN or TT system
    530.3.2    must be checked that single-pole devices for protection or switching are installed in
              line conductors only, and that Edison screw (ES) lampholders are correctly connected.

              f       Accessories and equipment
              Correct connection (suitability, polarity, environmental factors, etc.) must be checked.


    553.1.3   Table 55.1 of BS 7671 sets out the three different types of plug and socket-outlet
              recognized, their ratings and their associated British Standards.


    553.2.2   Particular attention should be made to the correct connection of cable couplers so that
              pins of connectors (which would be accessible when the couplers are disconnected)
              are connected to the load or downstream side of the connection. Couplers for cables
              in which current may flow in either directions, such as some circuits in prosumer’s
              electrical installations (PEIs), appropriate couplers having live parts protected to at least
              IP2X on both parts of the coupler when disconnected should be used.


559.5.1.204   Bayonet lampholders B15 and B22 should comply with BS EN 61184 and have a
559.5.1.205   temperature rating T2, as described in that standard. With the exception of E14 and
              E27 lampholders complying with BS EN 60238, ES lampholders used in TN and
              TT systems should have the line of the supply connected to their centre contact, and
              neutral connected to the outer contact. Lighting circuits incorporating B15, B22, E14,
              E27 or E40 lampholders are only to b e used in a lighting circuit rated up to 16 A.


   Sect 527   g       Selection and erection to minimize the spread of fire
              Fire barriers, suitable seals and/or protection againstthermal effects should be provided,
              if necessary, to meet the requirements of BS7671. These are good examples of items
              which can and should be inspected during the erection stage.

              Each sealing arrangement built around services penetrations through a fire-rated
              building element should be labelled by the specialist installer to state its fire rating and
              inspected to verify that it conforms to the manufacturer's erection instructions and
              required rating. It is essential, therefore, that inspection should be carried out at the
              appropriate stage of the work, and that this is recorded at the time for incorporation in
              the inspection and test documents.

              A wiring system such as conduit, trunking or ducting that penetrates a building element
              that has a specified fire rating is to be sealed both internally and externally to the
              degree of fire resistance of the external element. Fire barrier requirements are detailed
              in Regulations 527.2.2 and 527.2.3.

              Products classified as 'non-flame propagating' in accordance with BS EN 61386-1 or
              BS EN 50085 are liable to catch fire as a result of an applied flame, but in which the
              flame does not propagate, and which extinguish themselves within a limited time after
              the flame is removed. The test to classify products as 'non-flame propagating' is a
              self-extinguishing test, not a fire resistance test. The product cannot be assumed to

                                  The type of system earthing arrangement m u s t b e stated by t h e designer, for example:


                                  (a)      TN-C-S;
                                  (b)      TN-S; or
                                  (c)      TT (earth electrode(s) used as the means of earthing for t h e installation).


                                  The earthing arrangement should b e confirmed by the DNO, and not assumed by
                                  visual inspection.


           411.5 (TN)             For installations that receive a low voltage (LV) supply f r o m the public distribution
            411.5 (TT) network, the designer should also ascertain whether protective multiple earthing
                       (PME) conditions apply, as this affects the application of certain requirements of
                                  BS 7671, such as t h e sizing of main protective bonding conductors, and earthing for
                                  some of the special locations in Part 7 (for example, use of a PME earthing arrangement
                                  is precluded for some special locations, such as caravan parks and marinas). Guidance
                                  is available from the local DNO and in Energy Networks Association publication G12/4
                                 Requirements                   for the Application   of Protective Multiple    Earthing   to Low Voltage
                                 Networks. PME conditions will normally apply in public LV supplies:


                                  (a) with a TN-C-S earthing arrangement; and
                                  (b) with a PNB earthing arrangement, where the neutral of supply is earthed                            at
                                         some distance downstream of the LV transformer, rather than at the transformer
                                         itself. PNB is used by DNOs where it is necessary t o separate HV and LV
                                         earthing systems.


                                 The EFLImust b e appropriate for the protective device, i.e. RCD or overcurrent device,
                                 and within the values given in the relevant tables in Chapter 41 of BS 7671.


                                 Double or reinforced insulation


                 412.1           For double insulation, basic protection is provided                     by basic insulation,    and fault
                                 protection is provided by supplementary insulation.


                                 For reinforced insulation, both basic protection                 a n d fault protection   are provided by
                                 a single application of reinforced insulation between live parts and accessible parts.


                                 Where double or reinforced insulation is to b e employed a s t h e sole protective measure,
                                 it is important to confirm that t h e installation or circuit so protected will remain under
                                 effective supervision so as to prevent any unauthorized                       change(s) being m a d e that
                                 could impair the effectiveness of t h e measure.


                                 Electrical separation for the supply of one item of current-using equipment


                 413.1.1 Electrical separation is a protective measure where basic protection is provided by
                         basic insulation of live parts and/or by barriers and enclosures, in accordance with
                                 Section 416, and fault protection is provided by simple separation o f t h e separated
                                 circuit f r o m other circuits and f r o m Earth.

            (iii)        Protective measures for use only where access is controlled
                         or supervised by skilled persons

Obstacles

   41       Protection by obstacles provides basic protection only, n o t fault protection. It protects
            against unintentional     contact with live parts.


            Where this measure is used, the area must b e accessible only to skilled persons or to
            instructed persons under their supervision.


            The measure is not to b e used in some installations and locations of increased shock
            risk. See Part 7 of BS7671.


            Placing out of reach


   417      Placing out of reach also provides basic protection only. The distances referred to in
            Regulations 417.3.1 and 417.3.2 should b e increased where long or bulky conducting
            objects are likely to b e handled in t h e vicinity, taking account of the dimensions                          of
            those objects.


 410.3.5    Bare live parts are only permitted in areas where access is controlled or supervised
            by skilled persons. The dimensions of passageways should be checked against the
            information given in Appendix 3 of t h e HSE's guidance o n HSR25 (see Section 729).


Sect 729    Section 7 2 9 (Operating and maintenance gangways) covers situations where open
            switchgear or busbars are permitted and where access is restricted to skilled or
            instructed persons. Inspection for verification in areas covered by Section 7 2 9 requires
            careful checking, including the measurement of separation distances, for example,
            those associated with 'arm's reach', as per Figure 417 of BS 7671; these must b e
            confirmed with the installation isolated. However, it must be noted that the EAWRtake
            precedence in all cases and their requirements       for accessible live conductors must b e
            followed in all cases.

                                 (iv)             Protective measures for use only where the installation is
                                                  controlled or under the supervision of skilled or
                                                  instructed persons
                                 Non-conducting                 location

                                 Where this protective measure is employed, such as in a n electronic equipment test
                                 area, it must be verified (amongst other things) that all installed electrical equipment
                                 m e e t s the requirements of Section 416 with regard to provisions for basic protection.

               418J.2            Further, t h e exposed-conductive-parts of t h e installation should b e so arranged that
                                 it is not possible for persons to make simultaneous contact with either two exposed-
                                 conductive-parts,               or an exposed-conductive-part and any extraneous-conductive-part
                                 under normal operating conditions, if these parts are liable to b e at different potentials
                                 as a result of failure of the basic insulation of a live part.


                                 The inspector should confirm the achievement of this and check that within t h e
                                 location there are n o protective conductors (see also the specific test for this m e t h o d
                                 in Section 2.6.12 of this Guidance Note).

                  418.2          Earth-free local equipotential             bonding

                                 The use of this protective measure is intended to prevent the appearance of a
                                 dangerous touch voltage under fault conditions. In some cases, this protective measure
                                 is combined with the protective measure of electrical separation.


                                 Where protection by earth-free local equipotential bonding is employed, it must b e
                                 verified (amongst other things) that all installed electrical equipment should meet t h e
                                 requirements               of Section 416 with regard to provisions for basic protection.


                             ’ All simultaneously accessible exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-
                               parts should b e interconnected by local protective bonding conductors.

               418.2.3           Measures m u s t b e taken to ensure that the local protective bonding conductors are not
                                 connected to Earth either directly or unintentionally via the exposed- and extraneous-
                                 conductive-parts               to which they are connected.


                                 A warning notice complying with Regulation 514.13.2 m u s t b e fixed in a prominent
                                 position adjacent to every point of access to the location concerned.

                                The inspection, supplemented                 with tests, should verify that n o item is earthed within
                                the area and that n o earthed services or conductors enter or traverse the area, including
                                t h e floor and ceiling. Inspection should confirm whether or n o t this has b e e n achieved.

                                Electrical separation for the supply to more than o n e item of current-using equipment

                  418.3              it is intended             to supply more than one item of current-using equipment using
            Sect 413            electrical separation, it will b e necessary to m e e t the requirements of Regulation 418.3.
                                This is in addition to meeting the requirements of Section 413, some of which are
                                referred to earlier in this section of this Guidance Note in relation to the use of electrical
                                 separation for the supply of one item of current-using equipment.

              418.3.3           The separated circuit should b e protected f r o m damage and insulation failure.

                                Any exposed-conductive-parts of t h e separated circuit should b e connected together by
                                insulated, non-earthed protective bonding conductors, which should n o t b e connected
                                to the protective conductor or exposed-conductive-parts                  of any other circuit or to any
                                extraneous-conductive-parts.

418.    Socket-outlets should have a protective conductor contact, which is connected to the
        protective bonding system described above.


        All flexible cables should contain a protective conductor for use as a protective bonding
        conductor, except where such a cable supplies only items of equipment                   having double
        or reinforced insulation.


        If two faults affecting two exposed-conductive-parts occur, and where conductors
        of different polarity feed these, a protective device should disconnect the supply in
        accordance with t h e disconnection    time given in Table 41 .1 .


418/    The product of t h e nominal voltage (volts) a n d length (metres) of the wiring system
        should not exceed 100,000 Vm and the length of the wiring system (metres) should
        n o t exceed 5 0 0 m.


        (v)      Additional protection

        Additional protection by one o r more RCDs


415.1.1 It should b e confirmed that an RCD selected to provide additional protection has a
        rated residual operating current     not exceeding 3 0 m A and complies with the
        relevant standards.


        Generally, all socket-outlets   up to and including 3 2 A rating should b e provided with
        additional protection by a 3 0 m A RCD; however BS 7671 allows this to b e omitted for
        some socket-outlets in certain locations such as non-domestic installations where a
        written risk assessment shows that such additional protection is not required. It is not
        for the inspector to consider or approve the risk assessment, but the inspector should
        see the assessment to prove that it exists, so that the requirement               of the regulation
        is fulfilled. The assessment should also b e attached to the Electrical Installation or
        MEIWC, for future reference.


415J.2 It should also b e confirmed that appropriate protective measures in accordance with
       Sections 411 to 414 are in place, as an RCD m u s t not b e used as the sole means of
        protection against electric shock.


        Additional protection by supplementary      protective equipotential      bonding


415.2.1 Where supplementary bonding is provided, it should encompass all simultaneously
        accessible exposed-conductive-parts of fixed equipment, extraneous-conductive-parts
        and the protective conductors of all equipment in the location where this protective
        measure is being applied.


415.2.2 The effectiveness of supplementary equipotential bonding, as provided, may b e verified
        where the resistance between simultaneously accessible exposed-conductive-parts and
        extraneous-conductive-parts fulfils whichever of the following conditions is applicable:


        (a)      for AC systems, R < 5 0 V/I a ; and

        Note:    In medical locations of Group 1 and Group 2, and in fuel filling stations installed in
                 accordance with APEAGuidance for Design, Construction, Modification, Maintenance
                 and Decommissioning of Filling Stations, the voltage is reduced from 50 V to 25 V.

                         (b)          for DC systems, R < 120 V/I a

                         where la is the operating current of the protective device in amps (for overcurrent
                         devices, this is the 5 s operating current, and for RCDs, | n).


              5313       RCDs should be selected in accordance with Regulation 531.3. Selection of RCDs
                         should take into account the residual fault current operating characteristics of loads
                         with respect to DC components.

                         Type AC RCDs shall only be used for fixed equipment, where it is known that the

Sect 515   '    Prevention of m u t u a l detrimental influence
           Regulations 132.11 and 515.1 require electrical equipment               to b e so selected and
           erected that there will b e no harmful influence (such as electromagnetic                interference
           (EMI) or heat) between t h e electrical installation and other electrical and non-electrical
           installations. The inspector is advised to give careful thought to this while carrying o u t
           t h e inspection.


 132.5.1 This, however, does not include the detrimental influence of other systems onto
         t h e electrical installation, such as water leaks or splashing, which are covered by the
         requirements of Regulation 132.5.1.

                             The inspector should carry o u t an isolation review to check that effective isolation
                             can b e achieved, b u t it is n o t the inspector's responsibility t o resolve any apparent
                             shortcomings           or problems with the isolation and switching design. The review could
                             include, where appropriate, locking-off and inspection or testing to verify that the circuit
                             is dead and n o other source of supply is present. The designer should also identify
                             where it may b e necessary to isolate the neutral conductor.


                             Note (5) to Table 537.4 i n B S 7 6 7 1 points out that circuit-breakers and RCDsare n o t

                             by the device manufacturer for this duty. The note gives further guidance relating to
                             this a n d the inspector is at liberty to make a comment o n this use if it is inappropriate.


        543.3.3.101 BS 7671 does not allow a switching or isolating device to b e placed in the earth
                             or protective conductor, other than a plug and socket-outlet, except for the special
                             conditions outlined in Regulations 543.3.3.101.


                             k       Presence of undervoltage protective devices
                             Suitable precautions should b e in place where a reduction in voltage, or loss and
                             subsequent restoration of voltage, could cause danger. Normally, such a requirement
                             concerns only motor circuits. If precautions are required, they will have been specified
                             by the designer; however, the devices used must b e confirmed as matching the
                             equipment specification and the relevant regulations in Section 445.


            Chap 4: |                Protective a n d monitoring devices
                             Some protective                 devices have user or on-site configurable     settings. The inspector
                            needs to confirm that the installer has correctly set up such protective devices.


               421.1.7 Arc fault detection devices (AFDDs) are designed to provide protection by monitoring
                            the change of current f l o w in a final circuit due to a possible cable conductor fault
                            that could cause an arc and possible fire. BS 7671 requires AFDDs t o b e provided for
                            single-phase AC circuits supplying socket-outlets with a rated current not exceeding
                            3 2 A in electrical installations for:


                            (a) Higher Risk Residential Buildings (HRRBs);

                            Note:          HRRBs are assumed to b e residential buildings over 18 m i n height or in excess
                                           of six storeys, whichever is met first. It is anticipated that i n m a n y areas higher risk
                                           residential buildings will b e defined in legislation which can b e subject to change over
                                           time, as well as in risk management procedures adopted by fire a n d rescue services.
                                           Current legislation should be applied.

                            (b) Houses in Multiple Occupation                 (HMOs);
                            (c) Purpose-built student accommodation; and
                            (d) Care homes.


                            For other installations, BS 7 6 7 1 recommends their use for AC final circuits supplying
                            socket-outlets not exceeding 3 2 A, but it is for the designer to decide on their use in
                            other installations, a n d the inspector cannot comment if they are not installed.

         Some makes of AFDDs have a manual test button (like an RCD) a n d this should b e
         pressed at commissioning and user advised to press at six monthly intervals to prove
         operation. Other AFDDs have an automatic test facility which will trip t h e device in t h e
         event of a malfunction,     this will b e indicated on the device.


Sect 443 The guidance for the application           of surge protective     devices (SPDs) has been
         revised in BS 7671:2018+A2:2022,           providing for protection   against switching surges
         and surges of atmospheric          origin (lightning   strikes). Except for simple installations
         for which t h e requirements       of Sections 443 and 5 3 4 of BS 7 6 7 1 can b e followed,
         surge protection, and where applicable lightning protection systems, will usually b e
         designed and installed, by specialist suppliers i n accordance with the relevant parts of
         BS EN 6 2 3 0 5 . In these cases, the inspector can only review what is installed against
         the scheme documentation provided by the specialist suppliers, and review their test
         and commissioning documentation.

Sect     m      Labelling of protective devices, switches and terminals
 514 8 J Each protective device must b e arranged and identified           so that the circuit protected
 514.9.1 can b e easily identified; a diagram or chart indicating t h e function of each circuit and
         size of conductors is required. The inspector will need this key document in order to
         carry out much of their inspection and testing.


         n      Selection of equipment and protective measures appropriate to
                external influences
         Equipment      must b e selected with regard to its suitability for the environment             at its
         specific location —ambient temperature, heat, water, foreign bodies, corrosion, impact,
         vibration, flora, fauna, radiation, building use and structure. A careful inspection is
         necessary to confirm the suitability of each item of equipment.

              514.9.1     (x )   Presence of diagrams, instructions and similar information
                          ► The presence of diagrams, charts or tables, or an equivalent f o r m of information
                                 for t h e work being inspected, should b e verified. The form of information          should
                                 b e legible and durable, a n d should indicate all of the following:

                                 (a) t h e t y p e and composition     of each circuit (including t h e points of utilization
                                     served, the number and size of conductors, a n d t h e t y p e of wiring);
                                 (b) the m e t h o d used for compliance with Regulation 410.3.2 (that is, t h e
                                     protective measures used for basic and fault protection);
                                 (c) t h e information necessary for t h e identification of each device performing
                                     t h e functions of protection, isolation and switching, and its location; and
                                 (d) any circuit o r equipment that is vulnerable to the electrical tests as required
                                     by Part 6.


                                 For a simple installation, t h e foregoing information can b e given in t h e f o r m of
                                 a schedule. An additional copy of t h e Schedule of Circuit Details provided within
                                 or adjacent to each distribution board is likely to m e e t this requirement. In
                                 domestic (household) premises or similar installations the schedule does not
                                 have to b e fixed o n o r near the distribution board or consumer unit, provided that
                                 the information is contained         along with t h e certification for initial verification,
                                 complete with Guidance for Recipients according to Appendix 6 of BS7671.


                                 A complex installation would obviously require more comprehensive                information,
                                 in the f o r m of a record or of 'as-built' drawings and O & M documents.


                                 Diagrams, charts, warning and information and instruction notices should comply
                                 with the standards specified in Regulation 514.9.2.


                         Non-standard colours
                         Over time, there have been changes in the colours for identification                  of conductors
                         in BS 7671,         and, before     1992, previous       editions   of the Wiring Regulations. In
                         BS 7671:2001(2004),           awarning notice was introduced for installations using conductor
                         identification colours to different versions of BS7671. Regulation 514.14.1 was deleted
                         in BS 7671 :2018+A2:2022 and such a w a r n i n g notice will, in future, n o t b e necessary
                         t o comply with BS 7671 .


                         There is nothing to prevent the continued use of this type of warning notice.


                         q        Erection methods
                         Chapter 5 2 contains detailed             requirements    on selection   and erection.     Fixings of
                         switchgear, cables, conduit, fittings, etc. must b e adequate for the environment               and a
                         detailed visual inspection is required during the erection stages, as well as at completion.


                         Regulation 521.10.202 requires that cables are to b e supported so they will n o t collapse
                         and come away f r o m their fixings in the event of a fire and impede the escape of
                         persons f r o m buildings. This can usually b e achieved by installing a metal cable fixing
                         at reasonable intervals.


                         2.5.3       Inspection        checklist
                         Listed below are requirements to b e checked w h e n carrying out an installation
                         inspection. The list is not exhaustive. The inspector can check against t h e design and
                         installation data provided by the designer and installer and report any non-compliances
                         noted, but cannot make any requirements.

                         Enclosures
                         General
                         (a) There is a suitable degree of protection (IP Code in BS EN 6 0 5 2 9 ) appropriate
                               to external influences w h e n installed, taking account of the manufacturer's
                               instructions (416.2, 512.2, 522, Part 7).


                         2.6         Tests associated with               initial    verification
                         The test methods described in this section are recommended to b e used as part of
                         initial and periodic verification. This does n o t rule out the use of other test methods,
                         provided they give valid results.


                         Note:       In medical locations of group 1 and 2, the measurement and recording of
                                     supplementary bonding conductor resistance values is required. Where medical
                                     IT systems are installed, measurement of capacitive leakage currents are required.
                                     Further information is available in IET Guidance Note 7 Special Locations.


                         2.6.1       Test results
                         The test results must b e recorded o n the Schedule(s) of Test Results and compared
                         with relevant criteria. For example, in order to verify disconnection times, the relevant
                         criteria would b e design EFLIvalues provided by t h e designer.


                         A model Schedule of Test Results is shown in Section 5.

           2.6.2     Electrical   Installation     Certificate     (EIC)
          Regulation 644.1 of BS 7 6 7 1 requires that u p o n completion of the verification of a
          new, modified or extended installation, an EIC based on the model given in Appendix 6
          of BS7671 is provided to the person that ordered the work. Chapter 6 4 requires that:


 644.3    (a) the EIC is accompanied     by a Schedule of Inspections, Circuit Details and Test
                Results. These schedules shall b e based o n the models given in Appendix 6 of
                BS 7671;
 644.3    (b) the Schedule of Test Results shall include test results for the work done;
 644.,:   (c) the EIC is signed or otherwise authenticated       by a skilled person responsible for
                each facet of design, construction      and inspection and test and competent to
                verify that the requirements of B S 7 6 7 1 have been met; and
644.1.    (d) any defects or omissions revealed by the inspector are required to b e made
                good by the installer, and, as necessary, inspected        and tested again, before the
                EIC is issued; it is not the responsibility      of the person or organization carrying
                out t h e inspection and testing to make good defects or omissions.


          Where the installation work does not extend to the installation             of a n e w circuit, a
          MEIWC may b e used instead of the full EIC. This simplifies the documentation for small
          works; in addition, the required installation inspection and testing and tests are limited
          to the circuit being extended or modified, as detailed in Part 4 of the certificate. See
          Section 5 for further details and guidance o n the completion         of this certificate.


          NOTE:      The model the model forms in Appendix6 of BS7671 can be amended to suit the
                     installation, provided that the minimum information required is included.


          2.6.3     Model     forms
          Typical forms for use when          carrying out inspection      and testing are included            in
          Section 5 of this Guidance Note.


 643.1    2.6.4     T h e sequence of tests
          Tests associated with initial verification should b e carried out in the following sequence,
          where relevant and practical:

                  643.2 2.6.5 Continuity of protective conductors, including main and
                              supplementary bonding
                                 Regulation 411.3.1.1 requires installations that provide protection against electric shock
                                using ADS to have a cpc run to and terminated at each point in t h e wiring and at
                                each accessory. An exception to this is m a d e for a lampholder having n o exposed-
                                conductive-parts and suspended f r o m such a point.


                                 Regulation 643.2.1 requires that a continuity check b e carried out o n all protective
                                conductors.              This includes the earthing conductor, the protective                                    conductors        of all
                                 circuits, all main protective bonding conductors and, where applicable, all supplementary
                                bonding conductors.


                                 Regulation 643.2.1 also requires that a continuity check b e carried out o n each
                                conductor of every ring final circuit, including the line, neutral and protective conductors.


                                There are two widely used test methods that have evolved for checking protective
                                conductor continuity.                       Test method 1 uses the circuit cable shorted o u t and test
                                method            2 uses a supplementary                       length of test cable (this method being popularly
                                known as t h e 'wandering lead' method).

Instrument:    use a low-resistance ohmmeter         for these tests (see Section 4.3).


The relevant conductors, mentioned             above, should b e tested to verify that they are
electrically sound and correctly connected.


Test method 1, detailed in this item, as well as checking the continuity of the protective
conductor, measures (R 1 + R2) which, when added to the external impedance (Z e),
enables the EFLI(Z S) to b e checked against the design (see Sections 2.6.14 and 2.6.15).
(R 1 + R2) is the sum of the resistances of the line conductor, Ri, and the cpc, R2 .


Test readings may b e affected by parallel paths through exposed-conductive-parts
and/or extraneous-conductive-parts.


Parallel earth paths and effects on test readings

Inspectors should always b e aware of t h e possible existence of parallel earth return
paths. These may take t h e f o r m of metallic cable management products, extraneous-
conductive-parts   or, indeed, other metallic parts. Examples include installations
incorporating steel conduit, steel trunking, mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (MICC),
steel wire armoured (SWA) or other metal-sheathed            cables, equipment      and accessory
boxes fitted to metal stud walls or to the building fabric, and luminaires fitted in grid
ceilings. Such parallel paths exist in domestic, commercial and industrial installations.


The effect of parallel earth return paths is that the measured               value of protective
conductor continuity, R2) tends towards zero. It is often impractical and, in some cases,
impossible to carry out testing with some or all of the parallel paths disconnected and
the inspector must b e aware of this.


Test m e t h o d 1 (for circuits)
Make a temporary shorting link of cable and connect the line conductor to the protective
conductor at the distribution board or consumer unit. Then test between line and earth
terminals at each outlet i n the circuit, as shown in Figure 2.13. The resistance of the
test leads should either b e measured and deducted f r o m t h e readings obtained, or
auto-nulled by the test instrument,        which most m o d e r n instruments    are able to do.


Where the installation has all-insulated wiring (see notes o n parallel earth paths and
effects o n test results above) and the cable accessories are not in contact with earth,
then this test measures(Ri + R2), i.e. the resistance of the line conductor, R i plus the
resistance of t h e protective conductor, R2 , for that circuit which, if added to the EFLI
at the distribution board, can b e taken as t h e circuit's EFLI.lt is important to record
t h e value of (R 1 + R2) obtained at the circuit's extremity, namely the furthest circuit
distance f r o m t h e distribution   board.

This method can also be used to confirm a bonding connection between extraneous-
conductive-parts where it is not possible to see a bonding connection, for example,
where bonding d a m p s have been ’built in'. The test would b e d o n e by connecting
the leads of the test instrument between any t w o points, such as metallic pipes, and
looking for a suitably l o w reading taking into account the length of the protective
bonding conductor(s). Keep in mind, however, that 15 m of single-core                       6.0 m m 2 or
                                        2
2 5 m of single-core 10.0 m m conductor has a resistance of approximately 0.05 Q .
With such low resistances being measured, t h e resolution of the test instrument may
not permit an accurate reading to b e obtained (see Section 4.3) and therefore where
t h e expected resistance is less than 0.1 Q including contact resistances, a value n o t
exceeding 0.1 Q should b e used as a guideline acceptable reading. It should b e noted
that this is not the R2 resistance measured f r o m the MET to the bonding clamp or
adjacent pipework.


To verify that there is a low resistance connection to the actual extraneous-conductive-
part itself, t h e measured resistance to the terminal of a bonding clamp can be compared
with t h e measured resistance to the extraneous-conductive-part                 itself some distance
f r o m the clamp. An example of this method is shown in Figure 2.16.


Where metallic enclosures have b e e n used as t h e protective conductors, for example,

                                 Expected test results
                                 The results should first and foremost indicate no discontinuity in the protective
                                 conductors. For lengths of conductor, use Appendix B of this Guidance Note for
                                 resistance data. For joints across bonds by earth clamps and similar, the readings
                                 should approach 0.05 Q , taking into account t h e resolution of the instrument,                                  its

                                 2.6.6 Continuity of ring final circuit conductors
                                 A three-step test is required to verify t h e continuity of t h e line, neutral and protective
                                 conductors a n d the correct wiring of every ring final circuit. The test results show if t h e
                                 ring has b e e n interconnected                to create an apparently continuous ring circuit, which is
                                 i n fact broken or connected as a ’figure of eight' configuration.


                                Instrument', use a low-resistance ohmmeter                             for this test (see Section 4.3).


                                 Step 1
                                 The line, neutral and protective conductors are visually identified at the distribution
                                 board or consumer unit and t h e end-to-end                       resistance of each is measured separately
                                 (see Figure 2.17).

                                These resistances are referred t o as n, rn and r 2, respectively. A reading that indicates
                                a n o p e n circuit, or resistance higher than the continuity                          measurement   range, shows
                                there is likely to b e a damaged conductor, or an issue with the integrity of connections
                                or terminations, along t h e ring conductors under test. The resistance values obtained
                                should b e of t h e same order if the conductors are of the same length, csa and material.
                                If t h e protective             conductor has a reduced csa, the resistance r 2 of the protective
                                conductor loop will b e proportionally higher than that of the line or neutral loop.
                                Because the resistance of a cable is inversely proportional to t h e area, w e can calculate

For example, for 2.5 m m 2 /1.5 m m 2 cable:

                               r          x r       =   1

If the resistance readings are not as expected, this could mean the following:

(a) readings lower than the expected resistance would suggest that the ring is
    incorrectly configured, possibly wired in a 'figure of eight’ connection; this may
    be further confirmed by the step 2 test below; or
(b) readings higher t h a n the expected resistance would suggest an issue with
    the integrity of one or more conductor terminations.

The 'expected resistance' is that found from the tabulated DC resistance for the
conductor csa per metre, multiplied by the installed length and corrected for ambient
temperature. A small allowance should be made for instrument errors. Table B i gives
values of DC resistance for conductors.

Step 2
The open ends of the line and neutral conductors are then connected together so that
the outgoing line conductor is connected to the returning neutral conductor, and vice
versa (see Figure 2.18).

The resistance between line and neutral conductors is measured at each socket-outlet.
The readings at each of the socket-outlets connected to the ring should be substantially
the same and the value will be approximately one-quarter of the resistance of the line
plus the neutral loop resistances, i.e. (ri + rn)/4 (see mathematical explanation in
Figure 2.19). Any socket-outlets wired as spurs will indicate a higher resistance value,
due to the resistance of the spur conductors.


Note:    Where single-core cables are used, care should be taken to verify that the line and
         neutral conductors of opposite ends of the ring circuit are connected together. An
         error in this respect will b e apparent from the readings taken at the socket-outlets,
         progressively increasing in value as readings are taken towards the midpoint of the
         ring, then decreasing again towards the other end of the ring. Where such behaviour
         in readings is between particular points part way round the ring, this may indicate an
         interconnection within the ring.

                                         flat twin-and-earth cable is used, the resistance will increase as t h e tests move
                                         around t h e ring f r o m t h e origin of t h e circuit, to a maximum        of approximately
                                        C i + r 2 )/4 at the mid-point of the ring, and decrease as the test point moves
                                        back towards the origin of the circuit. The maximum a n d minimum values
                                         expected during the test are shown in Table 2.8 (see IET Electrical Installation
                                         Design Guide for a comprehensive mathematical explanation).


                                 A higher resistance value will b e recorded at any socket-outlets or other accessories
                                 wired as spurs.


                                 The highest value recorded represents the maximum (R] + R£) of the circuit and is
                                 recorded o n the Schedule of Test Results. The value can b e used to determine                          the
                                 EFLI (Z s) of the circuit to verify t h e provisions for automatic disconnection of supply
                                 (see Section 2.6.14).


            411.3.2.5            The inspector is again reminded to take note of t h e effects of possible parallel return
               4193              paths o n these continuity tests, as described in Section 2.6.5 o f this Guidance Note.
                                 In addition, where supplementary       protective equipotential   bonding is used in
                                 accordance with Regulations 411.3.2.4 and 419.3, this may also affect the readings for
                                 step 3. Examples of circuits which may b e affected in this way include distribution circuits
                                 and final circuits supplying central heating systems, electric showers, or water heaters.

643.3 2.6.7     Insulation    resistance
      Insulation resistance testing is a fundamental      test for inspectors. Often, o n larger
      construction   sites, cables will b e insulation resistance tested during various stages of
      installation, to prove the integrity of installed cables. It is always preferred to re-test
      cables and equipment for insulation resistance as part of initial verification, as well
      as during construction. BS 7671:2018+A2:2022          permits t h e test voltage applied t o
      circuits following connection   of equipment   to b e reduced to 2 5 0 V DC, provided that
      cables were tested at 5 0 0 V DC prior to connection.

                   643.3          BS 7 6 7 1 requires that insulation resistance is measured between all of the live
                                  conductors and between the live conductors and the protective conductor, with the
                                  protective conductor connected t o t h e earthing arrangement. During t h e test between
                                  live conductors and the protective conductor, the live conductors may b e connected
                                  together. Taking cables as an example, historically, it was acceptable to test a cable
                                  between the various cores, and test to earth (which was actually only the cpc, such as
                                  a single-core conductor, o r the armouring or sheath of the cable); sometimes, these
                                  cables were terminated without further testing. This is n o longer acceptable: it is n o w
                                  essential to test to t h e protective conductor (such as armouring) with this connected
                                  - via a fly-lead if necessary - to the installation earthing arrangement.             This is shown
                                  in Figure 2.23. It is a good idea to test all cables, including those tested during the
                                  construction              stage, using this method.


                                  The purpose of the insulation resistance test is t o verify that the insulation of conductors
                                  is not damaged and that live conductors or protective conductors are not short-circuited.


                                  As a reminder, prior to carrying out t h e test, t h e inspector should check that:


                                  (a) t h e protective conductor of t h e i t e m (switchgear or cable, etc.) is connected to
                                         t h e MET, which must b e connected to the means of earthing.
                                  (b) pilot or indicator lamps, and capacitors, are disconnected f r o m circuits, to avoid
                                      an inaccurate test value being obtained (see Note below).
                                  (c) voltage-sensitive electronic equipment, such as dimmer switches, touch switches,
                                          delay timers, power controllers, electronic starters for fluorescent lamps, emergency
                                          lighting, RCDs and similar equipment is disconnected, so that it is not subjected
                                         to the test voltage. The functional earthing leads of residual current circuit-breakers
                                          (with overcurrent protection) (RCBOs) should also be disconnected, to prevent a
                                          low insulation resistance reading or damage to an RCBO.
                                  (d) the incoming neutral has been disconnected/isolated, where necessary, so that
                                         there is n o connection to Earth.


                                  Notes:
                                  1      Great care should b e taken w h e n removing neutral conductors or neutral links
                                         o n installations: the m o m e n t the neutral is removed, it may become live, if
                                         there is a 'borrowed neutral' o n t h e installation. Insulated tools should b e used
                                         for this task.
                                 2        (b) and (c) are necessary because,               as testing occurs between   all conductors,
                                         anything connected and in circuit will b e subjected to t h e test voltage.


                                 Instrument: use an insulation resistance tester (see Section 4.4).


             Table 64            Insulation resistance tests should be carried out using the appropriate DC test voltage
                                 specified in Table 6 4 of BS 7671. The installation will b e d e e m e d to conform with

Simple installations that contain no distribution           circuits should preferably b e tested as
a whole (see example in Figure 2.21).


The tests should b e carried out with the main switch off, all fuses in place, switches
and circuit-breakers closed (i.e., in their O N positions), lamps removed, and fluorescent
and other discharge luminaires and other equipment disconnected. Where the removal
of lamps and/or the disconnection             of current-using equipment         is impracticable,       the
local switches controlling such lamps and/or equipment should b e open. An insulation
resistance test of line and neutral (L&N) connected together to Earth (E) will ensure
that all t h e circuit conductors are tested. Where there are special lighting controls,
such as contactor switching, all the circuit wiring, including such switch-lines, must b e
included in the testing.


Complex installations, or other installations where the overall installation presents a l o w
value, may n e e d to b e subdivided into their component                parts to perform insulation
resistance tests.


Although an insulation resistance value as low as 1 M Q would comply with the
requirements        of the Regulations, a new installation should not yield a test result this
low. In n e w installations, a value below 20 M Q should b e investigated.

                                  Figure 2.21 shows an example of testing a whole consumer unit (i.e., an installation)
                                  in one test (only the L-N test is shown). The tests required are a test between the
                                  live conductors (L-N) and tests between t h e live conductors and earth (L-Eand N-E).

          Circuits with equipment that might influence the result of, or be damaged
          during, an insulation resistance test
643.3.3   Some electronic equipment            may be susceptible to damage by insulation resistance
          tests, for example where electronic components                   that are not intended to withstand
          voltages of 5 0 0 V DC.


          Other equipment  may influence                 the    measurement       being    made.        For example,
          equipment may have:


          (a) electronic     components o r transformers connected between                        line and neutral,
               which present a relatively low resistance;
          (b) electronic control devices that use multipole                relays or contactors disconnecting
               all live conductors (including neutral), which return to the o p e n state w h e n
               power is removed, such as when the circuit is made dead prior to test; and/or
          (c) certain protective        devices, such as RCCBs, RCBOs and AFDDs, as well as
               surge protection      devices and similar electronic components                 that present a low
               resistance during an insulation resistance test.


          Regulation 643.3.3 of BS7671 requires that circuits with this type of equipment                             have
          an insulation resistance test in two stages:


               (i)   When the circuit cables are first installed, an insulation                   resistance test is
                     carried out between        line conductors,       and between     line conductors a n d the
                     protective conductor,        with    t h e protective     conductor connected to                   the
                     earthing arrangement. Individual sections of a circuit may b e joined via
                     temporary connectors         in place of vulnerable equipment,                to test multiple
                     cable segments together in this way.
              (ii)   Following connection of equipment that might b e damaged by, o r influence,
                     the test, a test at 2 5 0 V D C is to b e applied between live conductors and
                     t h e protective conductor connected to t h e earthina arrangement.                               The
                     insulation resistance shall have a value of at least 1 M Q .

          three-phase 4-core power cable
          The cable is tested as per Table 2.10.

                              For experienced inspectors and testers, Table 2.11 shows h o w it is possible to reduce
                             t h e number of steps for insulation resistance to four. However, should any test yield
                             a reading lower than that referred to in Table 2.9, it will b e necessary to follow the

 643.3 2.6.8        Confirming             SELVor PELV circuits by insulation               resistance
                    testing
        In order to establish which insulation resistance tests are required for verifying a SELV
        or PELV system, t h e requirements of Section 414 of BS7671 must first b e understood.


        There are situations where the provision of insulation of SELVor PELV circuits for basic
        protection is generally not required by BS7671, i.e. forthe following voltages:


414.4.5 (a) up to 12 V AC or 3 0 V DC in wet areas; and
        (b) up to 2 5 V AC or 60 V D C in dry areas.


 Par    However, for locations containing a bath or shower, or i n swimming pools, saunas and
        some other special locations, basic protection by insulation is required for SELVand
        PELV at all voltages.


       It is often, therefore, easier to carry out insulation resistance tests o n these circuits as
        a matter of course.


        Where SELVor PELV is used as a protective measure, a n d insulation resistance testing
       is required, Tables 2.12 and 2.13 set out the requirements.


       Instrument:       use an insulation resistance tester for these tests (see Section 4.4).

          Additional inspections and tests for separated circuit supplying m o r e than
          one item of current-using equipment:
418.3.4   (a ) Apply a continuity test between all exposed-conductive-parts            of the separated
               circuit to ensure that they are b o n d e d together. Carry o u t a 5 0 0 V DC insulation
                 resistance test between the non-earthed protective bonding conductor and:
                 (i)   the protective conductors and/or exposed-conductive-parts of other circuits;and
                 (ii) extraneous-conductive-parts.
                  The insulation resistance should b e not less than 1.0 M Q . Instruments:                  use a
                 low-resistance ohmmeter      and an insulation resistance tester for these tests. See
                 Section 4.
          (b) All socket-outlets m u s t b e inspected t o ensure that the protective conductor
                 contact is connected to t h e non-earthed protective bonding system.
          (c) All flexible cables other than those supplying Class II equipment must b e
              inspected to ensure that they contain a protective conductor for use as an
                 unearthed     protective bonding conductor.
418.3.7   (d ) Operation of the protective device must b e verified by measurement of the
               fault loop impedances (i.e. between live conductors) to t h e various items of
                 connected equipment. These values should then b e compared with the
                 maximum       Z s value required by Regulation 411.4.5, with reference to the t y p e
                 and rating of the protective device for the separated circuit. For 2 3 0 V systems,
                 Tables 41.2 and 41.3 of Chapter 41 of BS 7671 may b e used for the maximum
                 Z s values for fuses and circuit-breakers, respectively. Although                these tables
                 pertain to t h e line/protective conductor loop path, and the measured values are
                 between live conductors, they give a reasonable approximation t o the values
                 required to achieve the required disconnection       time of Table 41.1.


          2.6.10 Testing of functional            extra-low    voltage (FELV) circuits
  411J    A FELV system is an extra-low voltage system meeting the requirements of Regulation
          Group 411.7 (Functional extra-low voltage (FELV)). The system does not m e e t all the
          requirements of Section 414 of BS 7671 relating to SELVor PELV.and its use is
          permitted only where SELVor PELVare not necessary.


          Regulation 643.3.2        requires that FELV circuits shall meet t h e test requirements                for
          LV circuits (such as 'mains voltage' circuits). This includes t h e testing of:


 $45      (a) continuity of protective conductors (see Section 2.6.5);
          (b) insulation resistance (see Section 2.6.7); the test voltage being 5 0 0 V DC and
                 t h e minimum    insulation resistance being 1 M Q   and
           c
 643.6    ( ) polarity (see Section 2.6.12).

          It should also b e checked by inspection that:


41L7.2    (a )   the
                       exposed-conductive-parts    of t h e FELV system are connected  to the
                 protective conductor of the primary circuit of the source, provided that the
                 primary circuit is subject to protection by ADS in accordance with Regulations
                 411.3 to 6;
           b     the
  411.7 ( )          source of t h e FELV system is one that meets t h e requirements of
                 Regulation 411.7.4; and
          (c) plugs,      socket-outlets,   luminaire   supporting    couplers      (LSCs), devices              for
                 connecting    luminaires (DCLs) and cable couplers in a FELV system are required
                 to have a protective conductor     contact (connected    to the protective          conductor)
                 and not b e dimensionally compatible with those used for any other systems in
                 use at the same premises.

Test electrode 1
The test electrode shown in Figure 2.25 comprises a metallic tripod, of which the
parts resting o n the floor f o r m the points of a n equilateral triangle. Each supporting
part is provided with a flexible base, ensuring, w h e n loaded, close contact with the
surface being tested over an area of approximately 9 0 0 m m 2 and having a combined
resistance of less than 5,000 Q between the terminal and the conductive rubber pads.


Before measurements      are made, the surface being tested is cleaned with a cleaning
liquid. While measurements          of t h e floors and walls are being made, a force of
approximately 7 5 0 N (75 kg in weight) for floors or 2 5 0 N for walls is applied t o the
tripod.

                         Expected results
                         The floors and walls are considered to b e non-conducting where t h e measured
                         resistances are at least 5 0 kQ (where the system voltage to Earth does n o t
                         exceed 500 V).


               645.5     A further test is specified in BS 7671 for extraneous-conductive-parts that are within
                         the location, b u t to which insulation has been applied during construction. I n these
                         cases, a 'flash' insulation tester is required, which, after t h e standard 5 0 0 V insulation
                         test, applies a 2 kV AC root mean square (rms) test and measures the leakage current
                         (which should not exceed 1 mA).


               643.6 2.6.12 Polarity               testing
                         The polarity of all circuits must b e verified before connection t o the supply, with either
                         an ohmmeter or the continuity range of an insulation and continuity tester. A typical
                         test o n a lighting circuit is shown in Figure 2.27.


                         Alternatively, polarity can b e verified by visually checking core colours at terminations,
                         thus verifying t h e installer's connections. Whatever m e t h o d is used, polarity checks are
                         required at all points o n a circuit to ensure that conductors have not been crossed at
                         intermediate      connection    points such as junction boxes.


                         Instrument', use a low-resistance ohmmeter for these tests (see Section 4.3).


                         A test for polarity is necessary to ensure that all fuses and single-pole control and
                         protective devices are connected in t h e line conductor. The centre contact of
                         screw-type lampholders must b e connected to the line conductor (except EI4 and E27
                         t o BS EN 60238), so this needs to be verified, as does the correct connection           of all
                         non-reversible      plugs and socket-outlets. It is important    to remove all other lamps o n
                         t h e circuit, as these may provide a conductive path between          line and neutral which
                         would t h e n permit an incorrectly connected lampholder to indicate continuity.


                         Note:       The continuity test (see Section 2.6.5) and ring final circuit continuity test
                                     (see Section 2.6.6) help to confirm polarity.

          The accuracy of t h e measurement using this technique is typically 1.2 times t h e
          percentage deviation of t h e readings. It is difficultto achieve an accuracy of measurement
          better than 2 °/o,and inadvisable to accept readings that differ by m o r e than 5 7o. In
          this event, to improve the accuracy of the measurement,             t h e test must b e repeated
          with a larger separation between the electrode under test and the current spike.


          The test instrument output may b e AC o r reversed DC to overcome electrolytic effects.
          Because these instruments employ phase-sensitive detectors, the errors associated
          with stray currents are eliminated.


          The instrument should b e capable of checking that the resistance of the temporary
          spikes used fortesting iswithinthe accuracy limits stated in t h e instrument specification.
          This may b e achieved by an indicator provided on the instrument,             or t h e instrument
          should have a sufficiently high upper range to enable a discrete test to b e performed
          o n the spikes.


          Where the resistance of the temporary spikes is t o o high, measures to reduce the
          resistance will b e necessary, such as driving the spikes deeper into the ground or
          watering with brine t o improve t h e contact resistance. Umno c i r c u m s t a n c e s should
          the latter technique b e used to temporarily                reduce the resistance            of t h e
          e a r t h electrode under test.


          ON COMPLETION             OF THE TEST, ENSURE THAT THE EARTHING                    CONDUCTOR
          IS    RECONNECTED,             BEFORE          THE   INSTALLATION     IS    ENERGIZED            (OR
          RE-ENERGIZED).


          Test method E2: Measurement using a dedicated stakeless or clamp
          based earth electrode tester
643.7.2   A number of types of earth electrode resistance tester are available that utilize clamps
 542.1    and can carry o u t measurements without the earth electrode under test having t o b e
          disconnected      from the installation. The use of two such types is described here.

          I n s t r u m e n t using o n e test c o i l


          The instrument described here uses a m e t h o d of measurement similar to the fall o f
          potential m e t h o d (test method E l , described earlier), in that it uses two temporary test
          spikes (electrodes), as shown in Figure 2.29. These are placed in the ground, away
          f r o m t h e earth electrode under test, in similar fashion to that described for t h e fall in
          potential method.

                         The clamp containing the test coil is placed around the earth electrode                   under test,
                         o r around the conductor         connected to that electrode. This eliminates the effects of
                         parallel resistances, so that only the resistance earth electrode under test is measured.


                         The resulting level of accuracy is similar to that given by the fall of potential method.

                         Instrument       using two test coils


                        The instrument          described here relies for its operation o n there effectively being a
                        number of earth electrodes within t h e installation, and not just the electrode under
                        test. The electrodes other than the one under test might not b e actual earth electrodes;
                        they might b e extraneous-conductive-parts                  buried in the ground o r in concrete buried
                        in the ground, such as metallic services pipes or buried structural metalwork or, in TN
                         systems, the means of earthing of the supply if this is connected during t h e test.


                        The instrument uses two coils placed a small distance apart around the earthing
                        conductor of t h e installation, as shown i n Figure 2.30, by means of clamps forming
                        part of t h e instrument. In practice, t h e coils may b e combined into a single clamp. O n e
                        coil induces a known voltage in a loop circuit containing t h e earth electrode under test,

            Electrode under
            test (having
            resistance to
            Earth RE )




The instrument         carries out a calculation using the formula below. This produces a
resistance reading intended to represent the resistance of the earth electrode under test.


                                 Rreading =    + J.+ _L+ _L+>>-+ J.

where:

          reading is   the resistance reading given by the test instrument
         Re is the actual resistance of the earth electrode under test
         Rb R 2 etc. are the resistances of the other 'earth electrodes'


The accuracy of the test reading ( R rea ding) depends on t h e existence of multiple parallel
paths for t h e returning test current to t h e instrument,             such that t h e effective parallel
resistance of these paths is low enough to b e neglected.


For example, if there were four other 'earth electrodes', effectively connected i n parallel,
each having a resistance of, say, 4 0 Q, their combined resistance would b e 10 Q . If the
resistance of the earth electrode under test was 100 Q, the total resistance, Rrea ding.
measured by t h e test instrument would be 100 Q +10 Q=110 Q . Consequently, the
measured value ( Rrea ding) would b e 1 1 o 7o of the actual value (RE), an error of 10 °/o.


However, if there was only one earth electrode other than the o n e under test, the error
in the measurement could b e significantly greater, as t h e effective path would t h e n b e
through t w o electrodes effectively connected in series. Using the same values as in
the previous example, this would m e a n that the resistance, Rrea din g , measured by the
test instrument would be 100 Q + 4 0 Q =140 Q . Consequently, Rrea ding would then
b e 140 7 o o f the actual value (R E), an error of + 4 0 7o.

          Where a time-delayed RCD is used t o provide fault protection, t h e maximum value
          of EFLI, including t h e earth electrode resistance, must b e such that the requirements
          of 411.3 and 411.5 are met. This is likely to require a lower figure than given above.


          The table indicates that the use of a suitably rated RCD will theoretically allow m u c h
          higher values of R A, and therefore of Z s, than could b e expected by using the circuit
          overcurrent devices for fault protection.


          Note:     It is advised, however, in Note 2 of Table 41.5, that earth electrode resistance values
                    above 2 0 0 Q may not b e stable, as soil conditions change due to factors such as soil
                    drying and freezing.


 643.7    2.6.14 Protection by automatic disconnection of supply (ADS)
          The effectiveness of measures for fault protection by ADS can b e verified for installations
          within a TN system by:


          (a) measurement of EFLI (as described in 2.6.15);
          (b) confirmation by          visual inspection     that    overcurrent      devices      have     suitable
              short-time     or instantaneous tripping setting for circuit-breakers, or current rating
              (l n) and t y p e for fuses; and
          (c) where RCDs are employed      to meet disconnection times for ADS, testing to
              confirm that the disconnection times of Chapter 41 of BS 7671 can b e m e t by
              verifying EFLI, and testing operation of RCDs (see Sections 2.6.15 and 2.6.18).


          For installations within a TT system, effectiveness can be verified by:


          (a) measurement         of    the     resistance   of     the    earthing     arrangement         of    the
              exposed-conductive-parts of the equipment               for the circuit in question;
          (b) confirmation      by     visual   inspection   that    overcurrent      devices      have     suitable
              short-time     or instantaneous tripping setting for circuit-breakers, or current rating
              (l n) and type for fuses; and
          (c) where RCDs are employed, testing to confirm that the disconnection times of
              Chapter 41 of BS 7671 can b e met by verifying EFLI, and testing operation of
              RCDs (see Sections 2.6.15 and 2.6.18).


 643.     Where RCDs are required for additional protection,                 this is verified by testing the
          operation of RCDs (see Section 2.6.18).


643.7.3   2.6.15 Earth fault loop impedance (EFLI) verification
          Where limitation of EFLIis part of a protective measure, it is fundamental that t h e initial
          verification process includes verification of EFLIs.

                                 The earth fault current loop comprises the following elements, starting at the point of
                                 fault o n t h e L-Efault loop:


                                 (a) the cpc;
                                 (b) the MET and earthing conductor;
                                 (c) for TN systems, t h e metallic return path or, in t h e case of TT and IT systems,
                                         t h e earth return path;
                                 (d) t h e path through the earthed neutral point of the transformer;
                                 (e) the transformer winding (or the equivalent in another source of energy); and
                                 (f) the line conductor f r o m the ’source’ to t h e point of fault.


                                 There are two methods used for verifying total EFLIfor a circuit:


                                  1      measurement                 of total EFLI(Zs) using an EFLItester, where it is safe to d o so; or
                                 2       measurement                 of (R] + R 2) during continuity         testing of a circuit (see Sections
                                         2.6.5 and 2.6.6) and addition to the measured EFLI external to that circuit (Z e).


                                 The latter is preferred w h e n determining Z s for final circuits and distribution circuits.

                                 Measurement                    of Z s is made o n a live installation and, for safety and practical reasons,
                                 neither the connection with Earth nor bonding conductors are disconnected. Where
                                 measurements are made close to a transformer, an instrument with suitable resolution
                                 is required.


                                 Instrument:             use an EFLItester for this test (see Section 4.5).


                                 Note:             An EFLItester may not produce an accurate reading in installations with grid-connected
                                                   or island-mode (grid-forming) inverters (see Section 2.6.24).

                                 This procedure is described in Section 2.6.5 and, for ring circuits, Section 2.6.6. The
                               (Ri -I- R 2) value recorded for a particular circuit is added to the EFLI at the origin of

                                 F o r a consumer unit at t h e origin of an installation, this is as follows:


                                                                                     Zs = Ze + (Ri + R2)

                                 where:


                                  Zs                        is the total EFLI in Q
                                  Ze                            is the external EFLI'external' to the installation
                                  (R 1 + R2 )                   is the measured resistance of t h e line conductor and cpc, measured
                                                                during the continuity test method 1 or step 3 of the ring circuit
                                                                continuity test.


                                 For consumer units or distribution boards not at the origin, confusion can arise over the
                                 term 'external EFLI'(Z e) and some prefer to write or note t h e EFLI at the distribution
                                 board as Zdb- As this value is not external to the installation, the formula is modified to:


                                                                                     Zs = Zdb + (Ri + R2)

          Circuit-breakers a n d residual current devices (RCDs)
          The test (measuring)         current of EFLI testers may trip some types of 6 A Type B
          circuit-breakers and any RCD protecting t h e circuit. This will prevent a measurement
          being taken and may result in a n unwanted disconnection of supply to the circuit
          under test.


          Instrument        manufacturers   can supply l o o p testers that are less liable to trip RCDs by
          either limiting t h e test current (to less than 15 mA) or by DC biasing (this technique
          saturates the core of the RCD prior to applying the test).


          M e a s u r e m e n t o f external EFLI (Z e)
          The externa
542 4 2               l EFLI, Z e , is measured using an EFLItester at the origin of the installation.
          The impedance measurement is made between t h e line conductor of the supply and
          the means of earthing with                t h e main   switch open   or with         all t h e circuits
          isolated. The means of earthing must b e disconnected f r o m t h e installation MET for
          t h e duration of t h e test, to remove parallel paths. Care should b e taken to avoid any
          shock hazard to the testing personnel and other persons on the site, both whilst
          establishing contact and whilst performing t h e test. It is strongly recommended to
          check         for diverted neutral   currents    where there is a TN-C or TN-C-S earthing
          arrangement, or where PME conditions apply (see Appendix E).


          ENSURE THAT THE EARTH CONNECTION                         H A S BEEN RECONNECTED BEFORE
          THE INSTALLATION             IS ENERGIZED (OR RE-ENERGIZED).

                                  Determining                   external EFLI(Ze) by enquiry
                                  The external EFLI,Ze, can b e determined                by enquiry with the electricity      distributor.
                                  However, if this is relied upon, a test must b e made to verify that t h e D N O earthing is
                                  effective. A test lamp may b e used to check that current is able t o pass between line
                                  and the means of earthing. Alternatively, an EFLItester can b e used to verify that the
                                  value of Ze is consistent with that quoted by the distributor o r measured previously.


                                  Verification of EFLItest results
                  643 J           K i s important to recognize that BS 7671 requires the inspector not only to test the
                                  installation, but also to compare the results with relevant design criteria (or with criteria
                                  within BS7671). This may seem obvious, b u t it is not u n c o m m o n for some inspectors
                                  to pass test information back to their office without making the necessary comparisons,
                                  possibly assuming that t h e office or someone else will check t h e results. The office
                                  might then assume that t h e inspector has checked t h e results against criteria, whereas
                                  in fact, no-one               has. It is important to remember       that the person w h o signed the
                                  certificate is responsible. Employees should follow their employer's                     procedures    in
                                  respect of methods for determination of prospective fault current.


                                  Values of Zs should b e compared with o n e of the following:

        643.7.3.201              2.6.16 Prospective fault current (l pf )
                                 Regulation 643.7.3.201                introduces the requirements of Regulation 434.1 into t h e
                                 testing section, with the designer required to determine t h e prospective fault current
                                 under both short-circuit and earth fault conditions a t every relevant point o f t h e
                                 installation. This may b e done by calculation, b e ascertained by enquiry or b e
                                 measured              directly using an instrument    (inspection).    The expression 'every relevant
                                 point’ means every point where a protective device is required to operate under fault
                                 conditions,            and includes the origin of the installation. Appendix 14 provides s o m e
                                 further guidance on these requirements.


                                 The inspector must have knowledge of the design in this respect as, for example, if t h e
                                 switchgear at the origin of a n installation is suitably rated for prospective fault current,
                                 a n d switchgear of similar short-circuit rating is used downstream                 of that point, then
                                 n o further checks will b e necessary. This is because the magnitude of the prospective
                                 fault current decreases with increasing distance downstream                    of the origin, assuming
                                 there is not another source of supply, such as a generator, connected to t h e installation
                                 at a point other than the main supply terminals of the installation. Any fault current
                                 contribution f r o m a generator must b e included if the generator can operate in parallel
                                 with the supply. If a generator or other source can supply the installation in place of

                                                                                                                           2

t h e normal supply, then generally fault currents will b e significantly lower and t h e
protection may take longer to clear a fault, making it possible that t h e l 2 t contribution
could cause thermal damage t o some cables or equipment.


Regulation 434.5.1 requires that, except where back-up protection is provided by
another device in accordance with the second paragraph of that regulation, the breaking
capacity rating of each protective device shall be not less than the prospective fault
current at its point of installation. The t e r m 'prospective        fault current' includes t h e
prospective short-circuit current and the prospective earth fault current. The maximum
prospective fault current at the point of installation of a protective device is the greater
of these t w o prospective fault currents at that point, which should b e determined and
compared with the breaking capacity of the device.


W i t h t h e p o w e r on, the m a x i m u m v a l u e of t h e prospective short-circuit current
can b e obtained by direct connection of t h e instrument between live conductors at
the protective device at t h e origin or other relevant location within t h e installation. Both
two-lead and three-lead instruments capable of determining prospective fault current
are available; it is important that any instrument        used is set to the correct range and
connected i n accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for its use. Failure to do
so could b e dangerous, could result in damage to t h e instrument and might result in
misleading readings being obtained.


Instrument:   use the prospective fault current range of a suitable EFLItester for this test
(see Section 4.5, final paragraph).


With some instruments,       the voltage between        line conductors      cannot b e measured
directly. Where this is t h e case, it can b e assumed that for three-phase supplies,
the maximum      balanced prospective short-circuit level will be, as a rule of thumb,
approximately twice the single-phase value. This figure errs o n the side of safety.


Where a n instrument is rated for the higher voltage, a more accurate prospective fault
current measurement, for a three-phase installation, can b e obtained by measuring the
line-to-line fault current and dividing the measured result by 0.87.


Prospective earth fault current may b e obtained with the same instrument. Again, care
must b e taken to ensure that t h e instrument is set correctly and connected as per the
manufacturer's instructions for use.


Appendix 14 of BS 7671 provides a reminder                  of the hazards involved          in taking
measurements      directly from live parts. Guidance in HSE publication              HSR25 should
b e followed.


It is recommended       t h a t alternative m e a n s a r e u s e d t o d e t e r m i n e prospective
fault current w h e r e possible.


Where a measurement of prospective fault current is necessary, it should always b e
made downstream of a protective device rated for t h e anticipated prospective fault
current. Fused test leads alone are not considered suitable for this purpose, and, in t h e
absence of a suitable protective device, a temporary one should b e fitted.


Note:    A prospective fault current tester may not produce an accurate reading in installations
         with grid-connected or island-mode (grid-forming) inverters (see Section 2.6.24).

                                 The values obtained should b e compared with t h e breaking capacity of t h e appropriate
                                 protective device. The breaking capacity of t h e protective device should b e greater
                                 than the highest value of prospective fault current obtained using the instrument.


                                 Whichever is the greater of the prospective                           short-circuit    current and the prospective
                                  earth fault current obtained should be recorded o n the EIC,EICRand the Schedule of
                                 Test Results, as appropriate.


                                 If t h e measured value of prospective fault current appears to exceed t h e fault current
                                  rating for t h e equipment                or protective device, further consideration m u s t b e given to
                                 the current-limiting              effect of any upstream protective devices and the ability for the
                                 source of supply to deliver the indicated prospective fault current. The maximum value
                                 of prospective fault current for an installation will be with t h e installation unloaded and
                                 t h e conductors at ambient temperature.


                                 F o r a three-phase system, the prospective three-phase short-circuit current will always
                                 b e larger than the single-phase line-to-neutral                        or earth fault currents.


                                  Note on the accuracy of EFLIand prospective fault current testers (see also
                                  Sections 2.6.24 and 4.5)

                                  EFLI testers become less accurate at low value impedance readings, such as w h e n
                                  measuring              close to a transformer             or other low impedance            source. It should b e
                                  noted that the standard instrument                        used for determining        prospective fault current is
                                  effectively an EFLI instrument.


                                  While earth fault loop testers should have a resolution of at least 0.01 Q, this should
                                  not b e confused with accuracy.


                                  A displayed test result of less than about 0.1 Q, or about 1.0 Q,when o n the lower
                                  current range (such as 15 mA), could b e prone to significant errors. Such errors can
                                  significantly affect the calculation o f prospective fault current.


                                  Should more accurate measurements b e needed o n large installations with very low

                                  Note:            An EFLI and prospective          fault   current   tester   may not produce     a n accurate reading

   Two short-circuit capacity ratings are defined in BS EN 6 0 8 9 8 and BS EN 61009:
  l c n : the rated short-circuit capacity (marked o n t h e device); and
  l c s : the service short-circuit capacity.




                                                                                Guidance N o t e 3: Inspection & Testing     91
                                                                           © The Institution of Engineering and Technology

                                  The difference between the two short-circuit ratings described above is the condition
                                  of the circuit-breaker after manufacturer's                 testing.


                                  I c n is the maximum fault current that the device can interrupt safely, although its
                                  characteristics may have been altered and i t may n o longer b e usable.


                                  Ics is the maximum                     fault current that the      device can interrupt safely without
                                  loss of performance.


                                 The l c n value (for example, 6,000)                      is marked o n the device in a rectangle. For
                                 t h e majority of applications, t h e prospective                  fault current at t h e terminals of t h e
                                  circuit-breaker should not exceed this value.


                                  For domestic installations, t h e prospective fault current is unlikely to exceed 6 kA, up to
                                  which value l c n will equal l cs - (For domestic installations, the D N O may specify a higher
                                 fault current value - perhaps up t o 16 kA - but this level is rapidly reduced through
                                 the impedance                  of t h e supply cables.)


                                 For switchgear, the relevant fault current (short-circuit)                      rating of t h e switchgear
                                  (or assembly) should b e equal t o or exceed the maximum prospective fault current
                                 at the point of connection to the system. For non-domestic installations o n the public
                                 supply network, this information will have to b e obtained f r o m t h e local DNO.


                                 The terminology                  to define the short-circuit     rating of an assembly is given in the
                                 BS EN 61439 series of standards as follows:


                                 (a)     rated short-time withstand current l cw ;
                                 (b) rated peak withstand current Ipij and
                                 (c) rated conditional short-circuit current l cc .


                                 Further details are provided in Guidance Note 2.


                                 Fault currents up to 16 kA
                                 Except in London and some other major city centres, the maximum                           fault current for
                                 2 3 0 V single-phase supplies up to 1 0 0 A is unlikely to exceed 16 kA. Appendix 14 of
                                 BS7671 advises that it is often not necessary to measure o r calculate the prospective
                                 fault current at the origin of individual dwellings or similar premises i n which the
                                 distributor has declared the prospective fault current to b e 16 kA:


                                 In dwellings (household) or similar premises, where a consumer unit to BS EN 61439-3
                                 is used and the maximum                      prospective    fault current declared by the distributor     is
                                 16 kA, it is n o t necessary t o measure or calculate prospective fault current at the origin
                                 of the supply.


                                 The term 'distribution board for operation by ordinary persons' used in BS EN 61439-3
                                 applies to a wider range of products                       than a domestic   consumer    unit. The 16 kA
                                 conditional rating applies only to consumer units as defined in B S 7 6 7 1 as follows:


                                 Consumer unit (may also b e k n o w n as a consumer control unit or electricity control
                                 unit). A particular type of distribution board intended for operation by ordinary persons,
                                 comprising             a type-tested      co-ordinated     assembly for t h e control and distribution   of
                                 electrical energy, incorporating manual means of double-pole isolation on the incoming
                                 circuits) and an assembly of one or more protective devices, signalling and other
                                 devices proven during the type-test of t h e assembly as suitable for such use.

                nominal voltage of up to 2 5 0 V A C ;
           (b) the service cutout is a fuse rated 100 A or less complying with either BS 1361

                        in Annex ZB of t h e standard), incorporating only components and protective
                        devices specified by t h e manufacturer; or
               (ii)     (for initial verification of additions a n d alterations to existing installations

                        •    BS 5486-13:1989;    or
                        •    BS EN 60439-3        (including     the    16 kA conditional           short-circuit          test
                             described in Annex ZA of the standard), incorporating                only components
                             and protective   devices specified        by the manufacturer          (see Regulations
                             432.1 and 530.3.4 of BS 7671:2008).


           Recording the prospective fault current
           Both t h e E l C a n d the EICR contain a section headed 'Nature of Supply Parameters',
           which requires the prospective fault current at the origin to b e recorded. The value to
           b e recorded is the greater of either the short-circuit current (between                   live conductors)
           o r the earth fault current (between        line conductors)      and the MET). If it is considered
           necessary to record values at other relevant points, this can b e done o n the Schedule
           of Test Results. Where the protective devices used at t h e origin have the necessary
           rated breaking capacity, a n d devices with similar breaking capacity are used throughout
           t h e installation, it can b e assumed that the Regulations are satisfied in this respect
           for all distribution boards (provided there is n o t another source of supply, such as a
           generator, connected to the installation at a point other than the main supply terminals
           of t h e installation)(see also Section 2.6.24).


           2.6.17       Phase sequence          testing

   643.9   Regulation 643.9 requires verification that the phase sequence is maintained for
           multiphase circuits within an installation. In practice, this will b e achieved by checking
           polarity a n d connections throughout the installation. While the regulation requires phase
           sequence to b e maintained throughout the installation, this should not b e confused
           with phase rotation. Phase rotation is a description of which way a correctly-wired
           three-phase induction motor will run. If t h e timing of t h e sine waves o n LI, L 2 and L3
           are such that LI precedes L2, which precedes L3, then t h e motor will run clockwise.
           If t h e timing of t h e sine waves is changed by swapping any two wires, as shown in
           Figure 2.32, then the motor will run anticlockwise. To ensure correct operation                                    of
           three-phase loads, for example three-phase laundry equipment, it is recommended                                    to
           test phase rotation at t h e point closest to the load, before the load is energized.


           Phase sequence           may b e confirmed,         with the installation/circuits          isolated, using
           continuity       testing as for continuity of conductors. This may b e carried out using the
           same method as Rj + R2 testing.

       2.6.18 Operation         and functional     testing   of RCDs
      The operating times of RCDs are required to b e tested i n t h e following circumstances:


643.7.1 (a) where they are relied o n for disconnection for compliance with Chapter 41 of
            BS7671; and
643.8 (b) where they are installed as additional protection,          as specified in Chapter 41 of
          BS 7671.


      Where RCDs are installed with circuit-breakers and the circuit has the characteristics to
      satisfy Chapter 41 of BS 7671 without the RCD,then testing of the RCDisnot essential
      unless it is specified for additional protection.


      Operation of R C D s
411.4.5 Before using a test instrument, the RCDtest button should b e pressed. This provides
4H.5.3 basic information that the RCD is functioning, and will help avoid danger that may
       occur during test if the RCD did not respond.


      BS EN 61557-6        requires the test current for a tripping test to b e applied at the
      zero-crossing point of the AC wave. Therefore, for each of the tests, readings should b e
      taken with the test waveform starting on both positive and negative half-cycles usually
      identified '0°' and '180°’ o n test instruments, and the longer operating t i m e recorded
      for t h e l x l An Type AC test.


      Prior to these R C D tests, it i s essential,       for safety reasons, that the EFLI i s
      tested to check the r e q u i r e m e n t s h a v e been met.

4   This test is required by Regulation 643.7 of BS 7671 (where the RCD is used for
    automatic disconnection of supply) or Regulation 643.8 of BS 7671 (where the RCD
    is used for additional protection). RCD to BS 4293 or BS 7288:1990 should meet the
    operating times of the appropriate product standard, where these are shorter than those
    specified in BS 7671 :201 8+A2:2022, because a longer operating time than that in the
    relevant product standard may indicate that the RCD is n o longer operating correctly.
    The longest tripping time for each of the two tests (0° and 180°) is recorded in
    column 2 8 of the Schedule of Test Results (see example in Figure 5.6).
5   Optional tests are intended for fault-finding and similar purposes only. The performance
    requirements of the optional tests are to be met by product manufacturers and are not
    BS 7671 requirements. Not all test instruments can perform all of the tests listed here
    (see note 1).
6   Since RCDs are only rated for a finite number of operations, carrying out frequent
    optional tests can shorten the product's life. For example, in carrying out all of the
    above tests, including optional tests, for a 30 mA Type B RCD, would require the RCD to
    trip 12 times.
7   For RCDs to harmonized standards (see note 2), with residual operating current l An 30 mA,
    the manufacturer may select a current for the Type AC 40 m s tripping test of 2 5 0 mA
    instead of 5 x l An . Where this is declared by t h e manufacturer, failing to trip within 4 0 m s
    at 5 x l An . does not necessarily mean the RCD is faulty. For this reason, and to prevent
    shortening the usable life of RCDs (see note 5), BS 7671:2018+A2:2022            does not
    require testing of RCDs at 5 x l An .

Note:     RCDs to BS 4293, and BS 7288:1 990, have no marking for residual current operating
          characteristic. They would be considered equivalent to Type AC RCDs if assessing their
          continued use with respect to additions to an existing installation downstream of the
          device. The designer should also consider that there have been other improvements
          in product standards for RCDs in relation to device characteristics, isolation,
          short-circuit rating, reliability, and electromagnetic compatibility.

                                  RCD test method 1: residual current test applied between line and
                                  protective conductor
                                  RCDtest method 1 is preferred where RCDs are used for fault protection, as it provides
                                  further validation that the RCD is operating within a specific t i m e for a simulated fault
                                  to t h e relevant protective conductor.


                                  The test is m a d e o n the load side of the RCD between                         t h e line conductor   of t h e
                                  protected circuit and the associated cpc. The load should b e disconnected during
                                  the test to avoid spurious results. These tests can result in a potentially dangerous
                                  voltage o n exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts when t h e EFLI
                                  approaches t h e maximum acceptable limits. Precautions m u s t therefore b e taken to
                                 prevent contact of persons o r livestock with such parts.


                                 It may not b e possible to use this test method                      conclusively in s o m e situations, for
                                 example where:


                                 (a) there is an upstream RCD for which there is n o selectivity, such as a test on an
                                         RCD in a caravan supplied f r o m a caravan site or repair workshop socket-outlet,
                                         where B S 7 6 7 1 requires that the socket-outlet and caravan both have additional
                                         protection by an RCD rated 3 0 m A or less. In these cases, either RCD may trip
                                         first, and it is n o t guaranteed that t h e disconnection t i m e measurement will b e
                                         that of t h e RCD under test.
                                 (b) protective                 conductor   currents   f r o m equipment       that cannot   b e disconnected
                                         f r o m the circuit under test, or f r o m other parts of the installation                   that are
                                         energized, affect the conditions               of the applied test so that the disconnection
                                         time measurement               is affected.
                                 (c) an RCD in an IT system is being tested, and there is n o current return path via
                                         a cpc.


                                 RCDtest method 2: upstream/downstream test
                                 Where RCDtest m e t h o d 1 cannot b e used conclusively, or it is not considered practicable
                                 or safe to conduct a n EFLI test prior to testing the RCD, RCD test m e t h o d 2 can b e
                                 considered. This method is outlined in Clause 6.3 of PD IEC/TR 6 2 3 5 0 Guidance for
                                 the correct use of residual current-operated                   protective devices (RCDs) for household
                                 and similar use, which states that the test method                        avoids risks associated with high
                                 resistance or disconnected                 protective conductors, a n d avoids instrument errors due to
                                 protective conductor currents.


                                 The test is m a d e between a live conductor o n the supply side (upstream) of t h e RCD
                                 and another live conductor o n the load side (downstream)                         of the RCD, for example:


                                 (a) single-phase RCDs, o r three-phase RCDs with a monitored neutral, between
                                         upstream neutral and downstream                  line; or
                                 (b) three-phase                 RCDs without neutral, between       either:
                                        (i)       upstream LI and downstream              L2;
                                       (ii)       upstream LI and downstream              L3;
                                      (iii)       upstream L 2 and downstream             LI;
                                      (iv)        upstream L 2 and downstream L3;
                                       (v)        upstream L3 and downstream L I ; or
                                      (vi)        upstream L3 and downstream L2.


                                 Note:            The instrument, test leads, and probes, must be rated for the line-to-line voltage of
                                                  the three-phase system at appropriate overvoltage category (see Section 1.1).

Examples of testing an RCCBand RCBOare shown in Figures 2.35 and 2.36 respectively.
These examples are included to illustrate the principles only. The person carrying out
the test should take all practicable steps to avoid the risk of contact with live parts,
such as the example shown in Figure 2.37. The test should only b e performed with
covers removed, in equipment where all line conductor terminals meet IP2X/IPXXB.

Before attempting this test method, check with the test equipment manufacturer's
instructions that the method is supported by the instrument. Some test instruments
require only two test leads to be connected during the test, but some require three
test leads.

                                   Integral test device
                  643.10           An integral test device is incorporated i n each RCD. This device enables t h e functioning
                                   of t h e mechanical parts of the RCD to b e verified by pressing t h e button marked T
                                   or 'Test 1.


                                   Operation of the integral test device does not provide a means of checking:


                                   (a) the continuity of the earthing conductor o r the associated cpcs;
                                   (b) any earth electrode or other means of earthing;
                                   (c) any other part of the associated installation earthing; or
                                   (d) the sensitivity of t h e device.


               514.12.2           The RCDtest button will only operate the RCD if it is energized. B S 7 6 7 1 recommends
                                  that the test button is pressed at least every 6 months.

                  643.10          Other equipment, including switchgear, controls and interlocks, should also b e
                                  functionally tested - that is, operated to confirm that they work and are properly
                                  installed, mounted a n d adjusted.


                                  The settings o n all adjustable relays and controls, etc. should b e checked to see that
                                  they align with the designer’s proposed requirements.                       RCD test buttons should b e

                                  n o means of functionally testing the t y p e without a test button.


                                  Circuit-breakers should n o t b e used as lighting switches o n a regular basis (as in some
                                  warehouses), unless they are approved by t h e manufacturers for such use.


                                  2.6.20 Verification                   of voltage drop
                                  Verification of voltage drop is not normally required during initial verification. It is usually
                                  sufficient to check that voltage drop calculations have been undertaken and that the
                                  design voltage drops are within the limits required in BS7671.


                                  Where it may b e necessary to verify that voltage drop does not exceed t h e limits stated
              Sect 525             In the relevant product standards of installed equipment, B S 7 6 7 1 provides guidance
                                  to d o so. Where no such limits are stated, voltage drop should be such that it does not
                                  impair t h e proper a n d safe functioning of installed equipment.


                                  Voltage drop problems are quite rare, but the inspector should b e aware that long runs
                                  of circuit conductors and/or high currents can sometimes cause voltage drop problems.

            Accurate measurement of voltage drop within an installation is not practical, as this
            would m e a n measuring the instantaneous voltage at both the origin and at t h e point of
            interest simultaneously, together with the instantaneous load current. An indication of
            voltage drop can b e obtained to ensure that it is not excessive for t h e proper functioning
            of the equipment by simple voltage measurement at the equipment terminals with t h e
            installation fully loaded.


            Voltage drop may b e determined by measurement of the combined live conductor
            resistance and by calculation using this value and the full load current of t h e equipment,
            with compensation     for conductor temperature     difference for measured and operating
            conductor values. This will determine voltage drop within the circuit, which can then
            b e used to verify compliance.


Table 4Ab   Appendix 4 of BS 7 6 7 1 gives maximum values of voltage drop for lighting and for
            other uses, depending u p o n whether an installation is supplied directly from a public
            LV distribution network o r f r o m a private LV supply. The voltage drop for general
            purposes in Appendix 4 exceed the requirements of s o m e product standards. For
            example, BSEN 61851-1:2011 for electric vehicle charging equipment requires charging
            points t o operate within a utilization voltage range of Uo ± 10 7o, which therefore
            requires a maximum          voltage drop of 4 7o in a consumer's      installation supplied in
            accordance with t h e ESQCR.


            It should b e remembered that voltage drop may exceed t h e values stated in Appendix 4
            in situations such as motor starting periods and where equipment               has a high inrush
            current, where such events remain within the limits specified in the relevant product
            standard or reasonable recommendation by a manufacturer.


            2.6.21   Verification of protection o f low voltage (LV) installations
                     against temporary overvoltages due to faults in the high
                     voltage (HV) or LV system

 Sect 442 The protection     referred to in this section of the Guidance Note is the subject of
            Section 4 4 2 of BS7671. F o r m o r e information, see Guidance Note 1.


  442.2.1 Temporary overvoltages due to a n HV system fault

  442.2.2   Regulations 442.2.1 and 442.2.2 give t h e requirements concerning the magnitude
            and duration of temporary overvoltages occurring due to a fault in t h e HV system
            (typically, 11 kV) supplying t h e substation f r o m which t h e LV installation is supplied.


  442.2.3   Regulation 442.2.3 points o u t that t h e requirements of Regulations 442.2.1 and
            442.2.2 are deemed to be met if the LV installation is supplied f r o m a system for
            distribution of electricity t o the public. This assumes that the public electricity supply
            distribution network is appropriately designed and constructed, as is the case in Great
            Britain. Where this is the case, there is n o need for the inspector to check compliance
            with Regulations 442.2.1 and 442.2.2.


  442.2.1 Where the LV installation is supplied from a privately owned substation, the design
  442.2.2 responsibility for complying with Regulations 442.2.1 and 442.2.2 rests with the
            designer(s) of t h e substation and the associated LV distribution network up to the
            incoming terminals of the LV installation. The inspector will need to b e in possession
            of sufficient information    provided by this party (or parties) about the intended means
            of compliance, to enable him or her to verify, so far as is reasonably practicable, that these
            means have been properly put into effect. Matters to b e checked by the inspector include:



                                                                                     Guidance N o t e 3 : I n s p e c t i o n & Testing   103
                                                                                © The Institution of Engineering and Technology
 2

                                   (a) that the HV and LV earthing arrangements of the substation have b e e n correctly
                                            installed and that their resistances to Earth meet the designer's requirements;
                                   (b) that t h e HV earthing and LV arrangements are interconnected or, where appropriate,
                                            separated, according to t h e designer's requirements;
                                   (c) that any global earthing         system or additional    connections   with Earth in the
                                           LV network that are relied o n for safety are in existence and properly installed,
                                           and that the resistance of connections with               Earth meets the     designer's
                                           requirements; and
                                   (d) that t h e rated currents and settings of protective devices are as intended by
                                           the designer.


                                   Temporary overvoltages due t o an LV system fault

                    442.3          Regulations 442.3, 442.4 and 442.5 require consideration to b e given to t h e stress
                                  voltages that would occur in an installation in t h e event of loss of the neutral conductor
                                  In a TN or TT system, a n earth fault in an IT system with distributed neutral, or a
                                  short-circuit between a line conductor and a neutral conductor.


                                  In practice, there is usually little that an installation      designer and constructor      can
                                  d o to meet the requirements          of these regulations beyond selecting and installing
                                  equipment with appropriate insulation voltage ratings, such as 600/1,000             V cables for
                                  an installation of nominal voltage of 2 3 0 / 4 0 0 V. The inspector should check that this
                                  has been done.


                                  2.6.22 Verification of protection against overvoltages                      of atmospheric
                                         origin or due t o switching
        Section                   The protection referred to in this section of t h e Guidance Note is the subject of
                     GN1          Section 443 of BS 7671. Formore information, see Guidance Note 1.


        Table 4 4 :               Irrespective of whether the electrical designer has chosen to specify SPDs, t h e
                                  inspector should check that all electrical equipment of the installation has been so
                                  selected and installed that, according to its product standards, it provides at least the
                                  applicable value of rated impulse voltage referred to in Table 443.2 of BS 7671. The
                                  values of rated impulse withstand voltage in that table are given according to the
                                  Category (I, II, III or IV) into which the equipment falls and to t h e nominal voltage of
                                  the installation. Table 4 4 3 . 2 of BS 7671 gives examples of equipment falling into each
                                  of the categories.


                                  Where protection against overvoltages by the use of SPDs has been specified by the
       Section 534                designer, the inspector should check that these have been selected and installed in
                                  accordance with t h e designer's requirements or otherwise in accordance with
                                  Section 5 3 4 of BS7671.


                                  The inspector needs t o verify that SPDs have n o t become expired or defective by
                                  ensuring that indicator lights are correctly illuminated or that the coloured flag or flags
                                  o n the devices indicate that they are serviceable. Remote status indicating facilities
                                  such as connection to an audible alarm may also have been provided and this should
                                  also b e checked for correct operation.

                                   BS IEC 61000-5-2 contains guidance o n good installation practices for inspection
                                   items, to achieve EMC. BS EN 50310 contains requirements for electrical tests to b e
                                   carried out for bonding networks in buildings containing ICT systems.


                                   While there are n o specific requirements                     in BS 7671 for either installers or inspectors
                                   to carry out electric field or magnetic field strength measurements, designs for certain
                                   installations may require such measurements to b e made, based o n assessments
                                   carried out at t h e design stage.



          chapter 82 2.6.24                        Prosumer's             electrical     installations     (PEIs)
                                   A PEI is one in which electrical energy is both produced and consumed. The simplest
                                   t y p e of PEI is an installation with a solar PV system.


                                  This section                   outlines particular considerations      for initial testing with this t y p e of
                                   installation. Further information,              including guidance on initial verification, can be found
                                   in the IET Code of Practice for Electrical Energy Storage Systems and the IET Code of
                                  Practice for Grid-Connected                   Solar Photovoltaic Systems.


                                  Note:             In PEIs, the term power conversion equipment (PCE) is used to describe both
                                                    inverters and AC-DC converters, as a single device, such as a combined inverter
                                                    charger for a battery storage system, may perform both functions.


                                  M u l t i p l e s u p p l i e s a n d safe i s o l a t i o n
                                  PEIsusually have m o r e than one source of supply. Isolation of the electrical installation
                                  for safe working o n certain parts of the installation will involve m o r e than one point
                                  of isolation.


                                  These should b e appropriately labelled in accordance with Regulation 514.15.1.


                                  It is essential to follow a rigorous approach to the identification of the correct points
                                  of isolation for t h e part of the system that is being worked on, along with the use of
                                  means of securing the points of isolation in t h e OFF position.


                                  Supply characteristics                    may change between             installation   operating   modes
                                  PEIshave operating modes as shown in Table 2.18. When t h e installation is operating
                                  in island mode, the supply characteristics are likely to b e different, as the installation is
                                  supplied by local generation (in t h e f o r m of power converters such as inverters) rather
                                  than the public distribution                 network. As a consequence           of moving from connected
                                  mode to island mode, for example:


                                  (a) The earthing arrangement may change, for example f r o m TN-C-S to TN-S, or
                                          f r o m TT to TN-S. A consumer's earth electrode may b e required.
                                  (b) The prospective                    fault current is likely to b e far less, and the effective         EFLI
                                          greater, than in connected                   modes of operation.      In smaller installations, there
                                          may be insufficient              fault current to operate overcurrent protective        devices, a n d
                                          RCDs or protection               built into electronic converters must b e used for protection
                                          against electric shock. Manufacturer’s instructions should b e consulted to check
                                          whether external protective devices are required.

          826.7 Grid-connected inverters operating in parallel with the public supply track the rise
                 and fall of the supply voltage. Consequently,           when a prospective fault current o r EFLI
                 measurement        is taken in a PEI in connected modes of operation, the contribution                   of
                 the inverter may b e masked by this behaviour.


                 In island mode, inverters can appear to b e a constant current source, up to t h e value
                 of their in-built current limit.


                 When a prospective fault current or EFLI measurement                is taken in a PEI in island mode,
                 especially using a 'no trip' or 'low current' setting usually used to avoid tripping RCDs,
                 the prospective fault current reading may b e much higher than t h e actual value, and
                 the EFLI lower.


                 The IET Code of Practice for Electrical Energy Storage Systems advises:


                 (a) external earth fault loop impedance and prospective fault current measurements
                        are carried out at the origin, with all PCE isolated.
                 (b) earth fault loop impedance              and prospective       fault current   measurements          for
                        the remainder of the installation are not taken unless all the inverters in the
                        system are isolated. In order to provide verification for automatic disconnection
                        of supply, t h e following tests can b e used:
                       (i)   for connected mode: the verification of                 earth fault loop impedance
                             (Zdb and Z$) is based o n the external earth fault loop impedance, Ze, plus
                             measured (R1+R2) values. Prospective fault current should b e the measured
                             prospective fault current plus the sum of t h e current limit of all connected
                             m o d e inverters.
                      (ii)   for island mode:        if applicable, verification   of earth fault loop impedance
                             (Zdb and Zs)         is determined using measured (R1+R2) values, plus the
                             manufacturer's       information regarding the value of Z e to b e assumed for the
                             EESSor the relevant PCE within it. Prospective fault current should b e t h e
                             sum of the current limit of all connected-mode inverters.

                 Note:       The prospective fault current measurement at the origin is not necessary if it can be
                             determined by other means (see Section 2.6.16).

Periodic inspection                                                                            3
and testing

         3.1      Purpose of periodic inspection and testing
 651.1   The purpose of periodic inspection and testing is to provide an engineering view o n
         whether or n o t an installation is in a satisfactory condition where it can continue to
         b e used safely.


         A detailed visual examination of the installation is required, together with         appropriate
         tests. The tests are mainly to confirm that the disconnection times stated in Chapter 41
         of BS 7 6 7 1 are met.


         The periodic inspection and testing is carried out, so far as is reasonably practicable, for:


         (a) the safety of persons and livestock against the effects of electric shock and bums;
         (b) protection     against damage      to   property by fire   and heat arising f r o m a n
             installation defect;
         (c) confirmation that t h e installation is not damaged or deteriorated so as to impair
             safety; and
         (d) the identification     of installation defects and departures f r o m the requirements
             of B S 7 6 7 1 that may give rise to danger.


         For an installation under effective supervision in normal use, periodic inspection
         and testing may b e replaced by a n adequate regime of continuous monitoring and
         maintenance of the installation and all its constituent equipment by skilled persons
         competent in such work. It is important in such a regime that maintenance records,
         with references to inspection and testing, are recorded and stored. Such records should
         b e available for scrutiny and n e e d not b e in the standard EICRformat.


         3.2      Necessity for periodic inspection                       and testing
         Periodic inspection and testing is necessary because all electrical installations deteriorate,
         due to a number of factors, such as damage, wear, tear, corrosion, excessive electrical
         loading, ageing and environmental influences. Consequently:


         (a) legislation requires that electrical installations are maintained     in a safe condition,
             and this lends itself to periodic inspection and testing (see also Tables3.1 and 3.2);
         (b) licensing authorities, public bodies, insurance companies, mortgage lenders and
             others may require periodic inspection and testing of electrical installations, as
             is, for example, the case for HMOs (see Tables 3.1 a n d 3.2); and




                                                                                  Guidance N o t e 3: Inspection & Testing    109

                                   (c) additionally, periodic inspection and testing should b e considered in t h e
                                           following circumstances:
                                           (i) to assess compliance               with BS 7671;
                                         (ii)       o n a change of occupancy of the premises (especially             for rented domestic
                                                    accommodation);
                                        (iii)       o n a change of use of t h e premises;
                                        (iv)        after additions or alterations to the original installation;
                                         (v)        where there is a significant change (increase) in the electrical loading of t h e
                                                    installation; and
                                        (vi)       where there is reason to believe that damage may have been caused to
                                                   t h e installation, as might b e the case, for example, after flooding.


                                   Reference to legislation and other documents                      is made below. It is vital that these
                                   requirements                  are ascertained before undertaking periodic inspection a n d testing.


                                   3.3             Electricity at Work Regulations (EAWR)
                                   3.3.1           The need for appropriate                 inspection    and testing
                                   Regulation 4(2) of t h e EAWR requires that:


                                  As may b e necessary to prevent danger, all systems shall b e maintained                        so as to
                                  prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, such danger.


                                  HSR25, which provides guidance o n these regulations, advises that this regulation
                                  is concerned with t h e need for maintenance to ensure the safety of the system,
                                  rather than with the activity of carrying out t h e maintenance in a safe manner, which
                                  is required by Regulation 4(3). The obligation to maintain a system arises if danger
                                  would otherwise result. There is n o specific requirement                   to carry out a maintenance
                                  activity as such; what is required is that the system is kept in a safe condition. The
                                  frequency and nature of the maintenance                       must be such as to prevent danger so far
                                  as is reasonably practicable.


                                  There have been many debates as to what 'reasonably practicable' means. In the
                                  event of an accident, i t would b e for a court to decide the issues. In essence, however,
                                  the reduction of risk to as low as is reasonably practicable means weighing that risk
                                  against the sacrifice needed t o further reduce it. The decision should b e weighted in
                                  favour of health and safety, because the presumption                     is that t h e duty holder should
                                  implement             t h e risk reduction measure. To avoid having to make this sacrifice, the duty
                                  holder must b e able to show that it would b e grossly disproportionate                  to the benefits
                                  of risk reduction that would b e achieved. Thus the process is not one of balancing t h e
                                  costs and benefits of measures, b u t rather, of adopting measures except where they
                                  are ruled o u t because they involve grossly disproportionate sacrifices.


                                  Ultimately, under t h e EAWRit is the duty holder who is responsible for t h e safety of an
                                  electrical installation at work. This leads to the question as to w h o the duty holder is.
                                  In Section 4 of the Health a n d Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA), reference is m a d e
                                  to a person "who has, t o any extent, control of premises". This may b e an identified
                                  person with that specific responsibility                 within an organization, such as a landlord, or
                                  perhaps a manager or supervisor.


                                  Regular inspection of equipment, including the electrical installation, is a n essential
                                  part of any preventative                   maintenance   programme.    This regular inspection may b e
                                  carried out as necessary without dismantling (or with partial dismantling, as required)
                                  a n d supplemented                  by appropriate testing.

        Safety issues i n general are outlined                    i n S e c t i o n 1. When carryingout periodic inspection                            and
        testing, the inspector             is advised to include the following                        considerations          when developing
        risk assessments,             a n d test a n d inspection             procedures             for a particular installation:

                                  Information               on the requirements   for routine   checks and inspections should b e
                                  provided in accordance with Section 6 of t h e HSWA 1974 and as required by t h e
                                  CDM Regulations. Dutyholders and users of premises should seek this information as
                                  the basis on which to make their own assessments. The HSE advises in HSR25 that
                                  practical experience of an installation's use may indicate the need for an adjustment to
                                  the frequency of checks and inspections. This is a matter of judgement for the dutyholder.


                                  BS 7 6 7 1 requires t h e designer of a n electrical installation to recommend t h e interval
                                  to t h e first periodic inspection and insert the date of that recommendation o n t h e E1C.
                                  However, as stated in Regulation 341 .1, wider consideration             should b e given to the
                                  expected maintainability of a n installation, and t h e client, and perhaps t h e installer,
                                  should also b e involved, with t h e designer taking t h e advice of other relevant persons
                                  into account. After the first, and further periodic inspections          a n d tests, the inspector,
                                  in conjunction with t h e client, taking into account the test results and the observations
                                  found, will then advise on t h e period until the next inspection. Whatever inspection
                                  and testing periods are decided u p o n must b e justifiable, as they may b e requested to
                                  b e justified in t h e case of an accident or similar. It would not b e unreasonable for the
                                  inspector to write supporting reasons for the period onto the inspection and test report.


                                  3.5              Routine         checks
                                  Electrical installations should n o t b e left without any attention for t h e periods of years
                                  that are normally allowed between formal inspections. In domestic premises, it is
                                  presumed that the occupier will soon notice any breakages or excessive wear and
                                  arrange for precautions t o b e taken and repairs to b e carried out.


                                  Commercial and industrial installations come under the EAWR. For these installations,
                                  formal arrangements are required for maintenance and interim routine checks (as well
                                  as for periodic inspections); there should also b e the facility to receive wear-and-tear
                                  reports f r o m users of the premises.


                                  The frequency and t y p e of these routine checks will depend entirely u p o n the nature
                                  of the premises and should b e set by the electrical dutyholder. Routine checks should
                                  include t h e items listed in Table 3.1. Table 3.2 ( i n Section 3.7) provides guidance o n
                                  the frequency for initial interval between inspections, which m a y need to b e increased
                                  as an installation ages.

                                              (b)     wear/deterioration

                                              (a)     switchgear accessible (not obstructed)
                                              (b)     doors of enclosures secure
                                              (c)     adequate labelling in place

                                              (a)     switchgear (where reasonable)

                                              (c)     including RCDs (using test button)


       Note that routine checks need not b e carried out by an electrically skilled person,
       but should b e undertaken by somebody who is able to safely use t h e installation and
       recognize defects.


       There is a general ongoing requirement          to manage health and safety at work, and
       electrical safety is just one area of this. To ensure that regular routine checks are m a d e
       o n the electrical installation, it may b e advantageous in larger premises to combine
       these with other regular checks, such as emergency lighting a n d fire alarm inspections,
       general fire safety inspections, emergency exit route inspections, and so on, o n security
       patrols. A system to record obvious defects should b e implemented and a simple f o r m
       is all that is needed.



       3.6         Required information
       It is essential that t h e inspector knows and agrees with the client the extent of t h e
       installation to b e inspected and any criteria regarding t h e limit of t h e inspection. This
       should b e recorded.


514.9 Enquiries should b e m a d e to t h e person responsible for the electrical installation with
      regard to t h e provision of diagrams, design criteria, type of electricity supply (and any
       alternative supply) and earthing arrangements.


       Where they exist, diagrams, charts or tables should b e m a d e available to indicate t h e
       type and composition of circuits and t h e identification of protective devices for shock
       protection,   isolation and switching, with a description         of the method         used for fault
       protection. Unfortunately, most such records are not kept up-to-date w i t h modifications
       made to the installation, and an inspector will initially need to verify the accuracy of
       any such information provided.


       Where there are n o records, in all but t h e simplest domestic installation, a n inspector
       may first need to spend t i m e tracing installation systems and circuits and producing
       basic drawings and schedules, before starting any inspection and testing work.

                          3.7         Frequency of periodic inspections
               644.4      The t i m e intervals between t h e recommended dates of periodic inspections and
               653.4      testing require careful consideration. The date for t h e first periodic inspection and test
                          is required to b e considered and recommended by the installation designer, based o n
                          their design philosophy and maintenance advice f r o m other parties (Regulation 341.1).
                          The period for each subsequent periodic inspection is required to b e considered and
                          recommended by the inspector as part of carrying out a periodic inspection a n d test.
                          Regulations 644.4 and 653.4 requires the reason for selecting the interval between
                          the current inspection          and the next periodic inspection   to b e recorded on the EIC,
                          MEIWC o r EICR as relevant.


                652.1     In advising the person ordering t h e work about t h e t i m e interval for t h e period for t h e
                          next recommended periodic inspection and test, t h e inspector is required to take into
                          consideration t h e individual characteristics of t h e type of installation and equipment, its
                          condition, use and operation, any damage and deterioration, any known maintenance
                          and t h e external influences to which it is subjected. The results and recommendations
                          of any previous periodic inspection reports should also b e considered.


                          The suggested initial frequencies for inspection and testing given in Table 3.2 are
                          recommendations              and not legal requirements.    The period   between    subsequent
                          inspections may b e reduced, o r occasionally increased. It is the responsibility of the
                          person responsible for the electrical installation to determine when the next periodic
                          inspection is undertaken. In making this decision, they should take appropriate advice
                          f r o m specialists, where necessary, t o assessthe conditions affecting t h e installation that
                          might lead to defects, potential damage and/or deterioration that would affect safety.
                          Such advice m a y include routine checks, manufacturers'             o r engineers' advice and
                          guidance, and periodic inspection and testing reports, with this information            assisting
                          the person responsible for t h e electrical installation in determining t h e maintenance
                          plan for t h e installation. Over time, and with practical maintenance experience, it may
                          b e possible to extend periodic inspection and testing intervals if t h e results of routine
                          checks, inspections or tests show that few faults are found and that t h e installation
                          is not subject to excessive deterioration. However, if faults are common, it may b e
                          necessary t o reduce intervals or take other action to improve maintenance and reduce
                          risk. Routine checks and periodic inspection and testing by an inspector are only a
                          part of the requirement           for maintenance;   t h e person responsible for the electrical
                          installation has a continuing ongoing responsibility for the safety of an installation.


                          Note:       Persons responsible for electrical installations are reminded of the requirements of
                                      Regulation 4(2) of the EAWR. Undertaking routine inspection and testing of their
                                      installationswill assist in meeting this duty.


                          The inspector, being a skilled person, should apply sound engineering                judgement
                          and experience w h e n deciding u p o n t h e intervals between inspecting and testing
                          an installation based u p o n t h e criteria in Regulation 6 5 2 of BS 7671. It must also b e
                          noted that in the event of an accident or dangerous occurrence, t h e inspector may b e
                          required to justify their decision.


                          In t h e case of domestic and commercial premises,             a change i n occupancy of the
                          premises may necessitate additional inspection and testing.

651.1 The formal periodic inspection and testing should b e carried out in accordance with
      Regulation 642, supplemented by tests as detailed in Regulation 643. This requires
        an inspection comprising a detailed examination of the installation, carried o u t without
        dismantling, or with partial dismantling as required, together with the appropriate tests
        of Regulation 643 as required to comply with Regulation 651.2.


652.2   Where there is an effective management system in place for inspection and preventative
        maintenance of the installation (for example, where there are competent permanent
        on-site maintenance staff), periodic inspection and testing can b e replaced by an
        adequate regime of continuous monitoring and maintenance of the installation and its
        constituent    equipment.    However, appropriate records must b e maintained                     o n site to
        show that a n inspection and preventative maintenance plan is in place and is being
        adhered to.


        Although periodic inspection          a n d testing is primarily aimed at keeping an electrical
        installation in a safe state, it can also have other financial benefits, such as identifying
        possible upcoming equipment failures that could interrupt production, providing advice
        o n energy saving, a n d reducing running costs. It must also b e noted that while this
        Guidance Note is concerned with periodic inspection and testing for t h e maintenance
        of safety of general electrical installations, there are other specialist parts of an electrical
        installation, such as plant controls, fire alarms and emergency lighting, that also require
        separate periodic inspection and testing by specialists for t h e maintenance of safety.

8    The person carrying out subsequent inspections may recommend that the interval between
     future inspections be increased or decreased as a result of the findings of their inspection.
9    Medical locations shall have their isolating transformer equipment inspected and tested
     for functionality, as well as alarms, etc. Every third year the output leakage current of the
     IT isolating equipment shall be measured. Measurements to verify that the resistance
     of the supplementary equipotential bonding is within the limits stipulated by Regulation
     710.415.2.2 should be carried out annually. In addition, in Group 2 Medical locations
     complete functional tests of the insulation monitoring devices (IMDs) associated with
     the medical IT system including insulation failure, transformer high temperature,
     overload, discontinuity and the audible/visual alarms linked to them should be
     conducted annually.
10   The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 requires that properties under the Act have their
     services maintained. Periodic inspection and testing is the lET's recognized method of
     demonstrating this.
1H   The Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations and the
     Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (Wales) Regulations.
12   The Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations 2020
     requires landlords in the private rented sector in England to have a rental property
     inspected and tested every five years and supply a copy of the report to the tenant
     within 28 days. Any remedial works or further investigation must be completed within
     2 8 days, and confirmation provided in writing to the tenant, and local authority if
     required, within 28 days of completion of this work. There are similar requirements in all
     devolved nations, and guidance is available on the relevant Government website.
13   Mobile and transportable units should be inspected and tested at least every
     12 months. Mobile and transportable units that are connected to an independent source
     of electricity at site should be inspected and tested on connection. In use, mobile and
     transportable units should be at periods suitable for the environment in which it is
     being used, for example every three months in a construction site environment, up to a
     maximum of 12 months between inspection and testing.


Any landlord (of an H M O or other occupancy) may b e considered to have duties under
the EAWRdue to their responsibilities under Section 3 of t h e HSWA 1974 (relating, for
example, to the c o m m o n areas of a set of flats). In Scotland, the private rented sector
has legal requirements to maintain the electrical installation. Landlords are required by
law to ensure that the electrical installation in a rented property is safe w h e n tenants
m o v e in and is maintained in a safe condition throughout its duration and that an H M O
has a periodic inspection carried o u t o n the property every five years.


(The definition of a H M O is difficult, but it hinges o n whether the persons living i n
the house are related - as in a large family residence - or completely separate, as in
a block of flats.)



3.8      Requirements for periodic inspection and testing
3.8.1     Process: prior to carrying            out inspection      and testing
Prior to carryingout t h e inspection, the inspector will need to meet with the client o r
the client's representative to agree the scope a n d nature of t h e work required and the
programme and to highlight likely items that require isolation.


Consultation    with   t h e client   or t h e client's representative     prior to t h e periodic
inspection and testing work being carried out is essential t o determine the access and
any disruption to the normal work in the premises. The inspector will also n e e d to
ascertain, and b e appraised of, particular health and safety requirements             (as dangerous
processes may b e being carried out), security and access and fire safety requirements,
a n d to determine     the degree of electrical disconnection that will b e acceptable. To
assist with the planning of the detailed inspection and testing, any existing drawings,
schedules and documentation of t h e installation should b e available; some initial




                                                                              Guidance Note 3: Inspection & Testing        117
                                                                         © The Institution of Engineering and Technology
 3
                           validation of these will b e necessary. In addition, the extent of previous maintenance
                           a n d routine tests, along with documentation including t h e original design a n d E I C , a n d
                           certificates for any other electrical works that have b e e n carried out in the premises, if
                           available, should b e provided to the inspector.


                           For safety, it is necessary to carry out a visual inspection of t h e installation before
                           testing or opening enclosures, removing covers, etc. So far as is reasonably practicable,
                           t h e visual inspection must verify that the safety of persons, livestock and property is
                           not endangered.


                           3.8.2      General           procedure
                           Note:       The following advice is not applicable to domestic or simple installations, as the extent
                                       and method of inspection and testing is rudimentary in such installations compared
                                       with more complex installations.


                          Although there are various approaches to carrying out inspection and testing, one
                           suggested method              is to first obtain an overview   of the installation, ideally f r o m
                          diagrams a n d charts, as well as from a simple 'walk-round' survey prior to starting the
                          full inspection. This will enable the inspector to b e able to plan the inspection and to
                          identify items that require isolation, etc. M o s t importantly, this initial survey will enable
                          the inspector to set sample sizes, (see Section 3.8.3).


                651.1     Where diagrams, charts or tables are not available, a degree of exploratory work may
                          b e necessary so that inspection and testing can be carried out safely and effectively;
                          this may include a survey to identify switchgear, controlgear and the circuits they control.


                          Indeed, for m o r e involved installations without design information,          such as, diagrams
                          or charts, t h e client should b e advised that such diagrams require producing in order
                          to plan and conduct the inspection and testing. Alternatively, where the inspector
                          considers that it is safe to proceed, the inspection can commence, but may b e limited to
                          visual inspection. The production of diagrams and charts can be called for on the EICR.


                651.2     Note should b e m a d e of any k n o w n changes in environmental conditions or building
                          structure, and of any additions or alterations. The inspector may need to consider
                          whether such changes have affected t h e suitability of wiring systems and other
                          equipment f o r t h e i r present load, location, and m e t h o d of installation.


                          During t h e inspection, opportunity should b e taken to identify dangers that might arise
                          during t h e testing. Any location and equipment          for which safety precautions may b e
                          necessary should b e noted and the appropriate steps taken.


                          A thorough inspection should b e made of all electrical equipment that is not concealed,
                          and should include the accessible internal condition of a sample of the equipment.
                          The external condition should b e noted and, if damage is identified or if the degree of
                          protection has been impaired, this should b e recorded o n t h e Schedule of Inspections
                          appended to the Report. The inspection should include a check o n t h e condition                  of
                          electrical equipment and material, taking into account any available manufacturer's
                          information, with regard to the following:


                          (a) safety;
                          (b) age;
                          (c) damage and defects;

                          It should b e noted that the initial sample size is based only o n a visual pre-inspection
                          and consultation of records. Further, what may at first appear to b e good, for example,
                          the quality of maintenance, may turn o u t to b e poor during the detailed inspection
                          and testing.


                          In determining       the sample size, it should b e noted that the minimum       population   size
                          to get meaningful         results is 1 0 0 according to statistical sampling theory. That means
                          that inspection and testing as a whole, should cover at least 100 points on electrical
                          equipment.       The term electrical equipment     is defined in BS 7671 as follows:


                          El lectrica! e q u i p m e n t ( a b b r : Equipment). Any item for such purposes as generation,
                          conversion, transmission, distribution o r utilization of electrical energy, such as
                          machines, transformers, apparatus, measuring instruments, protective devices, wiring
                          systems, accessories, appliances and luminaires.


                          For very small installations such as those in some domestic premises, this principle is
                          likely to m e a n that most electrical equipment       forming part of the fixed installation is
                          inspected a n d tested as appropriate. For example, a small domestic installation may
                          only have four circuits each with less than ten accessories connected; t h e total number
                          of items of electrical equipment, including the consumer unit and circuit wiring, is likely
                          to b e well under 100, and, because it is practicable, all items are likely to b e included
                          in the inspection and test. There should certainly b e n o sample of circuits made in
                          such premises.


                          In larger installations, such as those in commercial             or industrial   premises,    it is
                          recommended to change t h e sample to b e inspected and/or tested between periodic
                          inspection and test visits. To facilitate this, the specific equipment     sampled should b e
                          clearly identified in t h e records. If this is not done, due t o large population sizes f r o m
                          which samples are taken, it is possible that some parts of t h e installation would rarely,
                          if ever, b e inspected and/or tested.

        final report




Where the inspection or testing of a sample yields poor or unacceptable results, this
would suggest that similar problems might exist elsewhere in uninspected or untested
items. The inspector will t h e n need either to increase the sampling or refer back to
the client; it may b e that the inspector recommends that 100 °/otesting is carried o u t
in that area.


The principle of this is indicated in Figure 3.1.




                                                                                      G u i d a n c e N o t e 3: Inspection   & Testing   121
                                                                                © The Institution   of Engineering     and Technology
                          As an example, consider the testing of final circuits at a distribution board with a
                          sample size of 10 7o of the lighting circuits. Suppose that more than one of these
                          circuits was found to have an unacceptably high earth fault loop impedance (EFLI),
                          with a relatively low EFLIatthe incoming terminals to the distribution board itself, and
                          that there were no apparent factors to suggest why the final circuit values were high.
                          It would be remiss to complete the EICRby using just this 10 7o sample and stating
                          that improvements were required for these circuits. It would be far more appropriate
                          to increase the sample size or to recommend that all circuits at the distribution board
                          were tested, based on the initial findings.

                          If relatively small sample sizes are chosen, it is important that these are representative
                          of the complete installation. Similarly, if a repeat periodic inspection is undertaken
                          using a sampling system, then a different sample, again representative of the complete
                          installation, must be chosen. Therefore, previous periodic inspection and test records
                          should be consulted prior to commencement of a sample inspection and test.
                          Suggested sample sizes for visual inspections are provided in Table 3.3; suggested
                          sample sizes for testing are discussed in Section 3.10.1 of this Guidance Note and in
                          Table 3.4.

                          Notes:
                          1  Where t h e inspection o f a sample yields p o o r or unacceptable results, this w o u l d
                             suggest that similar problems m a y exist elsewhere i n t h e uninspected items. T h e
                             inspector will n e e d either t o increase t h e sampling or refer back t o t h e client; it m a y b e
                                  that t h e inspector r e c o m m e n d s that 1 0 0 % inspection is carried o u t i n that area.
                          2       1 0 0 % where practicable.
                          3       Generally, it is less appropriate to apply small sample sizing to the inspection of
                                  socket-outlets compared w i t h samples for lighting, as i t is m o r e likely that user
                                  e q u i p m e n t will b e hand-held presenting a greater risk for potential electric shock.
                          4       D o not 'sample samples', resulting in a very l o w overall sampled installation. Samples
                                  m u s t b e representative. If i t is decided t o sample, for example, sub-main cables at
                                  10 7o,then further sampling should not b e applied to t h e final circuit distribution boards
                                  o n these circuits.
                          5       One easy way t o remember sampling is to reflect o n the fact that where just 1 0 % of final
                                  circuits have b e e n inspected, this actually means that 9 0 % have not b e e n inspected.

        Whenever samples are taken, and whatever sample size is utilized, the inspector must
        remember     that t h e requirement   of the Report is to say whether or not t h e electrical
        installation being inspected     (subject t o any agreed limitations)    is suitable or not for
        continued use. The inspector m u s t carry out sufficient inspection and testing to allow
        t h e m to make that judgement, i n many dwellings and smaller commercial installations,
        sampling would b e largely inappropriate and should never o m i t entire circuits.


        3.9       Periodic inspection

        3.9.1 Example checklist of items that require inspection
Appx6   The following is a copy of the checklist in Appendix 6 of BS 7671, which lists items at
        various locations within a n installation that may require inspection. The items in this
        checklist are examples; t h e list is not exhaustive.


         ELECTRICAL INTAKE EQUIPMENT               (VISUAL INSPECTION           ONLY)
         Where inadequacies in intake equipment         are encountered,   it is recommended         that
        the person ordering t h e report informs the appropriate authority.
        •     Service cable
        •     Service head
        •     Earthing arrangements (where provided, for example TN-C-S and TN-S
              systems, b u t not TT systems)
        •     Meter tails (on both supplier and consumer side of the meter)
        •     Metering equipment
        •     Isolator (where present)
        Note:      It is important for the inspector to provide information about inadequacies with
                   electrical intake equipment, along with any recommendation to inform the relevant
                   authority, to the person ordering the report, in writing to cover liability.

        ALTERNATIVE SOURCES
        •     Adequate arrangements where a generating set operates as a switched
              alternative to t h e public supply (551.6)
        •     Adequate arrangements where a generating set operates in parallel with t h e
              public supply (551.7)
        AUTOMATIC        DISCONNECTION         OF SUPPLY
        •     Main earthing bonding arrangements (411.3; Chap 54)
              1   Presence of distributor's earthing arrangement (542.1.2.1; 542.1.2.2), or
                  presence of installation earth electrode arrangement (542.1.2.3)
              2   Adequacy of earthing conductor size (542.3; 543.1.1)
              3   Adequacy of earthing conductor connections (542.3.2)
              4   Accessibility of earthing conductor connections (543.3.2)
              5   Adequacy of main protective bonding conductor sizes (544.1)
              6   Adequacy and location of m a i n protective bonding conductor connections
                  (543.3.2;   544.1.2)
              7   Accessibility of all protective bonding connections (543.3.2)

                                                                                                                        3

Incorporated components            inside the assembly can be f r o m different manufacturers.
It is essential that all incorporated components have their compatibility for the
final enclosed arrangements verified by t h e original manufacturer            of the assembly
and are assembled i n accordance with their instructions, for example, those of the
consumer       unit or distribution      board manufacturer.   The original manufacturer is
t h e organization that carried out t h e original design and t h e associated verification
of the LV switchgear and controlgear assembly to the relevant part of the BS EN
61439 series. If an assembly deviates from its original manufacturer's instructions, or
includes components n o t included in t h e original verification, the person introducing
the deviation becomes the original manufacturer, with the corresponding obligations.
The inspector may wish to note such assemblies for further investigation.
Consumer unit standards have also evolved over the years to provide co-ordinated
'conditional ratings'.
       1   BS 5486-13: 1979 had a 6 kA, 10 kA, o r 16 kA conditional rating as part
           of a British Standard. The inspector therefore needs to check t h e label or
           instructions for CM6, CM10 or CM16.
      2    BS 5486-13: 1989 had a 16 kA conditional rating as part of a British
           Standard. BS 5486-13 was withdrawn and replaced by B S E N 60439-3: 1991.
      3    BS EN 60439-3: 1991 had UK National deviation Annex ZA 16 kA
           conditional rating. B S E N 60439-3:      1991 was withdrawn and replaced by
           BS EN 60439-3: 2012.
      4    BS EN 61439-3: 2012 has UK National deviation Annex ZB 16 kA
           conditional rating.
      5    BS EN 61439-3: 2012 (incorporating          corrigenda   September 2013 a n d
           December      2015) is the only current version for new installations, but the
           older equipment may still b e in use in installations.

                                             inspections applied.

                                     additional inspection schedule               ) should b e provided on separate pages.


                                   3.10 Periodic testing
                                   3.10.1           General

                      651.1 The periodic testing is supplementary to the inspection of the installation: see Section 3.8.1.

                                   The same range and level of testing as for initial testing is not necessarily required, or
                                   indeed possible, installations that have been previously tested and for which there are
                                   comprehensive records of test results may not need the same degree of testing as
                                   installations for which n o such records exist.


                     651.5 Periodic testing may cause danger if t h e correct procedures are not applied. Persons
                           carrying out periodic testing must b e competent in the use of t h e instruments
                           employed and have adequate knowledge and experience of the t y p e of installation
                                   (see Section 3.8.1).


                                  The inspector will n e e d t o set a sample size for testing. Notes o n the principle of this
                                   are included in Section 3.8.3, which should b e studied together with the guidance o n
                                  suggested tests in Table 3.4.


                                  Where a sample test indicates results significantly different                   f r o m those previously
                                   recorded, further investigation is necessary. In addition, if during t h e course of testing
                                   a sample, significant errors are found that suggest that the same problems might exist
                                  in untested items, the inspector should take appropriate action by either increasing
                                  the sampling or by referring back to the client regarding t h e matter; it may b e that the
                                  inspector recommends                 that 100 °/otesting is carried out in that area. This principle is
                                  mentioned earlier, in Figure 3.1.


                                  3.10.2           Tests to be made

                     651.2 The tests considered appropriate by t h e person carrying out the inspection should
                           b e carried out in accordance with t h e recommendations in Table 3.4 a n d considering
                                  Section 3.8.1 to 3.8.3 of this Guidance Note.


                                  See Section 2.6 of this Guidance Note for test methods, noting that alternative methods
                                  m a y b e used, provided they give reliable results.

Notes:
1 The person carrying out t h e testing should decide which of the above tests are appropriate
    by using their experience and knowledge of t h e installation being inspected and tested and
    by consulting any available records (see Section 3.8.3 of this Guidance Note).
2   Where sampling is applied, t h e percentage u s e d is at t h e discretion of t h e inspector
    (see Section 3.8.3 of this Guidance Note). A percentage of less t h a n 1 0 7o, or sampling
    i n installations w i t h a sample population of less than 1 0 0 items of electrical equipment,
    is inadvisable.

4   T h e EFLI test m a y b e used to confirm t h e continuity o f protective conductors at
    socket-outlets and, w h e r e it is safe to d o so, at accessible exposed-conductive-parts of
    current-using e q u i p m e n t a n d accessories.
5   Generally, accessibility m a y b e considered t o b e within 3 m f r o m t h e floor or f r o m
    w h e r e a person can stand.
6   Where t h e circuit includes SPDs or other electronic devices that require a connection
    to earth for functional purposes, these devices will require disconnecting t o avoid
    influencing t h e test result and t o prevent t h e m being damaged.
7   Where an installation is fully loaded and the conductors are at their normal operating
    temperatures, measured loop impedance values can b e directly compared with the
    maximum values of EFLI set out in the tables in Chapter 41 of the Regulations. Loop
    impedance data for unloaded conductors at 20 °C can b e found in t h e lET's On-Site Guide.

                           8  Except at the origin of t h e installation, EFLI may b e determined by means other than
                              measurement (see Section 2.6.15).

                          1 0 In some installations, it i s not always practicable to isolate the supply to certain parts of
                                 the installation for t h e purposes of frequent periodic inspection a n d testing, for example
                                 those supplying safety services. In these circumstances, s o m e information regarding t h e
                                 state of insulation may b e obtained using a leakage current clamp meter (sometimes
                                 called 'tong tester') - see Appendix C .

Notes:
1 The person carrying out the testing should decide which of the above tests are appropriate
       by using their experience and knowledge of t h e installation being inspected and tested and
       by consulting any available records (see Section 3.8.3 of this Guidance Note).
2      Where sampling is applied, t h e percentage used is at t h e discretion of t h e inspector
       (see Section 3.8.3 of this Guidance Note). A percentage of less than 10 7o, or sampling
       in installations w i t h a sample population of less than 1 0 0 items of electrical equipment,
       is inadvisable.

                          8   Except at the origin of the installation, EFLI may be determined by means other than
                              measurement (see Section 2.6.15).
                          9 See Section 2.6.24 where EFLI is to be determined in installations with inverter supplies,
                              such as PEIs.
                          1 0 In some installations, it is not always practicable to isolate the supply to certain parts of
                              the installation for the purposes of frequent periodic inspection and testing, for example
                              those supplying safety services. In these circumstances, some information regarding the
                              state of insulation may be obtained using a leakage current clamp meter (sometimes
                              called 'tong tester') - see Appendix C.


                          3.10.3 Additional notes on periodic testing
                          This section provides s o m e notes o n t h e practicalities of carrying o u t the periodic tests,
                          particularly within an installation where only partial isolation is practicable.


                          a      Continuity of protective earthing and bonding conductors, and
                                 EFLItesting
                          If an electrical installation is isolated from t h e supply, it is permissible to disconnect
                          protective earthing and bonding conductors from the main earthing terminal (MET) in
                          order to verify their continuity.


                          Where it is not practicable to isolate an electrical installation from t h e supply at t h e
                          t i m e of the inspection and testing works, t h e protective earthing or bonding conductors
                          should not b e disconnected as, under fault conditions, t h e exposed-conductive-parts
                          and extraneous-conductive-parts could b e raised to a dangerous voltage relative to
                          Earth potential. In addition, the measurement of EFLI at various parts of the installation is, for
                          practical reasons, carried out with the protective earthing and bonding conductors connected.


                          A convenient way to carry o u t t h e above periodic tests i n a large installation could b e
                          to use the wandering lead m e t h o d to test continuity (see Section 2.6.5, test method
                          2), noting that t h e conductors were not disconnected for these tests, and to directly
                          measure EFLI at t h e same time. With t h e earthing and bonding conductors connected,
                          t h e tests confirm connection, but not t h e continuity of the conductors involved.


                          Motor circuits
                          Loop impedance tests o n motor circuits can only b e carried o u t o n the supply side of
                          isolated motor controlgear. A continuity test between t h e circuit protective conductor
                          (cpc) and the motor is t h e n necessary.


                          b      Insulation resistance
                          Insulation resistance tests should b e m a d e o n electrically isolated circuits with any
                          electronic    equipment       that might   b e damaged by application of the test voltage
                          disconnected, or only a measurementto protective earth made, with t h e live conductors
                          connected together.          It is advised to disconnect functional earth connections to
                          residual current devices (RCDs) and residual current circuit-breakers (with overcurrent
                          protection)    (RCBOs) w h e n carrying out insulation resistance tests, as it may otherwise
                          influence t h e results.


               643.3     For most installations, t h e most practical test is an insulation resistance test between
                         live conductors (connected together) and earth; i n practice, t i m e does not usually
                         allow for a line to neutral test. Where equipment is installed that may be susceptible
                         to damage by a 5 0 0 V DC test voltage, such as electronic control and monitoring
                         devices, Regulation 643.3 states that t h e test should b e conducted with a test voltage
                         of 2 5 0 V DC.

         Check that information/warnings        are given at the distribution       board of circuits o r
         equipment likely t o b e damaged by testing. Any diagram, chart or table should also
         include this warning.


         The results of insulation testing should b e compared with previous results, where
         possible. Table 2.8 of this Guidance Note (Table 6 4 of BS7671) requires a minimum
         insulation resistance of 1 M Q , but strictly speaking, this value applies only to initial
         verification. It can, however, be used as a guide for periodic testing. Such low insulation
         resistancereadingsmay indicate that there isa problem with an item of electrical equipment,
         and where possible past records should be reviewed to identify historical readings to
         determine if there has been a sudden, or gradual, decrease, from previous tests.


         Where equipment      is disconnected     for these tests and the equipment           has exposed-
         conductive-parts required by t h e Regulations to b e connected to protective conductors,
         the insulation resistance between t h e exposed-conductive-parts and all live parts of the
         equipment should b e measured separately and ought to comply with the requirements
         of the appropriate British Standard for t h e equipment.


         There is a range of possible outcomes when carrying out insulation testing. Tests are
         typically made between all live conductors connected together and Earth at a test
         voltage of 5 0 0 V DC.


         The inspector will need to measure the values of insulation resistance for a given
         distribution   board and then take a view based o n their engineering judgement as to
         whether the results obtained are acceptable. It should b e noted that distribution boards
         with large numbers of final circuits will generally give a lower insulation resistance value
         than distribution boards with fewer final circuits.


         c     Polarity
         It should b e established whether there have been any additions or alterations to the
         installation since its last inspection. If no additions or alterations have been made, the
         polarity test may n o t b e necessary.


         d     Operation of overcurrent circuit-breakers
643.10   Where protection against overcurrent is provided by circuit-breakers, the manual
         operating mechanism of each circuit-breaker should b e operated to verify that t h e
         device opens and closes satisfactorily.


         It is n o t normally necessary or practicable to test the operation of the automatic
         tripping mechanism      of circuit-breakers. A test would n e e d to b e made at a current
         substantially exceeding t h e m i n i m u m tripping current in order to achieve operation
         within a reasonable time. For circuit-breakers to BS EN 6 0 8 9 8 , a test current of not
         less than two and a half times the rated tripping current of the device is needed for
         operation within o n e minute, and m u c h larger test currents would b e necessary to
         verify operation of the mechanism for instantaneous tripping.


         If there is doubt about the integrity of the automatic mechanism for circuit-breakers of
         t h e sealed type, designed n o t to b e maintained, it will normally b e m o r e practicable to
         replace the device than to make further tests. Such doubt may arisefrom visual inspection,
         if the device appears to have suffered damage or undue deterioration, or where there is
         evidence that the device may have failed t o operate satisfactorily in service.


         Circuit-breakers with the facility for injection testing may b e so tested and, if appropriate,
         their relay settings confirmed.



                                                                                    Guidance Note 3 : Inspection & Testing        131

                           e      Operation of devices for isolation and switching
                           Where means are provided i n accordance with t h e requirements of t h e Regulations
                           for isolation and switching, the devices should b e operated to verify their effectiveness
                           and checked to ensure adequate and correct labelling.


                           It should b e verified by inspection that easy access to such devices is maintained and
                          that effective operation is not impaired by any material placed near the device. Access
                           and operation areas may b e required to b e marked to ensure they are kept clear.


                           For isolating devices in which the position of the contacts o r other means of isolation is
                          externally visible, visual inspection of operation is sufficient and n o testing is required.


                          The operation of every safety switching device should b e checked by operating t h e
                          device in t h e manner normally intended, t o confirm that it performs its function
                          correctly in accordance with t h e requirements of BS 7671.


                          Where it is a requirement      that the device interrupts all t h e supply conductors,       the
                          use of a proprietary test lamp, or two-pole voltage detector connected between each
                          line and t h e neutral on the load side of the switching device, is essential to confirm
                          isolation. Reliance should not b e placed o n a simple observation that the equipment
                          controlled has ceased to operate.


                          Where switching devices are provided with detachable or lockable handles in accordance
                          with the Regulations, a check should b e made to verify that the handles or keys are n o t
                          interchangeable with any others available within the premises.


              643.10      Where any f o r m of interlocking is provided, such as between a main circuit-breaker
                          and a n outgoing switch or isolation device, the integrity of t h e interlocking must b e
                          verified; this may b e beyond the scope of the inspector and something that is referred
                          to a manufacturer or specialist.


                          Where switching devices are provided for isolation or for mechanical              maintenance

        On completion      of periodic inspection      and testing, the EICR and its accompanying
        schedules must b e given to the client or person who ordered the inspection.


        A very important point to remember is that any damage, deterioration, defects,
        dangerous conditions and non-compliance with B S 7 6 7 1 that may give rise to danger
        (’danger' being a risk of injury to persons or livestock) must b e recorded o n the Report.


        Classification codes C l to C3 indicate danger and non-compliances                    with BS 7671;
        these are explained in Table 3.5.


        Each separate item entered in the Section K 'Observations'              section of t h e Report
        should b e coded C l , C 2 or C3 as appropriate, or, exceptionally, Fl (see Table 3.5). Only
        one classification code is to b e recorded against each observation.


        Where an installation defect or non-compliance with the Regulations has attracted a
        code of C l , C 2 or Fl, t h e overall assessment of the Report must b e 'unsatisfactory'.

3.12 Periodic inspection of installations constructed
     to an earlier edition of BS7671 or the lEEWiring
     Regulations
People often ask what standard should b e applied w h e n carrying o u t t h e periodic
inspection   of a n installation   constructed   in accordance with an earlier edition            of
BS 7671, or an even earlier edition of t h e lEEWiring Regulations, or to an unknown
standard. Each edition of the Wiring Regulations has provided for an increase in
safety to the users of installations. Some installation practices and methods that were
compliant with earlier editions would n o w b e considered unacceptable or dangerous,
such as the use o f a public water pipe as a means of earthing.


In all cases, t h e inspection should b e carried o u t against the current edition of BS7671 .
It is likely that there will b e items that d o not comply with that edition, but this does
n o t necessarily m e a n that t h e installation is unsafe. If the inspector considers that an
item, although not warranting code C l or C2, requires improvement, it should b e given
code C3 o n the EICR. If the item does not require improvement,           it may b e recorded
as an observation but it does not warrant a classification code.


Reference is made to existing installations both in the second paragraph of the
Introductions to BS 7 6 7 1 and its amendments, and in the Note by the HSEthat follows
the Preface to BS 7671.

  4.1      Instrument standard
  BS EN 61010 Safety requirements      for electrical equipment    for measurement,                control,
  and laboratory use is the basic safety standard for electrical test instruments.


  The series of standards to which electrical test equipment      for verification of measures
  for protection against electric shock is BS EN 61557 Electrical safety in low voltage
  distribution systems up to 1000 1/ a.c. and 1500 1/ d.c. Equipment for testing,
  measuring or monitoring of protective measures. This standard includes performance
  requirements    and requires compliance with BS EN 61010.


  In Section 1.1 of this Guidance Note, reference was made to the use of test leads
  conforming     to HSEGS38. The HSE always advise only to carry out live tests that are
  actually useful and informative, so as to minimize danger; the inspector should always
  consider whether any particular live test is necessary before undertaking it. The safety
  measures and procedures set o u t in GS38 should b e observed for all instruments,
  leads, probes     and accessories. Some test instrument         manufacturers advise that
  their instruments    are used in conjunction   with fused test leads a n d probes. Other
  manufacturers advise the use of non-fused leads and probes where t h e instrument
  has in-built electrical protection, but it should b e noted that such electrical protection
  does not extend to the probes and leads.


  Appendix 14 of BS7671 also recommends          that:


     "the measurement      should always b e made on t h e output terminals of a suitably
     rated protective device. If such a device is not present then a temporary one should
     b e fitted. Measurement   should never b e made where overcurrent protection is not
     present between the point of connection and the supply transformer. Fused test
     leads alone do not meet this requirement."


  Where unsure, a risk assessment should b e carried out to establish if fused test leads
  should b e used.


  Manufacturers may provide multifunction test instruments to BS EN 61557-10 that
  combine more than one, or all, of the functions listed in Sections 4.3 to 4.8. Some of
  these instruments may have additional features such as current measurement (via clamp).

                                   The accuracy of a n e w or repaired instrument should b e established to provide a point
                                   of reference. Accuracy is usually confirmed                  by calibration, but a calibration certificate
                                   may not b e supplied with the instrument                    unless specifically requested. A certificate
                                   of conformity                 may b e provided indicating that the instrument's     accuracy was verified
                                   as part of the manufacturing                 process. Such verification follows the same procedure as
                                   calibration, but individual calibration data is n o t issued.


                                   A basic measurement accuracy of 5 7 o i s usually adequate. In the case of analogue
                                   instruments, a basic accuracy of 2 7 o o f full-scale deflection will provide the required
                                   accuracy measurement                   over a useful proportion   of the scale.


                                   It should not b e assumed that the accuracy of the reading taken in normal field use
                                   will b e as good as the basic accuracy. The ’operating accuracy’ is always worse than
                                   the basic accuracy, and additional errors derive from three sources:


                                   ( a ) instrument                 e r r o r s : basic instrument accuracy applies only in ideal conditions.
                                           The actual reading accuracy can also b e affected by:
                                           (i)     digital instruments.
                                                   Sources of error: test leads, fused leads, battery condition, ambient temperature,

                                         (ii)      analogue instruments.
                                                   Sources of error: Orientation          of the instrument    on older instruments'.    With
                                                   hand-cranked units, cranking speed, can also affect performance.
                                   (b) l o s s o f calibration:               instruments should b e periodically calibrated following
                                          manufacturer's               recommendations       and     procedures      traceable   to   National
                                          Standards. Intermediate checks can be made to ensure there are n o major errors in
                                          measurement by comparing readings with those obtained from other instruments,
                                          or by the use of a proprietary 'check box' having clearly defined characteristics.


                                  In all cases, the t y p e and frequency of recalibration or checking required should b e as
                                   specified by the instrument manufacturer. However, the user should take into account
                                  ambient environmental and usage factors, as appropriate. For example, if an instrument
                                  is left in storage at a constant temperature in a dry environment for long periods, a n d /
                                  or is used infrequently, t h e user may b e able to extend the recalibration interval.
                                  However, if an instrument is roughly handled and is regularly transported a n d stored in
                                  vehicles (and hence is subjected to fluctuations                   in temperature    and humidity caused
                                  by changes in time of day/night and time of year), then more frequent confirmation                        of
                                  accuracy would b e appropriate.


                                  Instruments should also b e subjected t o regular checks before use so that errors
                                  caused by deterioration of leads, probes, connectors, etc. d o n o t result in inaccurate
                                  readings being recorded when, for example, Schedules of Test Results are compiled.


                                  Typically, in analogue instruments,                  this corresponds to making measurements           very
                                  near to the zero point on the scale, where inaccuracies and non-repeatability                       are not
                                  at all evident with this type of electromechanical                  movement.


                                  It is essential t h a t an i n s t r u m e n t is inspected f o r damage a n d that the s a f e t y

          (c) field errors: t h e instrument reading accuracy will also b e affected by external
                influences as a result of working in the field environment.         These influences can
                take many forms. Some sources of inaccuracy are described in the appropriate
                sections of this Guidance Note.


          BS EN 61557 requires a maximum operating error of n o m o r e than ± 3 0 7 o o f reading
          over the stated measurement range, taking into account the worst-case environmental,
          supply and battery conditions.


          To achieve satisfactory in-service performance, it is essential to b e fully informed about
          the test equipment,    how it is to b e used, and the accuracy to b e expected.


          Traceability to National Standards can b e assured by using a calibration laboratory
          accredited by a National Accreditation Body. In the UK this is t h e United Kingdom
          Accreditation Service (UKAS). A list of accredited laboratories can b e found at
          www.ukas.com or a search for sources of calibration by instrument can b e made at

          4.3       Low-resistance ohmmeters
643.2.1   The continuity of conductors and connections to exposed-conductive-parts             and
          extraneous-conductive parts, if any, shall be verified by a measurement of resistance on:


          (a) protective conductors, including protective bonding conductors; and
          (b) in the case of ring final circuits, live conductors.

          The instrument used for low-resistance tests may b e either a specialized low-resistance
          ohmmeter or t h e continuity range of an insulation and continuity tester. The test current
          may b e DC or AC. It is recommended that it b e derived f r o m a source with no-load
          voltage between 4 V and 24 V and a short-circuit current of not less than 200 m A .


          The measuring range should cover the span 0.2 Q to 2 Q , with a resolution of at least
          0.01 Q for digital instruments.


          Instruments conforming to B S E N 61557-4 will meet the above requirements.


          Field effects contributing to in-service errors include probe or crock-clip contact
          resistance, test lead resistance, AC interference and thermocouple effects in mixed
          metal systems.


          Whilst contact resistance cannot b e eliminated with two-terminal testers, and can
          introduce errors, the effects of lead resistance can b e eliminated by measuring this
          prior to a test and subtracting t h e resistance f r o m t h e final value, or by using t h e test
          instrument's   'nulling' feature built in to most m o d e r n instruments.      Interference from
          an external AC source (interference        pick-up) cannot b e eliminated,         although it may
          b e indicated by vibration of the pointer of an analogue instrument or by an unstable
          digital readout. Thermocouple effects can b e eliminated by reversing the test probes
          and averaging the resistance readings taken in each direction.

                                  4.4             Insulation resistance testers
                                 The instrument used should b e capable of developing the test voltage required across
                                 the load.


                                 The test voltage required is:


               Table 64          (a) 2 5 0 V DC for SELVand PELV circuits with equipment such as SPDs that may
                                     influence test results or b e damaged - but the insulation resistance is to b e at
                                     least 1 M Q (643.3.2);
                                 (b) 5 0 0 V DC for all circuits rated u p to and including 5 0 0 V, except SELVand PELV
                                         circuits; and
                                 (c) 1,000 V DC for circuits rated above 5 0 0 V and u p to 1,000 V.


                                 Instruments conforming to BSEN 61557-2 will fulfil all the above instrument requirements.


                                 When an insulation resistance test is applied to a test subject, the measurement            may
                                 b e influenced by different circuit characteristics, for example:


                                 (a) capacitive charging;
                                 (b) absorption or polarization of the insulation; and
                                 (c) conduction or leakage currents.


                                 These factors can b e reduced or eliminated          by extending the test time for which
                                 the test voltage is applied, and can be seen as a steady insulation reading on the
                                 instrument, after a n initial rapid increase in value.


                                 Capacitance may b e as high as 5 pF and the instrument should have an automatic
                                 discharge facility capable of safely discharging such a capacitance. Following an
                                 insulation resistance test, t h e instrument should b e left connected until t h e capacitance
                                 within the installation has b e e n fully discharged.



                                 4.5             EFLI testers
                                 Loop impedance testing is the practice of measuring the impedance of a live circuit.
                                 Typically, t h e circuit voltage, either line-neutral (L-N), line-Earth (L-E) or line-line (L-L),
                                 is first measured to acquire the off-load voltage. A load is then applied and t h e n e w
                                 circuit voltage is measured. The voltage drop is used to calculate the impedance of the
                                 circuit. Exactly how this is done differs between manufacturers. However, all methods
                                 can b e presented with electrical conditions that pose a challenge to the measurement.
                                 Sources of error can include:


                                 (a) electrical noise and transients;
                                 (b) external load switching;
                                 (c) harmonics;
                                 (d) ROD uplift;
                                 (e) test lead contact resistance; and
                                 (f) instrument resolution and proximity to the source transformer (instrument
                                     resolution for many instruments means the instrument cannot provide adequate
                                        readings if taken too close to a supply transformer).

Two-wire high current test:

Test currents higher than 15 A risk tripping some low current miniature circuit-breakers (MCBs).

not to trip         the   RCD, typically          a r o u n d 1 5 m A . However,                1 5 m A does              not      create      a
significant      voltage     drop.     Consequently,           many m o r e test cycles a r e p e r f o r m e d a n d the

For low current           (non-trip)      tests, the instrument                must      monitor       the e a r t h voltage             and

                                  Repeating a test is advised if there is concern about t h e validity of the result, especially
                                  o n noisy supplies.


                                  RCD u p l i f t


                                  RCD uplift is a phenomenon frequently encountered when performing a two- or three-wire
                                 non-trip test. During the test, the RCD internal impedance may sometimes be measured,
                                 increasing the overall circuit impedance. This may be as high as 0.5 Q or more.


                                  RCD uplift can b e avoided by choosing an instrument that declares immunity to this
                                  effect. Alternatively, if uplift is suspected, measuring o n the source and load sides
                                  of the RCD will identify any additional impedance              within the RCD. This can then be
                                  deleted f r o m the measurement.


                                 This phenomenon               is not encountered   with high test currents, but these tests will trip
                                 the RCD during the test, preventing their use.


                                 Transformer impedances can also affect results, as the impedance close to source can
                                 b e very reactive, rather than resistive. This is only a real issue when measuring close
                                 to the source transformer, but the instrument              resolution and accuracy becomes very
                                 significant in this location.


                                 Test l e a d errors


                                 Test leads can induce errors from:


                                 (a) internal lead resistance;
                                 (b) contact resistance of the probes or clips; and
                                 (c) internal fusing of t h e test leads.


                                 As with t h e low resistance ohmmeter              section earlier, t h e test lead resistance can b e
                                 ’nulled' or may already b e accounted for in the instrument. If not, the lead resistance
                                 should b e measured and deducted f r o m future measurement values.


                                 Contact resistance can add significantly to t h e circuit impedance.              Inspectors should
                                 ensure that probes are sharp and that clips grip tightly.


                                 Fused leads can add significantly to lead resistance. A 5 0 0 mA fuse can add as much
                                 as 1.8 Q in a test lead pair. If fused leads are used for loop impedance testing, they
                                 will need to b e fused with higher rating fuses, typically 7 A or 10 A fuses, t o prevent
                                 the test current rupturing the fuse.


                                 Leads compliant to HSE GS38 should be adequate.


                                 Instrument          accuracy and resolution


                                 The resolution of a n instrument is the smallest increment that the instrument can
                                 detect and display. This is usually measured in terms of the multiples of the least
                                 significant      (right-most)      digit of t h e instrument   display. Instrument   resolution   can
                                 compromise measurement accuracy, especially at the lower loop impedances found
                                 near t h e source transformer. When measuring loop impedances below 0.1 Q, caution
                                 should b e exercised in the interpretation             of the results, as the instrument accuracy
                                 significantly affects measurement            values close to t h e lowest end of the range.

For example, when attempting to measure a l o o p impedance of 0.03 Q , an instrument
that declares a ± 5 °/o±3 digits o n a digital display could give an answer between zero
and 0.06 Q and b e within its declared accuracy.


Instruments conforming to BS EN 61557-3 will fulfil the above requirements under
m o s t situations.


These instruments         may also offer additional facilities for deriving prospective          fault
current. The basic measuring principle is the same as for EFLI testers. The current
is calculated by dividing the loop impedance          value into the nominal mains voltage.
Instrument accuracy is determined         by the same factors as for EFLI testers. In this case,
instrument     accuracy decreases as scale reading increases, because the loop value is
divided into the mains voltage. It is important to note these aspects and to consult the
manufacturer's documentation.


4.6        Earth electrode resistance testers
There are three general methods referred to in Section 2 of this Guidance Note:


(a) test method          E l , using a dedicated   earth electrode   tester (fall of potential,
    three- or four-terminal type);
(b) test m e t h o d E2, using a dedicated earth electrode tester                   (stakeless o r
      clamp-type); and
(c) test m e t h o d E3, using an EFLItester.


The most accurate of these is test method E l .


Test method          E2 is more accurate if there are a number       of earth electrodes.        The
method the stakeless or probe tester cannot b e used to measure the resistance of a
single earth electrode unless there is at least one other earth electrode connected,
which may b e formed from extraneous-conductive-parts or, in TN systems, the means
of earthing of the supply.


4.7        RCD testers
The trip times of RCDs are required to b e verified, to ensure adequate disconnection
under fault conditions.


RCDs are tested by applying a test load to t h e RCD, inducing a calibrated test current
to flow in t h e L-E circuit. This creates a n imbalance in t h e L-N currents in t h e RCD and
the device trips. The t i m e it takes to trip is then displayed.


The test instrument should b e capable of applying the full range of test current to an
in-service accuracy as given in BS EN 61557-6. This in-service reading accuracy will
include the effects of voltage variations around the nominal voltage of the tester.


The range of RCD operating currents supported is generally limited to between                10 m A
and 1 A; exceeding these limits presents severe design and cost implications                  to the
instrument design.


As with loop impedance testing, the Earth voltage is monitored and prevented f r o m
exceeding the touch voltage limit, either 5 0 V or 2 5 V, depending o n t h e requirements
of t h e location.

It is relatively easy to make arrangements to disconnect small installations, such as those
at domestic premises, f r o m the supply, to facilitate periodic inspection and testing.


However, asthe size and complexity of an installation increases, isolation f r o m the supply
becomes increasingly difficult. This is particularly true where continuity of supply has
health implications, as may b e the case in hospitals and similar premises, or financial
implications, as would b e the case in banks, share-dealing and commodities markets,
and t h e like. Nevertheless, i t remains necessary to confirm the continuing            suitability
of such installations   for use. Therefore, they must still b e subjected to planned and
preventative maintenance or regular periodic assessment of their condition.


It may well b e possible to carry o u t a thorough visual inspection of such installations
without subjecting the inspector or others in t h e building to any danger, and such an
inspection may identify many common           defects caused by use/abuse. Furthermore,
experience of such installations may provide a valuable insight into commonly occurring
cases of wear a n d tear.


Some defects, however, cannot b e discovered by visual inspection alone. For example,
incorrectly tightened connections can result in a high resistance joint, which can t h e n
cause a high temperature     to occur locally to t h e connection.    If left uncorrected       over
time, further deterioration of t h e connection may well occur, leading to a continuing
increase in temperature,     which may subsequently       present a risk of fire. This fire
risk will b e significantly increased in installations where a build-up        of dust or other
flammable materials can occur in close proximity to the source of heat. It should
also b e remembered      that increased heat at terminations     can result in accelerated
deterioration of the insulation locally. Heating effects symptomatic of a fault or other
problem   within an electrical installation   can also occur as a result of cyclical-load
operations, use of conductors of inadequate current-carrying capacity, incorrect load
balancing and more mechanically related issues, such as incorrect alignment of motor
drive couplings and overtightened belt-drives.


A number of manufacturers offer infrared imaging equipment             which can b e used to
identify such ’hot spots'. Infrared thermography works o n t h e principle that all materials
emit electromagnetic     radiation in the infrared region, which can b e detected              by a
thermal imaging camera.


The amount of radiated energy detected can b e presented in a readily usable form,
typically being shown as differences in colour that vary with the temperature being
detected. Figure 4.1 shows a colour/temperature correlation indicator such as those
that may accompany images. Such scales will aid the person ordering t h e inspection
or responsible for maintenance activities in their interpretation     of t h e thermal images.

HSR25 recognizes that it may b e necessary, in some circumstances, for conductors to
remain live during testing or diagnostic work. However, such work in close proximity to
live conductors may only b e carried out if it can b e done safely and if all precautions
required to allow it to b e done so are put in place. Additionally, the work m a y only
b e performed by persons w h o are suitably competent with regard to the type and
nature of the work activity being performed, as required by Regulation 16 of the EAWR
(Persons to be competent      to prevent danger or injury). HSR25 also makes clear that
although live testing may b e justifiable, it does n o t follow that there will necessarily b e
justification for subsequent repair work to b e carried out live.


Persons carrying out thermographic surveying should:


(a) have sufficient competence to prevent danger and injury.
(b) understand     the system being worked on, t h e hazards that may arise as a result
    of t h e work and t h e precautions that are required to prevent danger.
(c) b e able to identify those parts of equipment      being inspected which are, or are
    capable of being, live when the supply to the equipment          is switched on.
(d) implement all precautions required to prevent injury that have been identified
    as part of t h e risk assessment for the work.
(e) maintain the maximum     possible distance f r o m the live or potentially          live parts
    described above at all times.
(f) maintain    effective control of the area in which the equipment           being inspected
    is situated.
(g) ensure     that all protective measures that m a y have been affected by their
    actions when carrying out t h e inspection       work are fully reinstated. All guards
    and barriers must b e replaced and panel doors, lids and covers must b e closed
    and secured properly after t h e inspection is completed.


As previously mentioned, thermographic inspection can b e an effective m e t h o d of
identifying potential defects that may not be identified by a more conventional visual
inspection. However, such thermal surveying should not b e seen as a substitute for
periodic inspection and testing, but rather as an additional tool that can b e used by
t h e inspector. Thermographic surveys can b e a highly effective means of targeting
preventative maintenance where it is m o s t required. Defects identified may b e factored
into the planned maintenance       programme     for t h e installation, or, where necessary,
may justify the remedial work being performed without delay.

Forms



         This section provides guidance on completing        the necessary schedules, certificates
         and reports associated with inspection and testing. Sample certificates a n d report,
         completed with typical entries, are provided, together with sample Schedules of
         Inspection, Circuit Details and Test Results, again completed      with typical results.


         The section also contains some notes on completion          of the forms, although helpful
         information on this will also b e gained by reading earlier sections of this Guidance Note.


         5.1       Initial verification (inspection and testing) forms
         Following the initial verification of a new installation o r of an addition or alteration to
         an existing installation, an Electrical Installation Certificate   (EIC) or Minor Electrical
         Installation Works Certificate (MEIWC) is required to b e completed and issued, together
         with inspection schedule(s) and test result schedule(s).


         (a)   Form 1 : EIC (three-signatory   version from Appendix 6 of BS 7671).


         When an EIC is used, appropriate numbers of t h e following           forms are required to
         accompany the Certificate:


         (b) Form 2: Schedule of Inspections for domestic and similar premises with u p to
             100 A supply, or a more extensive schedule where necessary (see below).
         (c) Form 3: generic Schedule of Test Results.


 642.3   Form 2 is not suitable for the inspection of installations rated at more than 100 A
         or that are more complex. For such installations, t h e inspector will probably need to
         formulate their own inspection schedules. These should b e based o n the requirements
         of Regulation 642.3 and t h e list of examples of items requiring inspection during initial
         verification, given i n Appendix 6 of BS 7671.


         For completeness,    two samples of typical completed       Form 3 s (Schedule of Circuit
         Details and Test Results) are included here, one being for a single-phase installation
         a n d the other for a three-phase installation.




                                                                                 Guidance N o t e 3 : Inspection & Testing    149

                           5.2        Minor works
                          The complete set of forms for initial verification (inspection    and testing) may not b e
                           necessary for minor works. When an addition to a n electrical installation does not
                           extend to the installation of a n e w circuit, t h e MEIWC may b e used. This one-page
                           certificate is intended for such work as the addition of a socket-outlet o r lighting point
                          to an existing circuit, or for a repair or modification   to each circuit worked on. Where
                           multiple circuits are worked on, all of the work could b e detailed on a n EIC.


                           A MEIWC must not b e used for t h e replacement of a consumer unit.


                          The MEIWC (Form 4) is included here, taken from Appendix 6 of BS7671. Notes o n
                           completion and guidance for recipients are provided with the form.


                           5.3        Periodic inspection and testing
                          The inspection and testing of an existing electrical installation is reported o n using an
                          EICR(Form 5). As with an EIC, this document is issued with the appropriate number
                          of generic Schedule(s)of Circuit Details and Test Results (Form 3).


                          For periodic inspections, the Schedule of Inspections for initial verification (Form 2)
                          should not b e used. The dedicated model suggested in BS7671 (Form 6) may b e used
                          for inspections of domestic installations a n d installations up to 1 0 0 A. For larger and
                          m o r e complex installations, t h e inspector will need to formulate bespoke inspection
                          schedules. These should be based on the requirements          of Regulation 642.3 and t h e
                          list of examples of items requiring inspection for an EICRwhich are applicable, given
                          in Appendix 6 of BS7671.

                                  work associated with an addition or alteration to an existing installation. It should not
                                  have b e e n issued for t h e inspection and testing of an existing electrical installation.
                                  An "Electrical Installation Condition Report" should b e issued for such an inspection.


                                  This Certificate               is only valid if the Schedule of Inspections has been completed   to
                                  confirm that all relevant inspections have been carried out and where accompanied
                                  by Schedule(s) of Circuit Details a n d Test Results.


                                  Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should b e tested
                                  six-monthly by pressing the button marked T or 'Test'. The device should switch off
                                  the supply and should then be switched on to restore the supply. If the device does
                                  not switch off the supply when the button is pressed, seek expert advice. For safety
                                  reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.


                                  Where the installation includes an arc fault detection device (AFDD) having a manual
                                  test facility it should b e tested six-monthly by pressing the test button. Where a n AFDD
                                  has both a test button and automatic test function, manufacturer's                instructions shall
                                  b e followed             with respect to test button operation. Where the installation includes a
                                  surge protection device (SPD)the status indicator should b e checked to confirm it is in
                                  operational condition i n accordance with manufacturer's information. If t h e indication
                                  shows that t h e device is not operational, seek expert advice. For safety reasons it is
                                  important that this instruction is followed.


                                  Where the installation includes                alternative or additional sources of supply, warning
                                  notices should b e found at the origin or meter position, or if remote f r o m the origin,
                                  at the consumer unit or distribution board and at all points of isolation of all sources
                                  of supply.

                                  Generic schedule of circuit details - Notes

                                  The fields of the f o r m are used as follows:


                                  1       The circuit number as marked o n the distribution board or consumer unit. The
                                          normal convention             for single-phase distribution    boards and consumer        units,
                                          circuit 1 is closest to t h e main isolator of the assembly. For single-phase circuits
                                          in three-phase installations, it is preferred to use the designation L I , L2, L3.
                                          For example, for single-phase circuits in the fifth compartment, the designation
                                          would b e 5L1, 5L2 and 5L3.
                                  2       Brief description of t h e circuit.
                                  3       The type of wiring is identified by a code, following                 the convention   at t h e
                                          b o t t o m of t h e form.
                                  4       The reference method             is identified   according   to Table 4 A 2 in Appendix 4 of
                                          BS 7671.
                                  5       The number of points              served is the total number        of accessories or other
                                          connection points for current-using or generating equipment. A double or triple
                                          socket-outlet to BS 1363-2 is usually considered to b e a single point.
                                  6       Number             and size of live conductors.    Where the conductors     are not copper,
                                          this should also b e identified          using the chemical      symbol in this column.     For
                                          example:
                                          •        2x1.5 indicates two copper live conductors with cross-sectional area 1.5 m m 2 ;
                                          •        4 x 1 6 Al indicates four aluminium      live conductors with cross-sectional area
                                                  1 6 m m 2.
                                  7       Number and size of cpc. Where the conductors are not copper, this should also
                                          b e identified using the chemical symbol in this column.
                                  8       Number of the standard for the overcurrent protective device, for example:
                                          •  ’ 6 0 8 9 8 ' for an MCB to BS EN 60898;
                                          •   ' 3 0 3 6 ' for a re-wireable fuse BS 3 0 3 6 .
                                  9       Type of overcurrent protective device, where applicable. For example, B, C or D
                                          for MCBs and RCBOsto BS EN 6 0 8 9 8 or BS EN 61009.
                                  10 Rated operating current l n of the overcurrent protective device.
                                  11 Rated breaking capacity o f t h e overcurrent protective device.
                                  12 Maximum permitted earth fault loop impedance Z s of the circuit for automatic
                                          disconnection of supply. These figures are usually obtained f r o m Tables 41.1 to
                                          41.6 in BS 7671 (see Appendix A). Where table 41.5 of BS 7671 applies for
                                         TT systems served by a public supply, an earth fault loop impedance                 exceeding
                                          2 2 5 Q is unlikely to b e acceptable, as this implies the earth electrode resistance
                                          is unlikely to b e stable as indicated in the Note to Table 41.5 of BS 7671.
                                  13 Number of the standard for the RCD protecting the circuit (if any), for example
                                         '610009'            for an RCBO to BS EN 61009.
                                  14 Type of t h e RCD protecting t h e circuit (if any), either 'AC','A’,'F' or 'B'.
                                  15 Residual current rating of the RCD protecting the circuit (if any).
                                  16 Maximum operating current of t h e RCD protecting the circuit (if any).

                                          normal convention                 for single-phase    distribution boards and consumer units,
                                          circuit 1 is closest to t h e main isolator of t h e assembly. For single-phase circuits
                                          in three-phase installations, it is preferred to use the designation                     LI, L2, L3.
                                          For example, for single-phase circuits in the fifth compartment, the designation
                                          would b e 5L1, 5L2 and 5L3.

                           MINOR ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION WORKS CERTIFICATE(MEIWC)

                           Notes for the person producing the Certificate

                           Scope

                           The MEIWC is intended to be used for alterations or additions to an installation that do
                           not extend to the provision of a new circuit. Examples include the addition of socket
                           outlets or lighting points to an existing circuit, the relocation of a light switch, and
                           similar. This Certificate may also be used for the replacement of equipment such as
                           accessories or luminaires, but not for the replacement of distribution boards, consumer
                           units or similar items. Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be
                           carried out, irrespective of the extent of the work undertaken.

                           Part 1 Description of the minor works

                           1,2,3     The minor works must be so described that the work that is the subject of
                                     the certification can be readily identified.
                           4         See Regulations 120.3 and 133.5. No departures are to be expected, except
                                     in the most unusual circumstances. See also Regulation 644.1.
                           5         Note any defects observed in the existing installation that are not related to
                                     the work being carried out.

                          Under the "Comments on existing installation ..." heading, only deficiencies that do
                          not impair the safety of any alteration or addition covered by the Certificate may be
                          referred to. An example would b e existing main bonding conductors identified by
                          the colour green only (rather than green-and-yellow) or which have a csa less than
                          that required by Chapter 54, but which are nevertheless considered adequate by the
                          designer of the alteration or addition.

                          Any deficiency liable to impair the safety of the alteration or addition must be corrected
                          before the alteration or addition is carried out (see Regulation 132.16). It would be
                          unacceptable simply to refer to the deficiency on the Certificate.

                          Part 2 Installation earthing and bonding: existing installation

                          The existing earthing and bonding must be inspected and tested to confirm that it is
                          adequate for the new works. Any extension to earthing and bonding must be installed
                          for the works, if required.

                          Part 3 Circuit details

                          Generally, for domestic installations, this is simple: record details of the circuit protective
                          device and circuit conductors.

                          COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT CHART DETAILS ON THE DISTRIBUTION BOARD OR
                          CONSUMER UNIT.

                          Part 4 Essential tests

                          The relevant provisions of Part 6 (Inspection and testing) of BS7671 must be applied
                          in full to all minor works. For example, where a socket-outlet is added to an existing
                          circuit, it is necessary to:

(a) establish that t h e earthing contact of the socket-outlet is connected to a suitable
    means of earthing via the MET;
(b) measure the insulation      resistance of t h e circuit that has been added to and
    establish that i t complies with Table 6 4 of BS 7671;
(c) measure the EFLIto establish that the maximum            permitted   disconnection        time
    is not exceeded;
(d) check that t h e polarity of t h e socket-outlet is correct; and
(e) if t h e work is protected by an RCD, verify the effectiveness of the RCD.


Part 5 Declaration


When filling out a n d signing a form o n behalf of a company or other business entity,
individuals m u s t state for w h o m they are acting.


GUIDANCE FOR RECIPIENTS (to be a p p e n d e d t o the Certificate)


This Certificate has been issued to confirm that t h e electrical installation work to which
it relates has been designed, constructed,      inspected and tested in accordance with
BS 7671.


You should have received an 'original' Certificate and t h e person that issued the
Certificate should have retained a duplicate. If you were the person ordering the work,
but n o t t h e owner of t h e installation, you should pass this Certificate, or a copy of
it, to the owner. A separate Certificate should have been received for each existing
circuit o n which minor works have been carried out. This Certificate is not appropriate
if you requested the person that issued the Certificate to undertake m o r e extensive
installation work, for which you should have received an EIC.


The Certificate   should b e retained in a safe place and b e shown to any person
inspecting or undertaking further work o n the electrical installation in the future. If
you later vacate the property, this Certificate will demonstrate to the n e w owner that
the minor electrical installation work carried out complied      with the requirements           of
BS7671 at the time t h e Certificate was issued.


For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to b e inspected at appropriate
intervals by a skilled person or persons, competent     in such work.


Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should b e tested
six-monthly by pressing t h e button marked T      or 'Test'. The device should switch off
t h e supply and should then b e switched o n to restore t h e supply. If the device does
not switch off t h e supply w h e n the button is pressed, seek expert advice. For safety
reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.


Where t h e installation includes an arc fault detection device (AFDD) having a manual
test facility it should b e tested six-monthly by pressing the test button. Where a n AFDD
has both a test button and automatic test function, manufacturer's instructions shall b e
followed with respect to test button operation.


Where the installation includes a surge protection      device (SPD) the status indicator
should b e checked to confirm it is in operational condition in accordance with
manufacturer's information. If the indication shows that t h e device is n o t operational,
seek expert advice. For safety reasons it is important that this instruction is followed.




                                                                        Guidance Note 3: Inspection & Testing        163

                                   Where the installation includes alternative or additional sources of supply, warning
                                   notices should be found at the origin or meter position, or if remote from the origin,
                                   at the consumer unit or distribution board and at all points of isolation of all sources
                                   of supply.

                                           distribution board. An installation which was designed to an earlier edition of
                                          BS 7671 or the IEE Wiring Regulations and which does not fully comply with
                                          the current edition is not necessarily unsafe for continued use, or requires
                                          upgrading. Only damage, deterioration,                   defects, dangerous conditions        and non-
                                           compliance with the requirements of BS 7 6 7 1 or t h e IEE Wiring Regulations,
                                           which may give rise t o danger, should b e recorded.
                                  2       The Report, normally comprising at least five pages, should include schedules
                                          of both the inspection a n d t h e test results. Additional pages may be necessary
                                          for other than a simple installation a n d for the "Guidance for recipients". The
                                          number of each page should b e indicated, together with the total number                              of
                                          pages involved.
                                  3       The reason for producing this Report, such as change of occupancy or landlord's
                                          periodic maintenance, should b e identified in Section B.
                                  4       Those elements of the installation that are covered by the Report and those
                                          that are not should b e identified in Section D (Extent and limitations). These
                                          aspects should have b e e n agreed with the person ordering the report and
                                          other interested parties before the inspection and testing commenced. Any
                                          operational limitations, such as inability t o gain access t o parts of the installation
                                          or an item of equipment, should also b e recorded in Section D.
                                  5       The maximum prospective value of fault current (l p f) recorded should b e the
                                          greater of either the prospective value of short-circuit current or the prospective
                                          value of earth fault current.
                                  6       Where a n installation has an alternative source of supply a further schedule of
                                          supply characteristics and earthing arrangements based u p o n Section I of this
                                          Report should b e provided.
                                  7       A summary of the condition of the installation in terms of safety should
                                          b e clearly stated in Section E. Observations, if any, should b e categorized in
                                          Section K using the coding C l to C3 as appropriate.                            Any observation given

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION C O N D I T I O N R E P O R T


GUIDANCE F O R RECIPIENTS (to b e appended t o the Report)


This Report is a n i m p o r t a n t and valuable d o c u m e n t which should b e r e t a i n e d
f o r future reference.


1   The purpose of this Condition Report is to confirm, so far as reasonably
    practicable, whether or not the electrical installation is in a satisfactory condition
    for continued       service (see Section E). The Report should identify any damage,
    deterioration, defects and/or conditions which may give rise to danger (see
    Section K).
2   This Report is only valid if accompanied by the Inspection Schedule(s) and the
    Schedule(s) of Circuit Details and Test Results.
3   The person ordering the Report should have received the 'original' Report and
    the inspector should have retained a duplicate.
4   The 'original' Report should b e retained in a safe place and be made available
    to any person inspecting or undertaking work o n t h e electrical installation in
    the future. If t h e property is vacated, this Report will provide the n e w o w n e r /
    occupier with details of t h e condition of the electrical installation at the t i m e the
    Report was issued.
5   Section D (Extent and Limitations) should identify fully t h e extent of the
    installation covered by this Report and any limitations o n the inspection and
    testing. The inspector         should    have agreed      these     aspects with         the   person
    ordering     the    Report    and with    other    interested     parties     (licensing    authority,
    insurance company, mortgage provider and the like) before t h e inspection was
    carried out.
6   Some operational limitations such as inability to gain access to parts of t h e
    installation or an item of equipment m a y have been encountered during the
    inspection. The inspector should have noted these in Section D.
7   For items classified in Section K as C l ('Danger present'), t h e safety o f t h o s e
    using the installation is at risk, and it is recommended that a skilled person
    or persons competent          in electrical installation work undertakes the necessary
    remedial work immediately.
8   For items classified in Section K as C2 ('Potentially dangerous'), the safety o f
    those using the installation may b e a t risk and it is recommended that a
    skilled person or persons competent               in electrical installation work undertakes
    the necessary remedial work as a matter of urgency.
9   Where it has been stated in Section K that an observation requires further
    investigation (code Fl) the inspection has revealed an apparent deficiency which
    may result in a code C l or C2, and could not, due to the extent or limitations
    of t h e inspection,    b e fully identified. Such observations should b e investigated
    without    delay. A further examination           of the installation       will be necessary, to
    determine     the nature and extent of the apparent deficiency (see Section F).
10 For safety reasons, t h e electrical installation should b e re-inspected at
    appropriate intervals by a skilled person or persons, competent in such work.
    The recommended       date by which t h e next inspection is due is stated in
    Section F of the Report under 'Recommendations'.
11 Where the installation includes a residual current device (RCD) it should b e
    tested    six-monthly    by pressing the button          marked     T       or 'Test'. The device
    should     switch   off the    supply    and should     then    b e switched        o n to restore
    the supply. If t h e device does n o t switch off t h e supply when t h e button is
    pressed, seek expert advice. For safety reasons i t is i m p o r t a n t t h a t this
    instruction is followed.

Maximum permissible measured

            Al       Tables
  643.7.3   The tables in this appendix provide maximum              permissible    measured EFLI (Z s) for
411.4.201   compliance with BS 7671, which must not b e exceeded when the tests are carried
411.4.202   out at an ambient temperature of 10 °C. Table A7 provides correction factors for other
411.4.203   ambient temperatures.

            Where t h e cables to b e used are to Table 3, 4 or 5 of BS 6004, Table 3, 4 o r 5 o f
            BS 7211, Table B.l or B.2 of BS EN 50525-3-41 or are other thermoplastic (PVC) or
            thermosetting (low smoke halogen-free - LSHF) cables to these British Standards,
            and the cable loading is such that the maximum operating temperature is 70 °C, then
            Tables A l to A4 give the maximum EFLIfor circuits with:


            (a) protective conductors of copper and having f r o m 1 m m 2 to 16 m m 2 csa; and
            (b) an overcurrent protective device (OCPD) (i.e. a fuse) to BS 3 0 3 6 , BS 88-2,
                 BS 88-3 or BS 1361.


            For each t y p e of fuse, two tables are given:


411.3.2.2   1    where the circuit concerned is a final circuit not exceeding 32 A for circuits
                 supplying only fixed equipment,   or 6 3 A for circuits with one o r m o r e
                 socket-outlets, and the maximum disconnection t i m e for compliance with
                 Regulation 411.3.2.2 is 0.4 s for TN systems; and
411.3.2.3   2    where the circuit concerned is a final circuit exceeding 32 A for circuits
                 supplying only fixed equipment, or 63 A for circuits with one or m o r e
                 socket-outlets,   or   a   distribution   circuit   and   the     disconnection        time     for
                 compliance with Regulation 411.3.2.3 is 5 s for TN systems.


  543.1.3   In each table, the EFLI given correspond to t h e appropriate disconnection time f r o m
            a comparison of the time/current characteristics of t h e device concerned and t h e
            adiabatic equation given in Regulation 543.1.3.


            The tabulated values apply only where the nominal voltage to Earth (U o) is 2 3 0 V.


            Table A5 gives the maximum        measured Z s for circuits protected by circuit-breakers to
            BS 3871-1 and BS EN 6 0 8 9 8 , and RCBOsto BS EN 61009.

                              Note:        The impedances tabulated in this appendix are lower than those in Tables 41.2 to
  Tables 41.2 to 41.4
                                           41.4 of BS 7671. This is because the impedances in this appendix are measured
              543.1.3                      values at an assumed conductor temperature of 10 °C, whilst those in BS 7671 are
                                           design figures at the line conductor maximum permitted operating temperature given
                                           in Table 52.1 of BS 7671 and the protective conductor assumed initial temperature
                                           given in Tables 54.2 to 54.5 of BS7671. The correction factor (divisor) used is 1.25.
                                           This corresponds to the line conductor maximum operating temperature and
                                           protective conductor assumed initial temperature both being 70 °C. For smaller csa
                                           cables, the impedance may also be limited by the adiabatic equation of Regulation
                                           543.1.3. A value of k of 115 from Table 54.3 of BS 7671 is used. This is suitable for
                                           PVCinsulated and sheathed cables to Tables 3, 4 or 5 of BS6004 and forthermosetting

                                           B.2 of BS EN 50525-3-41 . The k value is based o n both the thermoplastic (PVC) and
                                           thermosetting (LSHF) cables operating at a maximum temperature of 70 °C.

                            be seen from Table A3 that the maximum measured EFLI for BS 88-3 fuses
                            cannot be applied to circuits protected by BS 1361 fuses, even of the same
                            nominal rating. For example, the maximum permitted EFLI for 20 A fuses to
                               BS 88-3 is far higher than that permitted for a circuit protected by a 20 A fuse to BS 1361.

A3          Methods of adjusting tabulated values of Z s
(See also Section 2.6.16 (EFLI verification).)


 A circuit is wired in flat t w i n and cpc 70 °C thermoplastic (PVC) cable and protected
by a 6 A Type B circuit-breaker to BS EN 60898.                            When tested at a n ambient
temperature          below 20 °C, determine                 the maximum   acceptable measured value of
Z s for the circuit.


Solution:



 Ztest ( m a x ) “     Zs

 From Table 41.3(a) of BS7671, the maximum permitted value of Zs = 7.28 Q
 From Table B3 in Appendix B of this Guidance Note, F = 1.20

Ztest (max) = 1 , 2 0       X




Ztest (max) = 6 . 0 7 Q


A more accurate value can b e obtained if t h e external EFLI,Ze , is known. I n this case,
the following formula may b e used:


  test - Z e + |z (z   s        Z e)


In the example above, assume Ze is 0.35. Thus, t h e m o r e accurate value is:

 Ztest (max) = 0 . 3 5 + 1 2                    -28-0.35)

 Ztest (max) = 6 . 1 3 Q


Where the test ambient                        temperature   is likely to b e other than 2 0 °C, a further
correction can b e m a d e to convert t h e value to correspond with the expected ambient
temperature, using the following formula:

Ztest (max) = 2 e +                    Z e)


where a is given by Table B2 of Appendix B.


In the example above, assume the test ambient temperature                         is 5 °C.

From Table B2, a = 0.94

Thus, the accurate reading including temperature                     compensation     is:

Ztest(max)= 0 . 3 5 +                     (7.28-0.35)

Aest   (max) = 5 . 7 8 Q

                          Note:        Where reduced csa protective conductors are used, maximum EFLIsmay need to
                                       be further reduced to ensure disconnection times are sufficiently short to prevent
                                       overheating of protective conductors during earth faults. The requirement of the
                                       equation in Regulation 543.1.3 needs to be met:




                          where:


                                  S         is the nominal csa of the conductor in m m 2
                                            means greaterthan or equal to

                                  k         heat capacity of the conductor material and the appropriate initial and final
                                  I         temperatures; see Tables 54.2-54.4
                                            is the value in amps (rms for AC) of fault current for a fault of negligible
                                  Zs        impedance, which can flow through the associated protective device, d u e
                                  t        account being taken of the current-limiting effect of the circuit impedances
                                           and the limiting capability (12 t) of that protective device
                                           is the loop impedance at conductor normal operating temperature
                                           is the operating t i m e of the overcurrent device in s corresponding to t h e
                                           fault current I a m p s - obtained from the graphs in Appendix 3 of BS7671,
                                           as the prospective earth fault current I (= U q X Cm jn /Z s) is known.


                          Note:        Cm in is the minimum voltage factor, the meaning of which is explained in Section A2
                                       of this appendix.


                          The following example illustrates h o w measurements taken at 2 0 °C may b e adjusted
                          to 70 °C values, taking t h e (R] + R2) reading for t h e circuit into account.


                           In the previous example, taking t h e (Ri + R2) reading for t h e circuit as 0.2 Q :


                           Z s for t h e circuit at 70 °C

                                   = Ze +F(R 1 + R 2)test
                                   = 0.35+1.20x0.2
                                   = 0.59 Q
                           The temperature-corrected Z s figure of 0.59 Q is acceptable, as it is less than t h e
                           maximum value of 7.28 Q given in Table 41.3 of BS 7671.


                          The formula above involves taking measurements at 2 0 °C and converting t h e m to
                          70 °C values. Alternatively, t h e 70 °C values can b e converted to t h e values at t h e
                          expected ambient temperature, for example, 20 °C, when the measurement is carried out.

Taking t h e same circuit:


Ztest   = Ze + ( R i + Rz)test

        = 0.55Q

From the formula: Z test ( m a x ) = p Z   s   Z s (m a x) f r o m B S 7 6 7 1 = 7.28 Q

         it is necessary to establish the impedances of the circuit conductors to determine the
         fault current, I, and hence the protective device disconnection                                     time, t.

                        depending o n time and place, changing of transformer taps and other
                        considerations

         Ri             is        the resistance of the line conductor from the origin of the circuit
                                  to the point of utilization
         r2             is        the resistance of the protective conductor from the origin of the
                                  circuit to the point of utilization.


        Similarly, in order to design circuits for compliance with the limiting values of EFLIgiven
        in Tables 41.2 to 41.4 of BS7671, it is necessary to establish the relevant impedances
        of the circuit conductors w h e n the line conductor is at t h e appropriate maximum
        permitted   operating temperature,               as given in Table 52.1 of BS7671, and the cpc is at
        t h e appropriate 'assumed initial temperature', as given in Tables 54.2 to 54.5.

Use of an earth leakage current
clamp meter to provide an indication
of the state of insulation

     Where safe access is available to enclose the live conductors            in a current clamp,
     but not t h e protective conductor, a suitably rated earth leakage current clamp meter
     (sometimes called a tong tester) can b e used to provide an indication of t h e state of
     insulation in a circuit downstream of the test point, by measuring 'earth leakage'. An
     example is shown i n Figure C l .


     In small installations, readings of a few milliamps will indicate protective conductor
     currents, but readings of many amps may indicate a line-to-earth or neutral-to-earth fault.

Safety check for diverted
neutral currents

    DI        Dangers associated with diverted neutral currents
    Diverted neutral currents can occur if there is a break i n the protective earth and
    neutral (PEN) conductor in the distribution network supplying an installation with
    a PME earthing arrangement. Diverted neutral currents can cause hazardous touch
    voltages on the protective       earthing   system in an installation,   including     the main
    earthing terminal, extraneous-conductive-parts, circuit protective conductors, and
    exposed-conductive-parts.


    Installations that might b e affected by diverted neutral currents include:


    (a) installations in which PME conditions apply (TN-C-S earthing arrangement f r o m
         a public distribution   network); and
    (b) installations with TN-S or TT earthing arrangements, that share extraneous-
         conductive-parts with installations in which PME conditions apply.


    Precautions should b e taken before working o n any installation to determine               if any
    hazardous touch voltages exist o n conductive parts. This is particularly important when
    working outdoors and in contact with t h e general mass of Earth. Precautions should
    also b e taken before disconnecting     any earthing or protective bonding conductors.


    Note:     Diverted neutral currents may originate from another installation, and so may be
              present even if the installation is isolated.


    D2        How to check for diverted neutral currents
    There is n o simple test that will indicate the presence of diverted neutral currents.
    However, some simple checks can b e made with voltage indicators, non-contact
    voltage testers, and earth leakage current clamp ammeters, along with an external EFLI
    test. An example of an approach that could b e used in dwellings is shown in Table D I .


    If an open-ciruit PEN conductor or diverted neutral currents are suspected after carrying
    out the safety checks, the DNO should b e informed immediately using the emergency
    number 105.


    Notes:
    1    If there is an open-circuit PEN conductor, the line to neutral voltage may rise to 400 V
         nominal.
    2    One way of measuring earth leakage is to use a leakage current clamp ammeter.
         Leakage current clamp meters are similar to those used for measuring load current, but
         are more sensitive and therefore more accurate at measuring currents below 5 mA.

                           The installation may import or export diverted neutral current. Exported neutral current
                           occurs where there is a broken PEN conductor in the supply cable to the installation,
                           so neutral current finds its way back to the supply transformer through extraneous-
                           conductive-parts shared with other installations that have an intact PEN conductor.
                          Imported neutral current occurs where neutral currents f r o m another installation are
                           exporting neutral current, and these are returning to the supply transformer through
                          the PEN conductor of t h e installation concerned, via extraneous-conductive-parts.
