6   On-Site Guide
    ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology
               The On-Site Guide is one of a number of publications prepared by the lET to provide
               guidance on certain aspects of BS 7671 :2018 Requirements for Electrical Installations,
               lET Wiring Regulations, 18th Edition. BS 7671 is a joint publication of the British Standards
               Institution and the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

      11 0.1   The scope generally follows that of BS 7671 . The Guide includes material not included in
               BS 7671, it provides background to the intentions of BS 7671 and gives other sources of
               information. However, it does not ensure compliance with BS 7671 . It is a simple guide
               to the requirements of BS 7671; electrical installers should always consult BS 7671 to
               satisfy themselves of compliance.
               It is expected that persons carrying out work in accordance with this guide will be
               competent to do so.
HSR25, EWR    Electrical installations in the United Kingdom which comply with the lET Wiring
Regulation 16 Regulations, BS 7671, must comply with all relevant statutory regulations, such as the
              Electricity at Work Regulations 1989, the Building Regulations and, where relevant, the
              Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002, as amended.

      114.1    It cannot be guaranteed that BS 7671 complies with all relevant statutory regulations.
      115.1    It is, therefore, essential to establish which statutory and other appropriate regulations
               apply and to install accordingly. For example, an installation in licensed premises may
               have requirements which differ from or are additional to those of BS 7671, and these
               will take precedence.

Part 1   This Guide is concerned with limited application of BS 7671 in accordance with paragraph
         1.1: Scope.
         BS 7671 and the On-Site Guide are not design guides.

         It is essential to prepare a design and/or schedule of the work to be done prior to
         commencement or alteration of an electrical installation and to provide all necessary
         information and operating instructions of any equipment supplied to the user on
         completion.

         Any specification should set out the detailed design and provide sufficient information to
         enable competent persons to carry out the installation and commissioning.

         The specification must provide for all the commissioning procedures that will be required
         and for the production of any operation and maintenance manual and building logbook.
         The persons or organisations who may be concerned in the preparation of the
         specification include the:
               Ill>   Designer(s)
               Ill>   lnstaller(s)
               Ill>   Electricity Distributor
               Ill>   Installation Owner and/or User
               Ill>   Architect
               Ill>   Local Building Control Authority/Standards Division or Approved Inspector
               Ill>   Fire Prevention Officer
               Ill>   CDM Coordinator
               Ill>   BIM Coordinator
               Ill>   Regulatory Authorities
               Ill>   Licensing Authority (where necessary)
               Ill>   Health and Safety Executive.

         In producing the specification, advice should be sought from the installation owner and/
         or user as to the intended use. Often, such as in a speculative building, the detailed
         intended use is unknown. In those circumstances the specification and/or the operation
         and maintenance manual and building logbook must set out the basis of use for which
         the installation is suitable.



                                                                                         On-Site Guide       9

       Precise details of each item of equipment should be obtained from the manufacturer
       and/or supplier and compliance with appropriate standards confirmed.
       The operation and maintenance manual must include a description of how the installed
       system is to operate and must include all commissioning records. The manual should also
       include manufacturers' technical data for all items of switchgear, luminaires, accessories,
       etc. and any special instructions that may be needed.
       Building Regulations 2010, Part L 2013 (Amended 2016) of England, for example,
       requires that building owners or operators are provided with summary information
       relating to a new or refurbished building which includes building services information
       and the maintenance requirements in a building logbook. Information on how to develop
       and assemble a building logbook can be obtained from CIBSE:

               1.1         Scope
               This Guide is for installers (for simplicity, the term installer has been used for electricians
               and electrical installers). It covers the following installations:

                       (a) domestic and similar installations, including off-peak supplies, supplies to
                           associated garages, outbuildings and the like; and
                       (b) small industrial and commercial single- and three-phase installations.
     Part 7    Note:       Special Installations or Locations (Part 7 of BS 7671) are generally excluded from this Guide.
                           Advice, however, is given on installations in locations containing a bath or shower and
                           underfloor heating installations.

               This Guide is restricted to installations:
     313.1             (a) at a supply frequency of 50 Hz
                       (b) at a nominal voltage of 230 V AC single-phase or 400/230 V AC three-phase
                       (c) supplied through a distributor's cut-out having a fuse or fuses rated at 100 A or
                           less to one of the following standards:
                           - BS 88-2
                           - BS 88-3
                           - BS 88-6
                           - BS 1361 Type II
               Note:       BS 1361 was w ithdrawn in March 2010 and replaced by BS 88-3; BS 88-2.2 and BS 88-6 were
                           withdrawn in March 2010 and replaced by BS 88-2 (BS EN 60269-2) but fuses complying w ith
                           these w ithdrawn standards w ill be found in existing installations for many years to come.

                           arrangements outside the consumer's installation commonly quoted by
                           distributors are as follows:

                           ll> TN-C -S arrangement - 0.35 0, see Figure 2.1 (i)
                           ll> TN-S arrangement - 0.8 0, see Figure 2.1 (ii)

               Note:      The values of 0.35 0 and 0.8 0 are typical maximum values as quoted by distributors of
                          electricity upon enquiry which will aid, for example, designs for new-build installations.

Table 4 1. 5               For a TT arrangement, 21 0 is the usual stated maximum resistance of the

                             stable due to environmental changes, i.e. drying out in summer and freezing in
                             winter.
Appx E     This Guide also contains information which may be required in general installation work,
           for example, conduit and trunking capacities, bending radii of cables, etc.
           The Guide introduces the use of standard circuits, which are discussed in Section 7.
           However, because of simplification, this Guide may not give the most economical result.
           This Guide is not a replacement for BS 7671, which should always be consulted.
           Defined terms according to Part 2 of BS 7671 are used.
           In compliance with the definitions of BS 7671, throughout this Guide the term line
           conductor is used instead of phase conductor and live part is used to refer to a conductor
           or conductive part intended to be energised in normal use, including a neutral conductor.
           The terminals of electrical equipment are identified by the letters L, N and E (or PE).

       1.2.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 (as
             amended)
       The detailed requirements are given in the Technical Standards for compliance with the
       Building (Scotland) Regulations.
       Guidance on how to achieve compliance with these Standards is given in two Scottish
       Building Standards Technical Handbooks- Domestic and Non-domestic.
       These handbooks contain recommendations for electrical installations, including the
       following:
               -    compliance with BS 7671
               -    minimum number of socket-outlets in dwellings
               -    minimum number of lighting points in dwellings
               -    minimum illumination levels in common areas of domestic buildings, for
                    example, blocks of flats
               -    a range of mounting heights of switches and socket-outlets, etc.
               -    separate switching for concealed socket-outlets, for example, behind white
                    goods in kitchens
               -    conservation of fuel and power in buildings.
       With regard to electrical installations in Scotland, the requirements of the above are
       deemed to be satisfied by complying with BS 7671.
       Note:         The handbooks are available in electronic format only from the Building Standards Division of
                     the Scottish Government from website: www.scotland.gov.uk/bsd


       1.2.3 The Building Regulations of Northern Ireland
       The Building Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (as amended) apply.

       1.2.4 The Building Regulations of Wales
       On 31 December 2011 the power to make building regulations for Wales was transferred
       to Welsh Ministers. This means Welsh Ministers will make any new building regulations
       or publish any new building regulations guidance applicable in Wales from that date.
       The Building Regulations 2010 and related guidance for England and Wales, including
       approved documents as at that date, will conti nue to apply in Wales until Welsh Ministers
       make changes to them. As guidance is reviewed and changes made, Welsh Ministers will
       publish separate approved documents.

 313.1   1.3       Basic information required
         Before starting work on an installation which requires a new electrical supply, the installer
         should establish the following information with the local electricity distributor:
               (a) the number of live conductors required by the design
               (b) the distributor's requirement for cross-sectional area and maximum* length of
                   the consumer's tails
               (c) the maximum prospective fault current (lpf) at the supply terminals
               (d) the typical maximum earth fault loop impedance (Ze) of the earth fault path
                   outside the consumer's installation
               (e) the type and rating of the distributor's fusible cut-out or protective device
544.1          (f) the distributor's requirements regarding the size of main protective bonding
                   conductors
  312          (g) the conductor arrangement and system earthing
               (h) the arrangements for the incoming cable and metering.

         *Some distributors will specify a maximum permitted length for consumer's tails. The
         distributor may also apply pa rticular requirements for isolation or protection.
132.16   For additions and alterations to existing installations, installers should satisfy themselves
         as to the suitability of the supply, the distributor's equipment and the earthing and
         bonding arrangements.


120.3    1.4       Intended departures from BS 7671
         Where the designer decides to depart from the requirements of BS 7671, the resulting
         degree of safety must not be less than that obtained by compliance with the Regulations.
         The designer is responsible for the safety of the design. Any intended departure from
         the requirements of BS 7671, although the designer is confident regarding safety, must
         be recorded on the Electrical Installation Certificate. There is a difference between an
         intended departure and a non-compliance; points to note:
               -   an intended departure must be recorded on the Electrical Installation
                   Certificate
               -   an intended departure not recorded on the Electrical Installation Certificate
                   is unacceptable, as it is simply a non-compliance and the certificate would,

           of the distributor, the cut-out may be assumed to provide protedion against fault current
           up to the consumer's main switch.
           As the cut-out is the property of the distributor, installers must not cut seals and withdraw
           cut-out fuses without permission. Where removal of the cut-out for isolation is required,
           the supplier of electricity should be contacted to arrange disconnection and subsequent
           reconnection.

              2.2.3.1         Consumer's tails
              The cables between the electricity meter and the consumer unit, known as the
              consumer's tails, are part of the consumer's installation and should be insulated and non-
              metallic sheathed or insulated and enclosed within containment, for example, conduit or
              trunking. Consumer's tails are provided by the installer and are the responsibility of the
              owner of the electrical installation.
 514.3.1      Polarity should be indicated by the colour of the insulation and the minimum cable size
              should be 25 mm 2 • The distributor may specify the maximum length of tails between
              the meter and the consumer unit in addition to the minimum cross-sectional area
              (see 1.3). In some cases, the distributor may require an electricity isolator switch
              (see 2.2.4).
434.3(iv)     Where the consumer's tails are protected against fault current by the distributor's cut-out,
              the method of installation, maximum length and minimum cross-sectional area of the
              tails must comply with the requirements of the distributor.

              2.2.3.2         Supplier's tails
              The cables between the supplier's cut-out and the electricity meter, known as the
              supplier's tails, are part of the supplier's equipment.
5226202       Where tails are buried in walls or enclosed within the fabric of the building, further
5526.203      protection is required (see 7.3.2).
              It is important that both supplier's and consumer's tails are sufficiently protected from
              mechanical damage and disturbance by the use of trunking and/or cable clips; see 2.2.6
              of this Guide.

              2.2.4 Eledricity isolator switch
              Distributors may provide and install an electricity isolator switch between the meter and
              the consumer unit, labelled as Electricity isolator switch in Figures 2.1 (i) to 2.1 (iii) and
              2.2.3. This double-pole switch permits the supply to the installation to be interrupted
              without withdrawing the distributor's cut-out fuse.

              2.2.5 Consumer's cont.rolgear
536.4.201     A consumer unit assembly (to BS EN 61439-3:2012) is for use on single-phase
              installations up to 100 A and may include the following components:
                      Jilt-   a double-pole isolator
                      Jilt-   fuses, circuit-breakers or RCBOs for protection against overload and fault
                              currents
                      Jilt-   RCDs for additional protection against electric shock
                      Jilt-   RCDs for fault protection.
                      Jilt-   Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDD) for additional protection against fire.
              Alternatively, a separate main switch and distribution board may be provided.

               domestic garages and outbuildings, one of the following applies:
                       ..,. the enclosure is to be manufactured from non-combustible material; or
                       ..,. the consumer unit is enclosed in a cabinet constructed from non-combustible
                            material.
               Ferrous metal, i.e. steel, is deemed to be an example of a non-combustible material.
               Plastic enclosures manufactured from 960 degree glow-wire rated material would not be
               classified as 'non-combustible' in the context of this regulation.
               Where a steel consumer unit is installed in an installation forming part of a n system,
               the earth fault loop impedance, 4, is likely to be much higher than the maximum that
               is permitted for use of the overcurrent protective device, i.e. cut-out, in order to provide
               fault protection. Should the consumer's tails become loose or damaged and make
               contact with the metal enclosure, it is likely that the overcurrent device will not operate
               within the maximum permitted time of 5 s.
421.1.201      The lET's Wiring Regulations Policy Committee, therefore, advises the following:
                       (a) A Class I metal consumer unit is installed and each outgoing circuit is protected
                           by an RCBO
531.3.5.3.2.           (b) A split, Class I metal consumer unit is installed, where the double-pole main
        201
                           switch of the consumer unit should incorporate an S type (time delayed)
                           RCCB, e.g. 100 mA S-type R CCB.
               Note:         In cases where RCBOs protect each outgoing circuit, the risk of the solid busbar (connecting
                             the supply side of each RCBO) making contact with the ferrous enclosure is minimal. In
                             split consumer units, where two or three RCCBs protect multiple circuits through individual
                             circuit-breakers, the risk of the single-insulated conductors (connecting the load side of the
                             double-pole main switch to the supply side of the RCCBs) making contact with the ferrous
                             enclosure due to vibration and/or abrasion or being damaged is far higher. In essence, where
                             the construction and layout of the consumer unit is such that the risk of live conductors making
                             contact with the ferrous enclosure is minimal, then the double-pole main switch need not
                             incorporate an S-type RCCB.

               In all cases:
412.2.4.1              (a) the consumer's tails need to meet the requirements for the protective measure
531.3.5.3.                 of double or reinforced insulation throughout their length. This can be achieved
    2.201
                           by the use of single-core insulated and non-metallic sheathed cable with the
                           sheath being kept on the right up to the terminals of the incoming device (main
                           switch or RCD) of the consumer unit.
 522.8.1               (b) the consumer's tails need to be protected to avoid mechanical damage and
                           disturbance at the incoming terminals in the consumer unit in order to avoid
                           the line conductor becoming disconnected and making contact with the metal
                           enclosure. This can be achieved by, for example, clipping or clamping the
                           consumer's tails, or by installing them in trunking and the use of a suitable
                           cable-entry gland. In all cable entry arrangements, the enclosure shall not have
                           sharp edges that could damage cables.

                         This can generally xbe achieved by the installer ensuring that cable access

                              • 1.0 mm for the horizontal top surface and
                              • 2.5 mm for all other surfaces of the enclosure that are accessible after
                                installation.

                     The installer could for example, select as they deem appropriate; trunking,
                     conduit, cable gland or cable entry accessories to minimise the opening around
                     the cables.

522.8.1           (d) the consumer's tails also need to be protected to avoid any foreseeable damage
521.5.1               and, where entering a ferrous enclosure, do so through the same entry point.
          A non-combustible enclosure includes base, cover, door and any components, e.g.
          hinges, covers, screws and catches necessary to maintain fire containment. Devices and
          blanks are contained within the non-combustible enclosure and, therefore do not have
          to be manufactured from a non-combustible material, e.g. steel. However, the use of
          non-combustible blanks is not precluded.
          Note:       Information on consumer units kindly provided by BEAMA. This and more can be found here:
                      http://www.beama.org.uk/en/publications/technical-bulletins.cfm

          Where the consumer unit is to be located in an external non-habitable building, e.g. a
          garage or shed, which is not in close proximity to a dwelling, consideration could still be
          given to installing a consumer unit of non-ferrous construction. The term "not in close
          proximity" is always a moot point and the decision to install a non-ferrous enclosure
          must be supported by a documented risk assessment, which must be appended to the
          Electrical Installation Certificate.


          2.3        Separation of gas installation pipework
                     from the electrical installation
          Where gas installation pipework is not separated from electrical equipment or cables
          by an insulating enclosure, dividing barrier, trunking, or conduit, the following separation
          distances shall be followed:
                  (a) at least 150 mm away from electricity supply equipment, such as metering
                      equipment, main service cut-outs or supplier (main) isolation switches and
                      distribution boards or consumer units;
                  (b) at least 25 mm away from electrical switches, sockets and electricity supply
                      and distribution cables.
          The installation pipework shall not be positioned in a manner that prevents the operation
          of any electrical accessory, i.e. a switch or socket-outlet.
          Note:       Where these spacing requirements are impracticable the pipework should either be sheathed
                      with an electric insulating material rated at 230 V or more, or a panel of electrical insulating
                      material should be interposed.

          The cited distances are quoted within BS 6891:2015 Specification for the installation
          and maintenance of low pressure gas installation pipework of up to 35 mm (R 1114) on

            2.4           Portable generators
551.4.4     It is recognised that generators will be used occasionally as a temporary or short-term
            means of supplying electricity for use; for example:
                    ll>  on a construction site
                    .,.. on sta lls at a street market
                    ll> at an externa l gathering or function attended by the general public, such as a
                         country show.
            Temporary generators can be divided into two classes, i.e. portable and mobile:
                    ll>  portable generators with an electrical output rating of up to 10 kVA are used for
                         small-scale work for short-term use, i.e. less than one day, and
                    .,.. mobile generators are those used for longer periods and can be in excess of
                         10 kVA output.

            This Guide considers three scenarios relating to the use of portable generators; see 2.4.1
            to 2.4.3.

   551    For information relating to the permanent use of generators see lET Guidance Notes 5
          and 7 and Section 551 of BS 7671 :2018.
          Where generators are used to supply concession vehicles, such as burger vans, see
          Section 717 Mobile and Transportable Units of BS 7671 :2018 and lET Guidance Note 7.

          1.4.1 Portable generator isolated from earth
551.4.4   Portable generators ranging in output from 0.2 kVA to 10 kVA single-phase are often
          isolated from Earth, i.e. there is no connection between the chassis and/or earth
          connection of socket-outlet(s) of the unit and the neutral of the generator winding and
          Earth. The ends of the generator winding are brought out to one or more three-pin
          socket-outlets which should conform to BS EN 60309-2. The earth socket-tube of the
          socket-outlet(s) is usually connected internally to the frame of the generator only; see
          Figure 2.4.1.
   413    This arrangement is a form of electrical separation, where basic protection is provided
 418.3    by basic insulation of live parts or by barriers and enclosures, and fault protection is
          provided by simple separation of the separated circuit from other circuits and from Earth.
          The requirements for electrical separation can be found in Section 413 of BS 7671
          where one item of equipment is supplied and Regulation 418.3 where more than one
          item of equipment is supplied by the separated circuit. However, the requirements of
          Regulation 418.3 could prove difficult or impracticable to meet in a typical application of
          a portable generator.
          It is extremely important to note that a portable generator isolated from earth should
          only be used to supply equipment in the following permutations:
                ..,. one or more items of Class II equipment
                ..,. one item of Class I equipment
                ..,. one or more items of Class II and one item of Class I equipment.
          The supply of only Class II equipment, however, is preferable.
          No more than one item of Class I equipment should be supplied at any time as faults can
          be presented as voltages and operatives can provide a path for current flowing between
          exposed-conductive-parts of faulty electrical equipment.

            2.4.2 Portable generator used without reference to the
                         condudive mass of the Earth (floating)
551.4.4     Where more than one item of Class I equipment is to be supplied by a single-phase
            portable generator, it is important to ensure that the earth connections of the socket-
            outlets at the generator are connected to the neutral of the generator winding in addition
            to the chassis or frame of the generator. See Figure 2.4.2.
            Such a configuration will provide a return path for any fault current caused by contact
            between live parts and exposed-conductive-parts of the connected equipment. Note
            that neither of the live conductors of the generator are connected to the conductive
            mass of the Earth. If this method of supply is used, extreme care should be taken
            to ensure that there is no intended or casual interconnection with any other electrical
            system, such as extraneous-conductive-parts or exposed-conductive-parts from other
            electrical systems.
            RCDs providing additional protection at 30 rnA are required for all circuits supplied in
            this manner.

           1.4.3 Portable generator referenced to the condudive
                 mass of the Earth
BS 7430:   Where there are extraneous-conductive-parts or exposed-conductive-parts of other
2011+A1:
           electrical systems present, generator reference earthing, by means of an earth electrode
    2015
           to the conductive mass of the Earth, should be installed. See Figure 2.4.3(i).
           Note that this does not create a n system; the system will be TN-S from the generator,
           the neutral or star point being referenced to the conductive mass of the Earth.
           Where an earth electrode is supplied it will need to be tested by the standard method
           using a proprietary earth electrode resistance tester; see 10.3.5.2.
           Note that an earth fault loop impedance tester cannot be used for this test as the
           earth electrode is not used as a means of earthing, it is used to reference the portable
           generator to the conductive mass of the Earth and does not form part of the earth loop.
           As the earth electrode is used for referencing and not as a means of earthing, its
           resistance should, ideally, be less than 200 0.
   Table   If buried, generator reference earthing and/or bonding conductors should be sized
    54.1   in accordance with Table 54.1 and suitably protected in accordance with Regulation
 543.3.1                                  2
           543.3.1 . For example, a 16 mm conductor would generally be adequate for short-term

          3.1              Types of protective device
          The consumer unit (or distribution board) may contain devices providing:

   433            (a) protection against overload current
   434            (b)      protection against short-circuit current and earth fault current
411.3.2           (c)      automatic disconnection in case of a fault (fault protection)
 415.1            (d)      additional protection (electric shock protection): RCD(s) 30 mA.
421.1.7           (e)      additional protection against fire may also be included (AFDD)
          Functions (a) and (b) are usually carried out by one device, i.e. a fuse or circuit-breaker.

   434    Function (c) is usually carried out by the device performing function (b), except where
          a high value of earth fault loop impedance makes the use of a fuse or circuit-breaker for
          function (c) impracticable (such as a TT system), in which case an RCD has to be used.
   434    An RCBO, being a unit with a combined circuit-breaker and RCD, will carry out functions
   411    (a) to (d).

Appx3     3.2               Protection against overload current
 533.1
          Protection against overload current will be provided by the use of any of the following
          devices:

                  ..,..     fuses to BS 88-2, (BS EN 60269-2) BS 88-3, BS 88-6, BS 1361 and BS 3036
                  ..,..     miniature circuit-breakers to BS 3871-1 types 1, 2 and 3
                  ..,..     circuit-breakers to BS EN 60898 types B, C and D, and
                  ..,..     residual current circuit-breakers with integral overcurrent protection (RCBOs) to
                            BS EN 61009 series and BS EN 62423.


          3.3               Protection against short-circuit current and
                            earth fault current
          When a consumer unit to BS EN 61439-3:2012 or BS 5486: Part 13 or a fuseboard
          having fuselinks to BS 88-2 (BS EN 60269-2) or BS 88-6 or BS 1361 is used, then
          protection against short-circuit current and earth fault current will be provided by that
          particular overcurrent protective device.
          Note:           For other protective devices the breaking capacity must be adequate for the prospective fault
                          current at their point of installation.

              3.4           Protection against electric shock
              3.4.1 Automatic disconnection of supply
     411      Automatic disconnection of supply (ADS) is the most the common method of protection
   411.1      against electric shock. There are two elements to automatic disconnection of supply,
              basic protection and fault protection.

   411.2      3.4.1.1        Basic protection
   411.1      Basic protection is the physical barrier between persons/livestock and a live part.
    416       Examples of basic protection are:
   416.1               ..,. electrical insulation
   416.2               ll> enclosures and barriers.

521.10.1      It follows that single-core non-sheathed insulated conductors must be protected by
              conduit or trunking and be terminated within a suitable enclosure.
 415.1.1      A 30 rnA RCD may be provided to give additional protection against contact with live
 415.1.2      parts but must not be used as primary protection.

   411.3      3.4.1.2       Fault protection
   411.1      Fault protection comprises:

411.3.1.1             ..,. protective earthing,
411.3.1.2             ll> protective equipotential bonding, and
 411.3.2              ll> automatic disconnection in case of a fault.

              Fault protection works by limiting the magnitude and duration of voltages that may appear
              under earth fault conditions between simultaneously accessible exposed-conductive-
              parts of equipment and between them and extraneous-conductive-parts or earth.

              3.4.2 other methods of protedion against eledric shock
 410.3.3      In addition to automatic disconnection of supply, BS 767 1 recognises other methods of
              protection against electric shock.

     414      3.4.3         SELV and PELV
              SELV
              Separated extra-low voltage (SELV) systems:
   414.3              ll>   are supplied from isolated safety sources such as a safety isolating transformer
                            to BS EN 61558-2-6 orBS EN 61558-2-8
                      ll>   have no live part connected to earth or the protective conductor of another
                            system
 414.4.1              ll>   have basic insulation from other SELV and PELV circuits
                      ll>   have double or reinforced insulation or basic insulation plus earthed metallic
                            screening from LV circuits

   414.4.1   Protective extra-low voltage (PELV) systems must meet all the requirements for SELV,
             except that the circuits are not electrically separated from earth.

  414.4.5    For SELV and PELV systems, basic protection need not be provided if voltages do not
             exceed those given in Table 3.4.3.

             3.5.1          Standard circuits
             For the standard final circuits given in Section 7 of this Guide, the correct disconnection
             time is obtained for the protective devices by limiting the maximum circuit lengths.

Table 41.1   3.5.2          Disconnection times -TN systems
411.3.2.2    A disconnection time of not more than 0.4 s is required for final circuits:
                      ll> 63 A with one or more socket-outlets
                      ll> 32 A when supplying only fixed equipment

411.3.2.3    A disconnection time of not more than       5   s is permitted for:
                      ll> final circuits exceeding 32 A, and
                      ll> distribution circuits.

411.3.2.2    The required disconnection times for installations forming part of a TT system can,
             except in the most exceptional circumstances outside the scope of this Guide, only be
             achieved by protecting every circuit with an RCD, hence, a time of not more than 0.2 s
             is required for final circuits:

               3.6             Residual current devices (RCDs)
               RCD is the generic term for a device that operates when the residual current in the circuit
               reaches a predetermined value. The RCD is, therefore, the main component in an RCCB
               (residual current operated circuit-breaker without integral overcurrent protection) or
               one of the functions of an RCBO (residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral
               overcurrent protection).

               3.6.1 Protedion by RCDs
               RCDs are required for:

   411.4               (a) fault protection where the earth fault loop impedance is too high to meet
   411.5                       the required disconnection time, for exam ple, where the distributor does not

               3.6.2 Omission of RCD protedion
 411.3.3       3.6.2.1         Specific cases
               RCDs for additional requirements for socket-outlets can be omitted in non-domestic
               premises, where a documented risk assessment determines that RCD protection is not
               necessary. The risk assessment must be appended to the certificate issued for the work.
               See 3.6.2.2.
               Cables installed on the surface do not specifically require RCD protection; however, RCD
   411.4       protection may be required for other reasons, for example, for fault protection where the
   411.5       earth fault loop impedance is such that the disconnection time for an overcurrent device
               cannot be met.

411.3.3   3.6.2.2   Risk assessment and the omission of additional requirements by RCDs for
                    socket-outlets
          In non-domestic premises, BS 7671:2018 permits RCDs, where usually provided
          for additional protection to socket-outlets, to be omitted where a documented risk
          assessment determines that the risk to users and those in the vicinity is sufficiently low
          and, hence, RCD protection is not necessary.
411.3.3   The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 puts the responsibility
Note 2    for carrying out risk assessments onto (as applicable) the persons responsible for the
          operations or work activity. The risk assessment should consider the frequency of use,
          the environment, the equipment to be connected, the skill level of the person using the
          equipment and the socket-outlet and the persons who will have access to the area when
          the equipment is in operation, amongst many other factors.
          The intention is that the omission of RCDs for additiona l protection to socket-outlets
          should be only as a last resort and certainly not for implementation in domestic premises.
          Note that the risk assessment, like all risk assessments, will need to be revisited at
          pertinent intervals to assess any change in circumstances, i.e. change of use/change of
          ownership or when a periodic inspection is undertaken and must be appended to the
          Electrical Installation Certificate EICR.

          3.6.3 Applications of RCDs
   314    Installations are required to be divided into circuits to avoid hazards and minimize
          inconvenience in the event of a fault and to take account of danger that might arise from
          the failure of a single circuit, such as a lighting circuit.
          The following scenarios show different methods of providing RCD protection within
          installations. Note that, for clarity, earthing and bonding connections are not shown.

       Single RCBOs protect each outgoing circuit and the risk of the busbar (connecting
       the supply side of each RCBO) becoming loose and making contact with the ferrous
       enclosure is minimal. The use of RCBOs will minimize inconvenience in the event of a
       fault and is applicable to all systems.

The division of an installation into two parts with separate 30 mA RCCBs will ensure
that part of the installation will remain on supply in the event of a fault. Generally, this
is not suitable for an installation forming part of a TT system as there is insufficient fault
protection of the single insulated conductors which connect the load side of the double-
pole main switch to the supply side of the RCCBs.

The three-way division of an installation can provide ways unprotected by RCDs for, say,
fire systems and for two separate 30 mA RCCBs to ensure that part of the installation
will remain on supply in the event of a fault. Unprotected circuits will usually need to be
installed in earthed metal conduit or wired with ea rthed metal-sheathed cables. This is
not suitable for an installation forming part of a TT system as there is insufficient fault
protection of the single insulated conductors which connect the load side of the double-
pole main switch to the supply side of the RCCBs.

3.6.3.2   RCBOs
The use of RCBOs will minimize inconvenience in the event of a fault and is applicable
to all systems. See Figu re 3.6.3(i).
Such a consumer unit arrangement also easily allows individual circuits, such as to
specifically labelled socket-outlets or fire alarms, to be protected by a circuit-breaker
without RCD protection. Such circuits will usually need to be installed in earthed metal
conduit or wired with earthed metal-sheathed cables.

    534       3.7          Surge protective devices (SPDs)
              3.7.1        Overview
131 .6 .2     Electrical installations and connected equipment can be severely affected by lightning
              activity during thunderstorms or from electrical switching events.
  GN 1        For more information, see lET Guidance Note 1.
443.6.2       Damage can occur when the surge or transient overvoltage, as the result of lightning or
  Table       electrical switching, exceeds the impulse withstand voltage rating of electrical equipment
 443.2        - the levels of which are defined in Table 443.2 of BS 7671:2018.

              Surges from electrical switching events are created when large inductive loads, such as
              motors or air conditioning units, switch off and release stored energy which dissipates as
              a transient overvoltage. Switching surges are, in general, not as severe as lightning surges
              but are more repetitive and can reduce equipment lifespan.
              Overvoltages of atmospheric origin, i.e. created by lightning events, in particular, can
              present a risk of fire and electric shock owing to a dangerous flashover.

   443                .,. Section 443 of BS 7671 :2018 has requirements for the protection of persons,
                          livestock and property from injury and damage as a consequence of overvoltage
    534               .,. Section 534 has requirements for the selection and installation of surge
                          protective devices.
              Note:        Section 534 applies to AC power circuits only. When the need for power SPDs is identified,
                           additional SPDs on other services such as telecommunications lines and equipment is also
                           recommended. See BS EN 62305 and BS EN 61643.

              Note:        Some electronic equipment may have protection levels lower than Category I of Table 443.2.

              Note:        BS 7671:2018 does not specify requirements for protection against transient overvoltages
                           due to direct or nearby lightning strokes on the structure. For risk management for protection
                           against transient overvoltages due to direct or nearby lightning strokes on the structure, see BS
                           EN 62305-2.

              3.7.2 Arrangements for protedion against overvoltages
       443    Protection according to Section 443 can only be achieved if transient overvoltages are
       534    limited to values lower than those given in Table 443.2, requiring the correct selection
              and installation of suitable SPDs.

              3.7.2.1       Where SPD protection may not be required
      443.1   Protection against overvoltages of atmospheric origin is not required in the following
Table 443.2   circumstance but the rated impulse withstand voltage of equipment must meet the
              requirements of Table 443.2 of BS 7671:2018:
     443.4            ll>   for single dwelling units where the total value of the installation and equipment
                            therein, does not justify such protection and the consequential losses are
                            tolerable.

     443.4    3.7.2.2       Where SPD protection is required
              Protection against transient overvoltages shall be provided where the consequence
              caused by overvoltage:
                      (a) results in serious injury to, or loss of, human life, (e.g. hospitals, care homes,
                          home dialysis equipment)
                      (b) results in interruption of public services and/or damage to cultural heritage,
                          (e.g. data centres, heritage status buildings like museums and castles)
                      (c) results in interruption of commercial or industrial activity (e.g. banks, hotels,
                          supermarkets, industrial plants, farms)
                      (d) affects a large number of collocated individuals (e.g. offices, universities,
                          schools, residential tower blocks)
              For all other cases than above a risk assessment to determine the Calculated Risk
              Level CRL shall be conducted to 443.5 (see Appendix lET Guidance Note 1 for further
              information).
              Note:         BS EN 62305·2 Protection against lightning risk assessment method must be used for high
                            risk installations such as nuclear or chemical sites where the consequences of transient
                            overvoltages could lead to explosions, harmful chemical or radioactive emissions thus
                            affecting the environment.

           3.7.3 Types of SPD protedion
   534.1   For the protection of AC power circuits, SPDs are allocated a type number:

   534.4          Ji>   Type 1 SPDs are only used where there is a risk of direct lightning current and,
                        typically, are installed at the origin of the installation
                  Ji>   Type 2 SPDs are used at distribution boards
                  Ji>   Type 3 SPDs are used near terminal equipment.
           See also Table 3.7.3.
Appendix   Combined Type SPDs are classified with more than one Type, e.g. Type 1 & 2, Type 2
     16    & 3, and can provide both lightning current with overvoltage protection in addition to
           protection between all conductor combinations (or modes of protection) within a single
           unit. Combined Type SPDs provide high surge current handling combined with better
           overvoltage protection levels (Up) - the latter being a performance parameter of an SPD.

           must be coordinated to ensure the correct type of protection is installed where required;
           see Figure 3.7.4.
           SPD protection should be coordinated as follows:
                  Ji>   choose the correct type of SPD for the installation and site in the correct
                        location

          as possible, to minimize additive inductive voltage drops across the conductors. The total

             3. 7.6 Methods of connection
534.4. 3     Primarily, the installation of SPDs must follow the manufacturer's instructions but
             minimum SPD connections at the origin of the electrical supply are usually made as
             those shown in Figure 3.7.6(i) (TN-C-S, TN-S, TI) and Figure 3.7.6(ii) (TI - SPDs
             upstream of RCD):
             Type 1 SPDs should be installed upstream from any RCD to avoid unwanted tripping.
             Where this cannot be avoided, the RCD should be of the time-delayed or S-type.

4 21.1. 7   3.8 Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDD)
  537.6     The use of AFDDs is recommended as additional protection against fire in AC final
            circuits. Such protection is not offered by circuit-breakers, fuses and RCDs as AFDDs are
            designed to detect low level hazardous arcing that circuit breakers, fuses and RCDs are
            not designed to detect. AFDDs detect series and parallel arcs which, for instance, can
            occur within damaged cables and loose connections.
            AFDDs may be provide as :
                    (a) one single device, comprising an AFD unit and opening means and intended to
                       be connected in series with a suitable short circuit protective device declared
                       by the manufacturer complying with one or more of the following standards
                       BS EN 60898-1, BS EN 61009-1 orBS EN 60269 series.
                    (b) one single device, comprising an AFD unit integrated in a protective device
                       complying with one or more of the following standards BS EN 60898-1, BS EN
                       61008-1, BS EN 61009-1 orBS EN 62423.
                    (c) an AFD unit (add-on module) and a declared protective device, intended to
                       be assembled on site.
                    AFDDs shall be installed at the origin of the circuit to be protected.

             4.1        Protective earthing
             The purpose of protective earthing is to ensure that, in the event of a fault, such as
             between a line conductor and an exposed-conductive-part or circuit protective conductor,
             sufficient current flows to operate the protective device, i.e. fuse to blow, circuit-breaker
             to operate or RCD to operate, in the required time.

   411.4.2   Every exposed-conductive-part (a conductive part of equipment that can be touched
   411.5.1   and which is not a live part but which may become live under fault conditions) shall
             be connected by a protective conductor to the main earthing terminal and, hence, the
             means of earthing for the installation.


             4.2        Legal requirements
   ESQCR     ESQCR requires that a distributor of electricity makes the supply neutral conductor or
   512665    protective conductor available for t he connection of the consumer's protective conductor
ESQCR (NI)   where it can be reasonably concluded that such a connection is appropriate. Such a
     2012
             connection may be deemed inappropriate where there is a risk of the loss of the PEN
   No. 381
             conductor, for example, where bare overhead low voltage distribution cables supply a
             rural building. In such cases, an installation earth electrode must be provided and the
             installation will then form part of a TT system.

             Essentially, permission to connect the consumer's protective conductor to the
             distributor's neutral can be denied to new installations but, where permission is granted,
             the distributor has a responsibility to maintain the connection.
             Note:      For some rural installations supplied by a PME arrangement, it may be pertinent to install an
                        additional earth electrode to mitigate the effects of a PEN conductor becoming open-circuit;
                        see lET Guidance Note 5.



             4.3        Main protedive bonding
             (Figures 2.1(i) to 2.1( iii))

             The purpose of protective bonding is to reduce the voltages between the various
             exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts of an installation, during a
             fault to earth and in the event of a fault on the distributor's network.

                                                                      ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology

411.3.1.2     Main protective bonding conductors are required to connect extraneous-conductive-
   Part 2     parts to the main earthing terminal of the installation. An extraneous-conductive-part
              is a conductive part, such as a metal pipe, liable to introduce earth potential into the
              installation or building. It is common, particularly under certain fault conditions on the
              LV supply network, for a potential to exist between true earth, i.e. the conductive mass
              of the Earth and the earth of the electrical system. Therefore, buried metallic parts that
              enter the building are to be connected to the main earthing terminal of the electrical
              installation.
              Examples of extraneous-conductive-parts are:
                      (a) metallic installation pipes
                      (b) metallic gas installation pipes
                      (c) other installation pipework, for example, heating oil
                      (d) exposed structural steelwork of the building where rising from the ground
                      (e) lightning protection systems (where required by BS EN 62305).

              However, metallic pipes entering the building having an insulating section at their point
              of entry need not be connected to the main earthing terminal.
              Any internal metallic pipework that may have been buried in the ground for convenience,
              for example, central heating pipework cast into the concrete or buried in the floor screed
              of a floor at ground level, would normally be considered to be extraneous-conductive-
              parts and should be connected to the main earthing terminal.


              4.4           Earthing conductor and main protective
                            bonding condudor cross-sectional areas
              The minimum cross-sectional areas (csa) required for the earthing conductor and main

             Note that:
  543.2.4                 (a) only copper conductors should be used; copper covered aluminium
                              conductors or aluminium conductors or structural steel can only be used if
                              special precautions outside the scope of this Guide are taken
  544.1.2                 (b) where practicable, protective bonding connections to the gas, water, oil, etc.,
                              service should be within 600 mm of the service meter, or at the point of entry
                              to the building if the service meter is external and must be on the consumer's
                              side before any branch pipework and after any insulating section in the service.
                              The connection must be made to hard pipework, not to soft or flexible meter
                              connections
  542.3.2                 (c) the connection must be made using clamps (to BS 951) and be suitably
                              protected against corrosion at the point of contact.


             4.5              Main protedive bonding of plastic services
             There is no requirement to main bond an incoming service where the incoming service
             pipe is plastic, for example, where yellow is used for natural gas and blue for potable
             water.

                                                                                                       On-Site Guide       49

  4
              Where there is a plastic incoming service and a metal installation within the premises,
              main bonding is recommended unless it has been confirmed that any metallic pipework
              within the building is not introducing Earth potential (see 4.3).
411.3.1.2     Metallic pipes entering the building and having an insulating section;
                   - of no less than 100 mm in length, and
                   - within 300 mm of the point of entry
              need not be connected to the protective equipotential bonding.


              4.6           Supplementary bonding
              The purpose of supplementary bonding is to reduce the voltage between the various
              exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts of a location during a fault
              to earth.
              Note:        Where a required disconnection time cannot be achieved, supplementary bonding must
                           be applied, however, this is outside the scope of this Guide. See Regulation 411.3.2.5 and
                           Guidance Note l.

              The cross-sectional area required for supplementary bonding conductors is given in
              Table 4.6.

    415.2    Supplementary equipotential bonding is required in some of the locations and
             installations falling within the scope of Part 7 of BS 7671.
             If the installation meets the requirements of BS 7671:2018 for earthing and bonding,
             there is no specific requirement for supplementary equipotential bonding of:
                     .,.. kitchen pipes, sinks or draining boards
                     .,.. metallic boiler pipework
                     .,.. metallic furniture in kitchens
                     .,.. metallic pipes to wash-hand basins and WCs
701.415.2            .,.. locations containing a bath or shower, providing the cond itions of Regulation
                          701.415.2 are met.
             Note:          Metallic waste pipes deemed to be extraneous-conductive-parts must be connected by main
                            protective bonding conductors to the main earthing terminal; see also 4.3.



             4.8            Supplementary bonding of plastic pipe
                            installations
             Supplementary bonding is not required to metallic parts supplied by plastic pipes, for
             example, radiators, kitchen sinks or bathroom taps.


             4.9            Earth electrode
542.1.2.3    This is connected to the main earthing terminal by the earthing conductor and provides
             part of the earth fault loop path for an installation forming part of a n system; see Figure
             2.1 (iii).
Table 41.5   It is recommended that the earth fault loop impedance for an installation forming part of
   Note 2    a n system does not exceed 200 0.
  542.2.6    Metallic gas or water utility or other metallic service pipes are not to be used as an earth
             electrode, although they must be bonded if they are extraneous-conductive-parts; see
             also 4.3.
             Note:          Regulation 542.2.6 permits the use of privately owned water supply pipework for use as an
                            earth electrode where precautions are taken against its removal and it has been considered for
                            such use. This provision will not apply to an installation within a dwelling.

132.15.201   5.1.1     Requirement
             Means of isolation should be provided:

                   (a) at the origin of the installation
                       A main linked switch or circuit-breaker should be provided as a means of
                       isolation and of interrupting the supply on load.
                       For single-phase household and similar installations, the main switch may be
                       operated by unskilled persons, a double-pole device must be used for both TT
                       and TN systems.
                       For a three-phase supply to an installation forming part of a TT system, an
                       isolator must interrupt the line and neutral conductors. In a TN-S or TN-C-S
                       system only the line conductors need be interrupted.
    462.3
                   (b) for every circuit
                       Other than at the origin of the installation, every circuit or group of circuits
                       that may have to be isolated without interrupting the supply to other circuits
                        should be provided with its own isolating device. The device must switch all
                       live conductors in a TT system and all line conductors in a TN system.
                   (c) for every item of equipment
                   (d) for every motor
                       Every fixed electric motor should be provided with a readily accessible and
                        easily operated device to switch off the motor and all associated equipment
                       including any automatic circuit-breaker. The device must be so placed as to
                       prevent danger.

 537.3.2.3   The position of the contacts of the isolator must either be externally visible or be clearly,
             positively and reliably indicated.

   537.2.4   The device must be designed or installed to prevent unintentional or inadvertent closure.
             Each device used for isolation must be clearly identified by position or durable marking
             to indicate the installation or circuit that it isolates.

537.3.2.3     If it is installed remotely from the equipment to be isolated, the device must be capable
  514.1.1     of being secured in the OPEN position.
              Guidance on the selection of devices for isolation is given in Appendix J.


     464      5.2          Switching off for mechanical maintenance
   464.1      A means of switching off for mechanical maintenance is required where mechanical
              maintenance may involve a risk of injury - for example, from mechanical movement of
              machinery or hot items when replacing lamps.

   464.2      The means of switching off for mechanical maintenance must be able to be made
              secure to prevent electrically powered equipment from becoming unintentionally started
              during the mechanical maintenance, unless the means of switching off is continuously
              under the control of the person performing the maintenance.
              Each device for switching off for mechanical maintenance must:

537.3.2.2             (a) where practicable, be inserted in the main supply circuit
537.3.2.2             (b) be capable of switching the full load current
537.3.2.3             (c) be manually operated
537.3.2.3             (d) have either an externally visible contact gap or a clearly and reliably indicated
337.3.2.4                 OFF position. An indicator light should not be relied upon
   464.2              (e) be designed and/or installed so as to prevent inadvertent or unintentional
                          switching on
537.3.2.4             (f) be installed and durably marked so as to be readily identifiable and convenient
                          for use.

537.3.2.2     A plug and socket-outlet or similar device of rating not exceeding 16 A may be used for
              switching off for mechanical maintenance.


     465      5.3          Emergency switching
   465.1      An emergency switch is to be provided for any part of an installation where it may be
              necessary to control the supply in order to remove an unexpected danger.

   461.2      Where there is a risk of electric shock the emergency switch is to disconnect all live
              conductors, except in three-phase TN-S and TN-C-S systems, where the neutral need
              not be switched.

   465.3      The means of emergency switching must act as directly as possible on the appropriate
              supply conductors and the arrangement must be such that one single action only will
              interrupt the appropriate supply.

537.3.3.3     A plug and socket-outlet or similar device must not be selected as a device for emergency
              switching.
              An emergency switch must be:

537.3.3.2            (a) capable of cutting off the full load current, taking account of stalled motor
                         currents where appropriate

                        with a contrasting background
537.3.3.6           (d) readily accessible at the place where danger might occur and, where appropriate,
                        at any additional remote position from which that danger can be removed
537.3.3.7           (e) of the latching type or capable of being restrained in the 'OFF' or 'STOP'
                        position, unless both the means of operation and re-energizing are under the
                        control of the same person. The release of an emergency switching device
                        must not re-energize the relevant part of the installation; it must be necessary
                        to take a further action, such as pushing a 'start' button
537.3.3.6           (f) so placed and durably marked so as to be readily identifiable and convenient
                        for its intended use.


    463     5.4         Functional switching
 537.3.1
 463.1.1    A switch must be installed in each part of a circuit which may require to be controlled
            independently of other parts of the installation.

 463.1.2    Switches must not be installed in the neutral conductor alone.

 463.1. 3   All current-using equipment requiring control shall be controlled by a switch.

537.3.1.1   Off-load isolators, fuses and links must not be used for functional switching.
            Note:      Table 537.4 of BS 7671:2018 permits the use of circuit-breakers for functional switching
                       purposes but, in each case, the manufacturer should be consulted to establish suitability.


   537.4    5.5         Firefighter's switch
 537.4.2    A firefighter's switch must be provided to disconnect the supply to any exterior electrical
            installation operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage, for example, a neon sign or any
            interior discharge lighting installation operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage.

           The following durable labels are to be securely fixed on or adjacent to installed equipment.


           6.1       Retention of a dangerous electrical charge
416.2.5    If, behind a barrier or within an enclosure, an item of equipment such as a capacitor is
  462.4    installed which may retain a dangerous electrical charge after it has been switched off,
           a warning label must be provided. Small capacitors such as those used for arc extinction
           and for delaying the response of relays, etc., are not considered dangerous.
           Note:     Unintentional contact is not considered dangerous if the voltage resulting from static charge
                     falls below 120 V DC in less than 5 s after disconnection from the power supply.



           6.2       Where the operator cannot observe the
                     operation of switchgear and controlgear
 514.1.1   Except where there is no possibility of confusion, a label or other suitable means of
           identification must be provided to indicate the purpose of each item of switchgear
           and controlgear. Where the operator cannot observe the operation of switchgear and
           controlgear and where this might lead to danger, a suitable indicator complying, where
           applicable, with BS EN 60073 and BS EN 60447, should be fixed in a position visible to
           the operator.


           6.3       Unexpected presence of nominal voltage
                     exceeding 230 V
514.10.1   Where a nominal voltage exceeding 230 V to earth exists and it would not normally be
           expected, a warning label stating the maximum voltage present must be provided where
           it can be seen before gaining access to live parts.

           Note that a TN/TT, i.e. earthed neutral, three-phase system with 400 V between line
           conductors will have nominal voltage of 230 V to earth, therefore, a warning notice will
           not be required for such systems.

             6.5           Purpose of switchgear and controlgear
 514.1.1     Unless there is no possibility of confusion, a label indicating the purpose of each item of
             switchgear and controlgear must be fixed on or adjacent to the gear. It may be necessary
             to label the item controlled, in addition to its controlgear.


             6.6           Identification of protective devices
514.8.1      A protective device, for example, a fuse or circuit-breaker, must be arranged and identified
             so that the circuit protected may be easily recognised.


             6.7           Identification of isolators
537.2 .7     Where it is not immediately apparent, all isolating devices must be clearly identified
             by position or durable marking. The location of each disconnector or isolator must be

       7.2          Standard final circuits
       7.2.1        Grouping of circuit cables
       The tables assume heating (including water heating) cables are not grouped.
       For cables of household or similar installations (heating and water heating excepted), if
       the following rules are followed, derating for grouping is not necessary:
               (a) Cables are not grouped, that is, they are separated by at least two cable
                   diameters when installed under thermal insulation, namely installation methods
                    100, 101, 102 and 103.
               (b) Cables clipped direct (including in cement or plaster) are clipped side by side
                   in one layer and separated by at least one cable diameter.
               (c) Cables above ceilings are clipped to joists as per installation methods 100 to
                   103 of Table 4A2 of BS 767 1.
       For other groupings, ambient temperatures higher than 30 oc or enclosure in thermal
       insulation, cable csa will need to be increased as per Appendix F of this Guide.

       7.2.2 Socket-outlet circuits
       The length represents the total ring cable loop length and does not include any spurs.
       As a rule of thumb for rings, unfused spur lengths should not exceed    1/     the cable length
                                                                                  8
       from the spur to the furthest point of the ring.
       The total number of fused spurs is unlimited but the number of non-fused spurs is not to
       exceed the total number of socket-outlets and items of stationary equipment connected
       directly in the circuit.
       A non-fused spur feeds only one single or twin socket-outlet or one permanently
       connected item of electrical equipment. Such a spur is connected to a circuit at the
       terminals of socket-outlets or at junction boxes or at the origin of the circuit in the
       distribution board.
       A fused spur is connected to the circuit through a fused connection unit, the rating of
       the fuse in the unit not exceeding that of the cable forming the spur and, in any event,
       not exceeding 13 A. The number of socket-outlets which may be supplied by a fused
       spur is unlimited.
       The circuit is assumed to have a load of 20 A at the furthest point and the balance to
       the rating of the protective device evenly distributed. (For a 32 A device this equates to
       a load of 26 A at the furthest point.)

       7.2.3 Light.ing circuits
       A maximum voltage drop of 3 per cent of the 230 V nominal supply voltage has been
       allowed in the circuits; see Appendix F.
       The circuit is assumed to have a load equal to the rated current (In) of the circuit
       protective device, evenly distributed along the circuit. Where this is not the case, circuit

                                                                                                                           7
               lengths will need to be reduced where voltage drop is the limiting factor, or halved
               where load is all at the extremity.
               The most onerous installation condition acceptable for the load and device rating is
               presumed when calculating the limiting voltage drop. If the installation conditions are
               not the most onerous allowed (see column 4 of Table 7.1(i)) the voltage drop will not
               be as great as presumed in the table.

               7.2.4 RCDs
               Where circuits have residual current protection, the limiting factor is often the maximum
               loop impedance that will result in operation of the overcurrent device within 5 seconds
               for a short-circuit (line to neutral) fault. (See note 1 to Table 7.1 (i) and limiting factor
               sc.)

               7.2.5 Requirement for RCDs
               RCDs are required:
      411.5            (a) where the earth fault loop impedance is too high to provide the required
                             disconnection, for example, where the distributor does not provide a
                             connection to the means of earthing- TT earthing arrangement
 411.3.3{i)            (b)   for socket-outlets with a rated current not exceeding 32 A
    411.3.4            (c)   for lighting circuits in domestic (household) premises
701.411.3.3            (d)   for all circuits of locations containing a bath or shower or passing through
                             zones 1 and/or 2 not serving the location
 411.3.3{ii)           (e)   for circuits supplying mobile equipment not exceeding 32 A for use outdoors
 522.6.202             (f)   for cables without earthed metallic covering installed in walls or partitions at
                             a depth of less than 50 mm and not protected by earthed steel conduit or
                             similar
 522.6.203             (g)   for cables without earthed metallic covering installed in walls or partitions
                             with metal parts (not including screws or nails) and not protected by earthed
                             steel conduit or the like.
               Note:         Metallic capping does not meet the requirements for mechanical protection as required
                             by 522.6.204. Metallic capping is used to protect the cables during the installation
                             process and, once plastered over, does not provide any further protection. Similarly,
                             metallic capping would not meet the requirements for 522.6.204, (ii) or (iii) and would
                             not satisfy the requirements of BS 7671 for a protective conductor.
                             A single layer of steel with a minimum thickness of 3 mm is generally considered to
                             provide sufficient mechanical protection against penetration by nails, screws and the
                             like in accordance with Regulation 522.6.204(iv), except where shot-fired nails are
                             likely to be used.

               Omission of RCD protection

    411.3.3           (a) in non-domestic premises, RCD additional protection for socket-outlets with
                             a rated current not exceeding 32 A can be omitted where a documented risk
                             assessment determines that such protection is not necessary (i.e. the risk to
                             users is sufficiently low). This dispensation does not apply for an installation
                             in a dwelling.

                                                                                                      On-Site Guide        77
                                                                         © The Institution of Engineering and Technology

411.5.2     Cables installed on the surface do not specifically require RCD protection, however, RCD
            protection may be required for other reasons, such as, where the installation forms part
            of a n system and the earth fault loop impedance values for the overcurrent protective
            device cannot be met.

            7.1.6        n systems
            For TT systems the figures for TN-C-S systems, with RCDs, may be used provided that:
                    (a) the circuit is protected by an RCD to BS 4293, BS EN 61008, BS EN 61009
                        or BS EN 62423 with a rated residual operating current not exceeding that
                        required for its circuit position,
                    (b) the total earth fault loop impedance is verified as being less than 200 0 , and
                    (c) a device giving both overload and short-circuit protection is installed in the
                        circuit. This may be an RCBO or a combination of a fuse or circuit-breaker with
                        an RCCB.

            7.1.7 Choice of proted.ive device
            The selection of protective device depends upon:
                    (i) prospective fault current
                    (ii) circuit load characteristics
                    (iii) cable current-carrying capacity
                    (iv) disconnection time limit.
            Whilst these factors have generally been allowed for in the standard final circuits in
            Table 7.1 (i), the following additional guidance is given:

            i       Prospective fault current
434.5.1     If a protective device is to operate safely, its rated short-circuit capacity must be not less
            than the prospective fault current at the point where it is installed. See Table 7.2.7(i).
  313.1     The distributor needs to be consulted as to the prospective fault current at the origin of
            the installation. Except for London and some other major city centres, the maximum fault
            current for 230 V single-phase supplies up to 100 A will not exceed 16 kA. In general,
            the fault current is unlikely to exceed 16.5 kA.

*Two short-circuit capacities are defined in BS EN 60898 and BS EN 61009:
      Ill>   len the rated short-circuit capacity (marked on the device).
      Ill>   les the service short-circuit capacity.
The difference between the two is the condition of the circuit-breaker after manufacturer's
testing.
      Ill>   len is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely, although the
             breaker may no longer be usable.
      Ill>   les is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely without loss
             of performance.
The 101 value (in amperes) is normally marked on the device in a rectangle, for example,
~OOOIA and for the majority of applications the prospective fault current at the terminals
of the circuit-breaker should not exceed this value.
For domestic installations the prospective fault current is unlikely to exceed 6 kA, up to
which value the len will equal lcs.

  528    7.4        Proximity to electrical and other services
528.3    Electrical and all other services must be protected from any harmful mutual effects
         foreseen as likely under conditions of normal service. For example, cables should not be
         in contact with or run alongside hot pipes.

         7.4.1      Segregation of Band I and Band II circuits
528.1    Band I (extra-low voltage) circuits must not be contained within the same wiring system
Part 2   (for example, trunking) as Band II (low voltage) circuits unless:
           (a) every cable is insulated for the highest voltage present, or
           (b) each conductor of a multicore cable is insulated for the highest voltage present, or
           (c) the cables are installed in separate compartments, or
           (d) the cables fixed to a cable tray are separated by a partition, or
           (e) for a multicore cable, they are separated by an earthed metal screen of equivalent
               current-carrying capacity to that of the largest Band II circuit.
         Definitions of voltage bands
                 .,. Band I circuit: Circuit that is nominally extra-low voltage, i.e. not exceeding
                      50 V AC or 120 V DC For example, SELV, PELV, telecommunications, data and
                     signalling
                 .,. Band II circuit: Circuit that is nominally low voltage, i.e. 51 to 1000 V AC and
                     121 to 1500 v DC.
528.1,   Note:     Fire alarm and emergency lighting circuits must be separated from other cables and from
Note 2             each other, in compliance with BS 5839 and BS 5266 respectively.


         7.4.1 Proximity to communications cables
528.2    An adequate separation between telecommunication wiring (Band I) and electric
         power and lighting (Band II) circuits must be maintained. This is to prevent mains
         voltage appearing in telecommunication circuits with consequent danger to personnel.
         BS 6701:2004 recommends that the minimum separation distances given in Tables
         7.4.2(i) and 7.4.2(ii) should be maintained.

            7.4.4 lndudion loops
            A particular form of harmful effect may occur when an electrical installation shares the
            space occupied by a hearing aid induction loop.

           Under these circumstances, if line and neutral conductors or switch feeds and switch
           wires are not run close together, there may be interference with the induction loop.
           This can occur when a conventional two-way lighting circuit is installed. This effect can
           be reduced by connecting as shown in Figure 7.4.4.

             7.6             Eledrical supplies to furniture
             Where electrical equipment is installed within purpose-built items of furniture, such as
             cupboards, shop displays or lecterns, and supplied from a plug and socket arrangement,
             no specific standard exists for such installations, therefore guidance is given here which,
             essentially, follows the principles of BS 7671 . For electrical systems in office furniture and
             educational furniture, BS 6396:2008+A1 :2015 currently exists for installations which are
             supplied via a 13 A BS 1363 plug.
             The following points should be adhered to:
 415.1.1              ..,.   socket-outlets supplying items of furniture must be protected by an RCD
                             providing additional protection at 30 mA
                      ..,.   cables of Band I and Band II circuits to be kept apart as far as is reasonably
                             practicable; see also 7.4.1
                      ..,.   cables of Band I and Band II circuits, which are often hidden beneath the
                             desk, should be sufficiently mechanically protected from damage caused by
                             movement of chairs, storage of materials and the movement of feet and legs
                     ..,.    cable management systems or containment, such as conduit or trunking,
                             should be installed to allow the safe routing, protection and separation of
                             cables through the equipment
                     ..,.    long-term use of multi-gang extension leads should be avoided by installing
                             a sufficient number of socket-outlets to supply the equipment to be used;
                             employers should not allow ad hoc solutions to be created by users. See also
                             BS 6396:2008
                     ..,.    ensure that cables are sufficiently protected and cannot become trapped or
                             damaged where desks are designed to be extended or altered to suit different
                             activities or users.
543.2.1      There is no general requirement to ensure electrical continuity across the metallic frame
543.2.6      of an item of furniture unless the frame has been designed to be used as a protective
             conductor.
             Where luminaires are installed in display stands, one of two methods of protection
             against electric shock must be used:
  559.8              (a) SELV or PELV
    414              (b) protected by a 30 mA RCD
  415.1


521.10.1     7•7             Trunking installations
             All current-carrying single core non-sheathed cables must be enclosed within conduit,
             ducting or trunking having at least the degree of protection IPXXD or IP4X and covers
             must only be removable by the use of a tool. It is very important that the IP rating of
             IPXXD or IP4X is maintained where site-fabricated joints are utilised.

   132.16   7 •8       Additions and alterations
421.1.201
            Where an addition or alteration is required, there are a number of issues to keep in mind.
            The designer/installer takes responsibility for all aspects of the installation relevant to the
            planned work. The following elements must be adequate for the altered circumstances:
                   (a) the rating of the existing equipment is suitable for the addition or alteration,
                       including the distributor's equipment and metering equipment
                   (b) the existing equipment is suitable for continued use, including the distributor's
                       equipment and metering equipment
                   (c) earthing and bonding arrangements, if necessary for the protective measure
                       applied to the addition or alteration, are adequate
            Where the work is an addition to an existing circuit, the designer/installer takes
            responsibility for the circuit, so far as is reasonably practicable, in addition to the items
            a - c above, not just the not just the small addition or alteration they are undertaking.
            There is no difference as to whether the addition or alteration is temporary or permanent,
            electricity and compliance with BS 7671 must be ensured in all circumstances.
            Consumer units in dwellings

            With BS 7671:2008+A3:2015, the requirements for non-combustible consumer units
            was introduced; see 2.2.6 of this Guide.
            Installers adding or amending circuits in dwellings will encounter older consumer
            units, i.e. those not complying with Regulation 421.1.201, for many years to come. It
            is important that installers do not advise the replacement of consumer units simply
            because they don't comply with the current version of BS 7671. To ensure the ongoing
            use of such enclosures and assemblies, the installer must ensure the following:
                   (a) confirmation that ALL conductor connections are correctly located in terminals
                       and are tight and secure; this may involve seeking the advice of the manufacturer
                       of the equipment to establish correct torque settings for screwdrivers when
                       checki ng terminals. This applies to all conductor/busbar connections within the
                       consumer unit, not just those relating to the addition or alteration
                   (b) there are no signs of overheating
                   (c) all covers, shields and barriers supplied when originally installed are present
                       and in a good, serviceable condition.
                   It must be verified for all conductor/ busbar connections:

                     (i)   terminals are not clamping onto insulation
                     (ii) conductor are not damaged e.g. through "incision" on a solid conductor
                           during insulation removal, or strands removed
                     (iii) conductors are correctly placed, for example on the correct side of a
                           moving plate in a cage-clamp terminal
                     (iv) the permitted number of conductors per terminal is not exceeded
                     (v) no undue mechanical strain on the electrical connection, particularly
                           incoming tails.

                          product recall. This could be achieved by direct question to the manufacturer.

            7.9           Installation and use of non-standard cables
  511.2     For the purposes of this guidance publication and ensuring compliance with BS 7671, the
            installation and use of non-standard cables, such as SY, CY and YY cables is discouraged.
            The letters signify:
            S - steel braid
            Y -PVC
            C - copper braid
            To identify:
            SY cables -steel braided, usually translucent sheath, PVC insulated flexible conductors
            YY cables - usually grey PVC sheath, PVC insulated flexible conductors
            CY cables - tinned copper wire braid, usually grey PVC sheath, PVC insulated flexible
                        conductors
            To meet the requirements of BS 7671, every item of equipment must comply with a
            British or Harmonized Standard, in the absence of such, reference can be made to IEC
            standards or the appropriate standard of another country. SY, YY and CY cables are not
            made to British or Harmonised Standards. Some manufacturers state that their cables
            "generally" comply with a British Standard; this is not deemed sufficient for the purposes
            of BS 7671.
            It is important that cables have approval from an independent testing organisation and
            installers should ensure that all cables purchased have manufacturers' identification and
            a specification reference/standard number pri nted on the sheath to enable testing, if
            necessary, and traceability.


512.1.5     7.10 EMC Directive and compatibility
            The designer of the fixed installation shall ensure that the installed fixed equipment,
            where relevant, is designed and manufactured in accordance with the EMC Directive
            2014/30/EU and, upon request, the responsible person for the fixed installation shall
            provide the required documentation.
            For straightforward situations, installations composed solely of CE marked apparatus
            installed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, with the instructions for
            installation, use and maintenance being available for inspection, would conform to this
            Directive.

                  -   BD3 (Crowded)
                  -   BD4 (Difficult and crowded)
          Cables must not encroach on escape routes unless they meet the recommended
          requirements of the relevant part of BS EN 60332-3 series and achieve at least 60 %
          light transmittance when tested in accordance with BS EN 61034-2. Cables in escape
          routes must be as short as practicable. Cables encroaching on escape routes must not be
          installed within arm's reach unless they are provided with protection against mechanical
          damage likely to occur during an evacuation.
          Where used, cable management systems must be one or more of the following types:
               (i)   conduit systems classified as non-flame propagating according to
                     BS EN 61386;
               (ii) cable trunking systems and cable ducting systems classified as non-flame
                     propagating according to BS EN 50085;
               (iii) cable tray and cable ladder systems classified as non-flame propagating
                     according to BS EN 61537; or
               (iv) powertrack systems meeting the requirements of BS EN 61534.
          If the cables are completely enclosed and protected by any of the cable management
          systems (i) and (ii) above, they do not have to meet the recommended requirements
          of the relevant part of BS EN 60332-3 series.
          Note:       Cables need to satisfy the requirements of the CPR in respect of their reaction to fire.
                      See BS 7671 Appendix 2, item 17.

          Cables that are supplying safety circuits must have a resistance to fire rating of either
          the time authorized by regulations for building elements or one hour in the absence of
          such a regulation.

              8.1       Summary of requirements
       701    Due to the presence of water, locations containing a bath or shower are onerous for
              equipment and there is an increased danger of electric shock.
              The additional requirements can be summarised as follows:

701.411.3.3         (a) all low voltage circuits serving the location must be protected by 30 mA RCDs
701.411.3.3         (b) all low voltage circuits passing through zones 1 and 2 but not serving the
                        location must be protected by 30 mA RCDs
 701.512.3          (c) socket-outlets, e.g. BS 1363, are not allowed within 3 metres of zone 1 (the
                        edge of the bath or shower basin)
 701.512.2          (d) protection against ingress of water is specified for equipment within the zones,
                        see Table 8.1 and Figures 8.1(i) to 8.1(iii)
 701.512.3          (e) there are restrictions as to where appliances, switchgear and wiring accessories
                        may be installed, see Table 8.1 and Figures 8.1(i) to 8.1(iii).

       701 Where the space under a bath is accessible by a means of a tool, this is considered to
  701.32.3 be outside the zones. Should it be necessary to connect electrical equipment beneath
 701.512.3 a bath, e.g. whirlpool units, the connection must comply with Regulation 701.512.3,
           meaning that socket-outlets would not be permitted beneath a bath.

       701    The inside of an airing cupboard in a bathroom is deemed to be outside the location
  701.32.3    and must effectively limit the extent of the location, just as a bathroom door separates
 701.512.3    the bathroom as a special location from the rest of the property. However, it is strongly
   415.1.1
              recommended where an airing cupboard opens into zone 1 or zone 2, circuits supplying
              equipment in the airing cupboard are be provided with additional protection by an RCD
              rated at 30 mA.

 701.415.2    Supplementary bonding of locations containing a bath or shower is required unless all
              the following requirements are met:

  411.3.2.2         . ,._ all circuits of the location meet the required disconnection times,
701.411.3.3         . ,._ all circuits of the location have additional protection by 30 mA RCDs, and
  411.3.1.2         . ,._ all extraneous-conductive parts within the location are effectively connected
                          by main protective bonding conductors to the main earthing terminal of the
                          installation.



                                                                                            On-Site Guide       93

       Note:         An example of this is where a metallic water service pipe enters the building in the bathroom
                     and would be connected to the main earthing terminal of the electrical installation by means
                     of a main bonding conductor.

                8.3.1         Locations containing a bath and shower
  701.753       Underfloor heating installations in locations containing a bath and shower should have
                an overall earthed metallic grid or the heating cable should have an earthed metallic
                sheath, which must be connected to the protective conductor of the supply circuit.

753.411.3.2     All underfloor heating installations must have additional protection by an RCD rated at
   415.1.1      30 mA.

753.411.3.2     In areas other than special locations, Class I heating units which do not have an exposed-
   415.1.1      conductive-part, i.e. integrated earth screen or sheath, must have a metallic grid, with
                a spacing of not more than 30 mm, installed above the floor heating elements. The
                grid must be connected to the protective conductor of the electrical installation and
                the heating system protected by an RCD with a rated residual operating current not
                exceeding 30 mA.

753.415.1       In areas where occupants are not expected to be completely wet, a circuit supplying
 701.753        heating equipment of Class II construction or equivalent insulation should be provided
                with additional protection by the use of an RCD with a rated residual operating cu rrent
                not exceeding 30 mA.

            9.1         Inspection and testing
    641.1   Every installation must be inspected and tested during erection and on completion before
            being put into service to verify, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the requirements
            of the Regulations have been met.

            Precautions must be taken to avoid danger to persons and to avoid damage to property
            and installed equipment during inspection and testing.
644.4.202   If the inspection and tests are satisfactory, a signed Electrical Installation Certificate together
    644.1   with a Schedule of Inspections and a Schedule of Test Results (as in Appendix G) are to be
    644.4
            given to the person ordering the work.


            9.2         Inspection
            9.2.1 Procedure and purpose

                10.1 Safety and equipment
HSR25, EWR      Electrical testing involves danger. The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 states that
Regulation 14   working on live conductors is permissible provided that

                      (a) it is unreasonable in all the circumstances for it to be dead;
                      (b) reasonable in all the circumstances for the work to be carried out; and
                      (c) that suitable precautions are taken to prevent injury.

                Live testing of electrical installations is, therefore, reasonable as it is a recognised method
                of assessing the suitability and safety of an electrical installation; suitable precautions
                must be taken by employing the correct test equipment and suitable personal protective
                equipment.
                Although live testing and diagnosis for fault finding may be justifiable, there could be no
                justification for any subsequent repair work to be carried out live.

       641.1    It is the test operative's duty to ensure their own safety, and the safety of others, whilst
       643.1    working through test procedures. When using test instruments, this is best achieved by
                precautions such as:
                      (a) knowledge and experience of the correct application and use of the test
                          instrumentation, leads, probes and accessories (is of the greatest importance)
       643.1          (b) checking that the test instrumentation is made in accordance with the
                          appropriate safety standards such as BS EN 61243-3 for two-pole voltage
                          detectors and BS EN 61010 orBS EN 61557 for instruments
                      (c) checking before each use that all leads, probes, accessories (including all
                          devices such as crocodile clips used to attach to conductors) and instruments
                          including the proving unit are clean, undamaged and functioning; also,
                          checking that isolation can be safely effected and that any locks or other means
                          necessary for securing the isolation are available and functional
       GS38           (d) observing the safety measures and procedures set out in HSE Guidance Note
                          GS 38 for all instruments, leads, probes and accessories. Some test instrument
                          manufacturers advise that their instruments be used in conjunction with fused
                          test leads and probes. Others advise the use of non-fused leads and probes
                          when the instrument has in-built electrical protection but it should be noted
                          that such electrical protection does not extend to the probes and leads.

               10.2 Sequence of tests
               Note:         The advice given does not preclude other test methods.

   643.1       Tests should be carried out in the following sequence:

               10.2.1 Before the supply is conneded (i.e. isolated)
643.22.1         (a)      continuity of protective conductors, including main and supplementary bonding
       (i)
 643.2.1         (b)      continuity of ring final circuit conductors, including protective conductors
     (ii)
  643.3         (c)       insulation resistance
  643.6         (d)       polarity (by continuity method)
 643.1.2        (e)       earth electrode resistance, using an earth electrode resistance tester (see g also).

               10.2.2 With the supply conneded and energised
   GS38         (f)      check polarity of supply, using an approved voltage indicator
 643.7.2        (g)      earth electrode resistance, using a loop impedance tester
   NOTE
 643.7.3        (h)      earth fault loop impedance
 643.7.3.       (i)      prospective fault current measurement, if not determined by enquiry of the distributor
     201
 643.10         (j)     functional testing, including RCDs and switchgear.
               Results obtained during the various tests should be recorded on the Schedule of
               Test Results (Appendix G) for future reference and checked for acceptability against
               prescribed criteria.


               10.3 Test procedures
 643.2.1       10.3.1 Continuity of circuit proted.ive condudors and
                            protedive bonding condudors (for ring final circuits
                            see 10.3.2)
               Test methods 1 and 2 are alternative ways of testing the continuity of protective
               conductors.
               Every protective conductor, including circuit protective conductors, the earthing
               conductor, main and supplementary bonding conductors, should be tested to verify that
               the conductors are electrically sound and correctly connected.
               Test method 1 detailed below, in addition to checking the continuity of the protective
               conductor, also measures (R 1 + R2) which, when added to the external impedance
               (Ze), enables the earth fault loop impedance (Zs) to be checked against the design, see
               10.3.6.
               Note:        (R1 + R:i) is the sum of the resistances of the line condudor (R 1) and the circuit protective
                            conductor (R2) between the point of utilisation and origin of the installation.

          Use an ohmmeter capable of measuring a low resistance for these tests.
          Test method 1 can only be used to measure (R 1 + R2) for an 'all-insulated' installation,
          such as an installation wired in 'twin and earth'. Installations incorporating steel conduit,
          steel trunking, MICC and PVC/SWA cables will produce parallel paths to protective
          conductors. Such installations should be inspected for soundness of construction and
          test method 1 or 2 used to prove continuity.

          •
643.2.1   I     Continuity of circuit protective conductors
          Continuity test method 1
          Bridge the line conductor to the protective conductor at the distribution board so as to
          include all the circuit. Then test between line and earth terminals at each point in the
          circuit. The measurement at the circuit's extremity shou ld be recorded and is the value
          of (R1 + R2) for the circuit under test (see Figure 10.3.1(i)).
          If the instrument does not include an 'auto-null' facility, or this is not used, the resistance
          of the test leads should be measured and deducted from the resistance readings
          obtained.

        Connect one terminal of the test instrument to a long test lead and connect this to the
        installation main earthing terminal.
        Connect the other terminal of the instrument to another test lead and use this to make
        contact with the protective conductor at various points on the circuit, such as luminaires,
        switches, spur outlets, etc. (see Figure 10.3.1(ii)).
        If the instrument does not include an 'auto-null' facility, or this is not used, the resistance
        of the test leads should be measured and deducted from the resistance readings
        obtained.
        The resistance of the protective conductor R2 is recorded on the Schedule of Test
        Results; see Appendix G.

          The Continuity and connection verified boxes on the Electrical Installation Certificate
          should be ticked if the continuity and connection of the earthing conductor and of
          each main bonding conductor are satisfactory. The details of the material and the cross-
          sectional areas of the conductors must also be recorded.

643.2.1   10.3.2 Continuity of ring final circuit condudors
          A three-step test is required to verify the continuity of the line, neutral and protective
          conductors and the correct wiring of a ring final circuit. The test results show if the ring
          has been interconnected to create an apparently continuous ring circuit which is in fact
          broken, or wrongly wired.
          Use a low-resistance ohmmeter for this test.
          Step 1

          The line, neutral and protective conductors are identified at the distribution board and
          the end-to-end resistance of each is measured separately (see Figure 10.3.2(i)). These
          resistances are r1, rn and r2 respectively. A finite reading confirms that there is no open
          circuit on the ring conductors under test. The resistance values obtained should be
          the same (within 0.05 0) if the conductors are all of the same size. If the protective
          conductor has a reduced csa the resistance r2 of the protective conductor loop will be
          proportionally higher than that of the line and neutral loops, for example, 1.67 times for
          2.5/1.5 mm 2 cable. If these relationships are not achieved then either the conductors
          are incorrectly identified or there is something wrong at one or more of the accessories.

        Step 2

        The line and neutral conductors are then conneded together at the distribution board
        so that the outgoing line condudor is connected to the returning neutral condudor and
        vice versa (see Figure 10.3.2(ii)). The resistance between line and neutral condudors
        is measured at each socket-outlet. The readings at each of the socket-outlets wired into
        the ring will be substantially the same and the value will be approximately one-quarter
        of the resistance of the line plus the neutral loop resistances, i.e. (r 1 + rn)/4. Any socket-
        outlets wired as spurs will have a higher resistance value due to the resistance of the
        spur conductors.
        Note:       Where single-core cables are used, care should be taken to verify that the line and neutral
                    conductors of opposite ends of the ring circuit are connected together. An error in this respect
                    will be apparent from the readings taken at the socket-outlets, progressively increasing in value
                    as readings are taken towards the midpoint of the ring, then decreasing again towards the other
                    end of the ring.

        T Figure 10.3.2(ii) Step 2: The line and neutral conductors are cross-connected and the
                            resistance measured at each socket-outlet

                                                                           =~ cpc

        Step 3

        The above step is then repeated, this time with the line and cpc cross-connected at
        the distribution board (see Figure 10.3.2(iii)). The resistance between line and earth
        is measured at each socket-outlet. The readings obtained at each of the socket-outlets
        wired into the ring will be substantially the same and the value will be approximately
        one-quarter of the resistance of the line plus cpc loop resistances, i.e. (r 1 + rL)/4. As
        before, a higher resistance value will be measured at any socket-outlets wired as spurs.
        The highest value recorded represents the maximum (R1 + R2) of the circuit and is
        recorded on the Schedule of Test Results. The value can be used to determine the earth
        fault loop impedance (Zs) of the circuit to verify compliance with the loop impedance
        requirements of BS 7671 (see 10.3.6).

             When testing individual circuits, it is important to remove the fuse or open the circuit-
             breaker of that circuit; this ensures that no other circuits at the board influence the result
             of the test.
             Where the removal of lamps and/or the disconnection of current-using equipment is
             impracticable, the local switches controlling such lamps and/or equipment should be
             open.
             Where a circuit contains two-way switching, the two-way switches must be operated one
             at a time and further insulation resistance tests carried out to ensure that all the circuit
             wiring is tested.

          for the particular circuit may be reduced to 250 V DC but the insulation resistance must

643.3.2   FELV circuits are tested as low voltage circuits at 500 V DC.

              10.3.4 Polarity
          See Figure 10.3.4.

          The method of test prior to connecting the supply is the same as test method 1 for
          checking the continuity of protective conductors which should have already been
          carried out (see 10.3.1). For ring final circuits a visual check may be required (see 10.3.2
          following step 3).
          It is important to confirm that:
                              (a) overcurrent devices and single-pole controls are in the line conductor,
                              (b) except for E14 and E27 lampholders to BS EN 60238, centre contact screw
                                  lampholders have the outer threaded contact connected to the neutral, and
                              (c) socket-outlet and similar accessory polarities are correct.

 GS 38    After connection of the supply, correct polarity must be confirmed using a voltage
          indicator or a test lamp (in either case with leads complying with the recommendations
          of HSE Guidance Note GS 38).

            10.3.5 Earth eledrode resistance measurement
            10.3.5.1       Loop impedance method
            If the electrode under test is being used in conjunction with an RCD protecting an
            installation forming part of a n system, the following method of test may be applied.
            A loop impedance tester is connected between the line conductor at the origin of the
            installation and the earth electrode with the test link open and a test performed. This
            impedance reading is treated as the electrode resistance and is then added to the
            resistance of the protective conductor for the protected circuits. The test should be
            carried out before energising the remainder of the installation.
 Table      The measured resistance should meet the following criteria and those of 10.3.6 but, in
  41.5      any event, should not exceed 200 0.
Note 2
411.5.3     For n systems, the value of the earth electrode resistance RA in ohms multiplied by
            the operating current in amperes of the protective device l.c..n should not exceed 50 V.
            For example, if RA = 200 0, then the maximum RCD operating current should not
            exceed 250 mA.
            REMEMBER TO REPLACE THE TEST LINK.

            10.3.5.2      Proprietary earth electrode test instrument
            The test requires the use of two temporary test spikes (electrodes), and is carried out in
            the following manner.
            Connection to the earth electrode, E, is made using terminals Cl and Pl of a four-
            terminal earth tester. To exclude the resistance of the test leads from the resistance
            reading, individual leads should be taken from these terminals and connected separately
            to the electrode. If the test lead resistance is insignificant, the two terminals may be
            short-circuited at the tester and connection made with a single test lead, the same being
            true if using a three-terminal tester. Connection to the temporary spikes is made as
            shown in Figure 10.3.5.2. The distance between the test spikes is important. If they are
            too close together, their resistance areas will overlap.
            In general, reliable results may be expected if the distance between the electrode
            under test and the current spike Tl is at least ten times the maximum dimension of
            the electrode system, for example, 30 m for a 3 m long rod electrode. With an auxiliary
            electrode T2 inserted halfway between the electrode under test E and temporary
            electrode Tl, the voltage drop between E and T2 is measured. The resistance of the
            electrode is then obtained by the test instrument from the voltage between E and T2
            divided by the current flowing between E and Tl, provided that there is no overlap of
            the resistance areas.
            To confirm that the electrode resistance obtained above is a true value, two further
            readings are taken, firstly with electrode T2 moved ::::6 m further from electrode E and
            secondly with electrode T2 moved 6 m closer to electrode E. If the results obtained from

          the three tests are substantially the same, the average of the three readings is taken as
          the resistance of the earth electrode under test. If the results obtained are significantly
          different, the procedure should be repeated with test electrode Tl placed further from
          the electrode under test.

          The instrument output current may be AC or reversed DC to overcome electrolytic
          effects. As these types of test instrument employ phase-sensitive detectors (PSD), the
          errors associated with stray currents are eliminated. The instrument should be capable
          of checking that the resistance of the temporary spikes used for testing is within the
          accuracy limits stated in the instrument specification. This may be achieved by an
          indicator provided on the instrument, or the instrument should have a sufficiently high
          upper range to enable a discrete test to be performed on the spikes. If the temporary
          spike resistance is too high, measures to reduce the resistance will be necessary, such as
          driving the spikes deeper into the ground.

          10.3.6 Earth fault loop impedance
643.7.3   The earth fault loop impedance (Zs) is required to be determined for the furthest point

              the measurement made between line and earth of the supply.
              REMEMBER TO RECONNECT THE EARTHING CONDUCTOR TO THE EARTH
              TERMINAL AFTER THE TEST.
              Direct measurement of Z5 can only be made on a live installation. Neither the connection
              with earth nor bonding conductors are disconnected. The reading given by the loop
              impedance tester will usually be less than Ze + (R1 + R2.) because of parallel earth return
              paths provided by any bonded extraneous-conductive-parts. This must be taken into
              account when comparing the results with design data.
   641.1      Care should be taken to avoid any shock hazard to the testing personnel and to other
              persons on site during the tests.
              The value of Z5 determined for each circuit should not exceed the value given in Appendix
              B for the particular overcurrent device and cable.
411.4.204     For TN systems, when protection is afforded by an RCD, the rated residual operating
              current in amperes times the earth fault loop impedance in ohms should not exceed 50
              V. This test should be carried out before energising other parts of the system.
               Note:      For further information on the measurement of earth fault loop impedance, refer to lET
                          Guidance Note 3 - Inspection & Testing.


 643J<fi· 10.3.7 Measurement of prospedive fault current
              It is not recommended that installation designs are based on measured values of
              prospective fault current, as changes to the distribution network subsequent to
              completion of the installation may increase fault levels.
              Designs should be based on the maximum fault current provided by the distributor (see
              7.2.7(i)).
              If it is desired to measure prospective fault levels this should be done with all main
              bonding in place. Measurements are made at the distribution board between live
              conductors and between line conductors and earth.
              For three-phase supplies, the maximum possible fault level will be approximately twice
              the single-phase to neutral value. (For three-phase to earth faults, neutral and earth path
              impedances have no influence.)

              10.3.8 Check of phase sequence
  643.9       In the case of three-phase circuits, it should be verified that the phase sequence is
              maintained.

  643.1 o   RCDs should be tested as described in Section 11.
            Switchgear, controls, etc., should be functionally tested; that is, operated to check that
            they work and are properly mounted and installed.

            10.3.1 0 Verification of voltage drop
            Note:     Verification of voltage drop is not normally required during initial verification.

   643.11   Where required, it should be verified that voltage drop does not exceed the limits stated
            in relevant product standards of installed equipment.
 525.201    Where no such limits are stated, voltage drop should be such that it does not impair the
            proper and safe fu nctioning of installed equipment.
            Typically, voltage drop will be evaluated using the measured circuit impedances.
            The requirements for voltage drop are deemed to be met where the voltage drop
            between the origin and the relevant piece of equipment does not exceed the values
            stated in Appendix 4 of BS 7671:2018.
  Appx 4    Appendix 4, paragraph 6.4, gives maximum values of voltage drop for both lighting and
Table 4Ab   other uses and depending upon whether the installation is supplied directly from an LV
            distribution system or from a private LV supply.
            It should be remembered that voltage drop may exceed the values stated in
            Appendix 4 in situations, such as motor starting periods and where equipment has a
            high inrush current, where such events remain within the limits specified in the relevant
            product standard or reasonable recommendation by an equipment manufacturer.

Residual current device (RCD) is the generic term for a device that operates when the
residual current in the circuit reaches a predetermined value. An RCD is a protective
device used to automatically disconnect t he electrical supply when an imbalance is
detected between the line and neutral conductors. In the case of a single-phase circuit,
see Figure 11 .0, the device monitors the difference in currents between the line and
neutral conductors. In a healthy circuit, where there is no earth fault current or protective
conductor current, the sum of the currents in the line and neutral conductors is zero. If a
line to earth fault develops, a portion of the line conductor current w ill not return through
the neutral conductor. The device monitors this difference, operates and disconnects the
circuit when the residual current reaches a preset limit, the residual operating current
(I L:>n).

 643.7       11.1         General test procedure
            The tests are made on the load side of the RCD, as near as practicable to its point of
            installation and between the line conductor of the protected circuit and the associated
            circuit protective conductor. The load supplied should be disconnected during the test.


            11.2 General-purpose RCC8s to 85 4293
                    (a) With a leakage current flowing equivalent to 50 per cent of the rated tripping
                        current of the RCD, the device should not open.
                    (b) With a leakage current flowing equivalent to 100 per cent of the rated tripping
                        current of the RCD, the device should open in less than 200 ms. Where the
                        RCD incorporates an intentional time delay it should trip within a time range
                        from '50 % of the rated time delay plus 200 ms' to '100% of the rated time
                        delay plus 200 ms'.

                        current of the RCD, the device should not open.
                    (b) With a leakage current flowing equivalent to 100 per cent of the rated tripping
                        current of the RCD, the device should open in less than 300 ms unless it is of
                        'TypeS' (or selective) which incorporates an intentional time delay. In this case,
                        it should trip within a time range from 130 ms to 500 ms.

         11.6 Integral test device
643 10   An integral test device is incorporated in each RCD. This device enables the electrical
         and mechanical parts of the RCD to be verified, by pressing the button marked 'T' or
         'Test' (Figure 11.0).
         Operation of the integral test device does not provide a means of checking:
              (a) the continuity of the earthing conductor or the associated circuit protective
                  conductors
              (b) any earth electrode or other means of earthing
              (c) any other part of the associated installation earthing.
         The test button will only operate the RCD if the device is energised.
         Confirm that the notice to test RCDs six-monthly (by pressing the test button) is fixed in
         a prominent position (see 6.11).


         11.7 Multipole RCDs
         As each live conductor of the RCD is incorporated in the magnetic sensing circuit it is
         not necessary to perform the test for poles L2 and L3. However, if there is any doubt as
         to the authenticity of the device in question - in terms of a fake or counterfeit device -
         the advice would be to repeat the test for poles L2 and L3. It goes without saying that
         such important devices, designed to protect life and property, should be obtained from
         trusted sources and made by reputable manufacturers.
         If a decision is made to test the RCD on all three lines, there should be little or no
         discernible difference in operating times as each pole is incorporated in the magnetic
         sensing circuit. If, for example, the test performed on one pole did not meet the required
         disconnection time, yet tests on the other two poles were satisfactory, the device should
         be considered faulty and replaced.

311   This appendix provides information on the determination of the maximum demand for
      an installation and includes the current demand to be assumed for commonly used
      equipment. It also includes some notes on the application of allowances for diversity.

      The information and values given in this appendix are intended only for guidance
      because it is impossible to specify the appropriate allowances for diversity for every
      type of installation and such allowances call for special knowledge and experience. The
      values given in Table A2, therefore, may be increased or decreased as decided by the
      installation designer concerned. No guidance is given for blocks of residential dwellings,
      large hotels, industrial and large commercial premises; such installations should be
      assessed on a case-by-case basis.

      The current demand of a final circuit is determined by adding the current demands of
      all points of utilisation and equipment in the circuit and, where appropriate, making an
      allowance for diversity. Typical current demands to be used for this addition are given
      in Table Al.

      The current demand of an installation consisting of a number of final circuits may be
      assessed by using the allowances for diversity given in Table A2 which are applied to
      the total current demand of all the equipment supplied by the installation. The current
      demand of the installation should not be assessed by adding the current demands of
      the individual final circuits obtained as outlined above. In Table A2 the allowances are
      expressed either as percentages of the current demand or, where followed by the letters
      f.l. (full load), as percentages of the rated full load current of the current-using equipment.
      The current demand for any final circuit which is a standard circuit arrangement complying
      with Appendix H is the rated current of the overcurrent protective device of that circuit.

      An alternative method of assessing the current demand of an installation supplying a
      number of final circuits is to add the diversified current demands of the individual circuits
      and then apply a further allowance for diversity. In this method the allowances given in
      Table A2 should not be used, the values to be chosen being the responsibility of the
      installation designer.

      The use of other methods of determining maximum demand is not precluded where
      specified by the installation designer. After the design currents for all the circuits have
      been determined, enabling the conductor sizes to be chosen, it is necessary to check
      that the limitation on voltage drop is met.

               watts multiplied by not less than 1.8. This multiplier is based upon the assumption that the circuit is
               corrected to a power factor of not less than 0.85 lagging, and takes into account controlgear losses
               and harmonic current.

                    Notes to Table Al:

                       *   In this context an instantaneous water-heater is considered to be a water-heater of any loading which heats water only while the tap is turned on and therefore
                           uses electricity intermittently.
                       t   It is important to ensure that distribution boards or consumer units are of sufficient rating to take the total load connected to them without the application of any
                           diversity.
  643.7.3    The tables in this appendix provide maximum permissible measured earth fault loop
411.4.201    impedances (Zs) for compliance with BS 7671 where the standard final circuits of Table
411.4.203    7.1 (i) are used. The values are those that must not be exceeded in the tests carried out
             under 10.3.6 at an ambient temperature of 10 oc. Table 88 provides correction factors
             for other ambient temperatures.
             Where the cables to be used are to Table 3, 4 or 5 of BS 6004, Table 3, 4 or 5 of
             BS 7211, Table 8 .1 or 8 .2 of BS EN 50525-3-41 or are other thermoplastic (PVC) or
             thermosetting (low smoke halogen-free - LSHF) cables to these British Standards and
             the cable loading is such that the maxi mum operating temperature is 70 °(, then Tables
             81-85 give the maximum earth fault loop impedances for circuits with:
                                                                                         2                 2
                  (a) protective conductors of copper and having from 1 mm to 16 mm cross-
                      sectional area
                  (b) an overcurrent protective device (i.e. a fuse) to:
                          (i) BS 3036 (Table 81)
                          (ii) BS 88-2.2 and BS 88-6 (Table 82)
                          (iii) BS 88-2 (BS EN 60269-2) (Table 83)
                          (iv) BS 88-3 (Table 84)
                          (v) BS 1361 (Table 85).

             For each type of fuse, two tables are given:

 411.3.2.2         Ill> where the circuit concerned is a final circuit not exceeding 32 A and the
                        maximum disconnection time for compliance with Regulation 411 .3.2.2 is 0.4
                        s for TN systems, and
 411.3.2.3         Ill> where the circuit concerned is a final circuit exceeding 32 A or a distribution
                        circuit, and the disconnection time for compliance with Regulation 411 .3.2.3 is
                        5 s for TN systems.

  543.1.3    In each table the earth fault loop impedances given correspond to the appropriate
             disconnection time from a comparison of the time/current characteristics of the device
             concerned and the equation given in Regulation 543.1.3.
             The tabulated values apply only when the nominal voltage to Earth (UJ is 230 V.

B       Appendix
        Table 86 gives the maximum measured Zs for circuits protected by circuit-breakers to
        BS 3871 -1 and BS EN 60898 and RCBOs to BS EN 61009.
        Note: The impedances tabulated in this appendix are lower than those in Tables 41.2, 41.3 and 41.4 of
              BS 7671 as the impedances in this appendix are measured values at an assumed conductor
              temperature of 10 oc whilst those in BS 7671 are design figures at the conductor maximum
              permitted operating temperature. The correction factor (divisor) used is 1.25. For smaller section
              conductors the impedance may also be limited by the adiabatic equation of Regulation 543.1.3.
              A value of k of 115 from Table 54.3 of BS 7671 is used. This is suitable for PVC insulated and
              sheathed cables to Table 4, 7 or 8 of BS 6004 and for thermosetting (LSHF) insulated and
              sheathed cables to Table 3, 5, 6 or 7 of BS 7211 . The k value is based on both the thermoplastic
              (PVC) and LSHF cables opera ting at a maximum temperature of 70 oc.

        Notes:

        1    The correction factor is given by: {1 + 0.004 (Ambient temp- 20)}/{1+0.004(10·20)} where 0.004
             is the simplified resistance coefficient per oc at 20 oc given by BS EN 60228 for both copper and
             aluminium conductors. (Alternatively the correction factor is given by (Ambient temp + 230)/(1 0 +
             230)).
        2    The factors are different to those of Table 12 because Table B8 corrects from 10 oc and Table 12 from
             20 oc.
        The appropriate ambient correction factor from Table B8 is applied to the earth fault loop
        impedances of Tables Bl - B6 if the ambient temperature is other than 10 oc when the
        circuit loop impedances are measured.
        For example, if the ambient temperature is 25 oc the measured earth fault loop
        impedance of a circuit protected by a 32 A type B circuit-breaker to BS EN 60898 should
        not exceed 1.1 x 1.06 = 1.17 0.

        Notes:

        1      The use of cable covers or equivalent mechanical protection is desirable for all underground cables
               which might otherwise subsequently be disturbed. Route marker tape should also be installed, buried
               just below ground level. Cables should be buried at a sufficient depth.
        2      Cables having thermoplastic (PVC) insulation or sheath should preferably not be used where the
               ambient temperature is consistently below 0 oc or has been within the preceding 24 hours. Where
               they are to be installed during a period of low temperature, precautions should be taken to avoid
               risk of mechanical damage during handling. A minimum ambient temperature of 5 oc is advised in
               BS 7540:2005 (series) Electric cables - Guide to use for cables with a rated voltage not exceeding
               450/750 V for some types of PVC insulated and sheathed cables.
        l      Cables must be suitable for the maximum ambient temperature, and must be protected from any
               excess heat produced by other equipment, including other cables.
        4      Thermosetting cable types (to BS 7211 or BS 5467) can operate with a conductor temperature of 90
               oc. This must be limited to 70 oc where drawn into a conduit, etc., with thermoplastic (PVC) insulated
               conductors or connected to electrical equipment (Regulations 512.1.5 and 523.1), or where such
               cables are installed in plastic conduit or trunking.

Migration of plasticiser from thermoplastic (PVC)
materials
Thermoplastic (PVC) sheathed cables, including thermosetting insulated with
thermoplastic sheath, e.g. LSHF, must be separated from expanded polystyrene materials
to prevent take-up of the cable plasticiser by the polystyrene as this will reduce the
flexibility of the cables.

Thermal insulation
Thermoplastic (PVC) sheathed cables in roof spaces must be clipped clear of any
insulation made of expanded polystyrene granules.

Cable clips
Thermoplastic (PVC) cable clips are softened by contact with polystyrene. Nylon and
polypropylene are unaffected.

Grommets
Natural rubber grommets can be softened by contact with thermoplastic (PVC). Synthetic
rubbers are more resistant. Thermoplastic (PVC) grommets are not affected, but could
affect other plastics.

Wood preservatives
Thermoplastic (PVC) sheathed cables should be covered to prevent contact with
preservative fluids during application. After the solvent has evaporated (good ventilation
is necessary) the preservative has no effect.

             (d) Where used as connections to equipment, flexible cables should, where possible, be of the minimum
                 practicable length to minimize danger. The length of the flexible cable must be such that will permit
                 correct operation of the protective device.
             (e) Where attached to equipment flexible cables should be protected against tension, crushing, abrasion,
                 torsion and kinking, particularly at the inlet point to the electrical equipment. At such inlet points it
                 may be necessary to use a device which ensures that the cable is not damaged through bending.
                 Strain relief, clamping devices or cable guards should not damage the cable.
             (f) Flexible cables should not be run under carpets or other floor coverings where furniture or other
                 equipment may rest on them or where heat dissipation from the cable will be affected. Flexible cables
                 should not be placed where there is a risk of damage from traffic passing over them, unless suitably
                 protected.
             (g) Flexible cables should not be used in contact with or close to heated surfaces, especially if the surface
                 approaches the upper thermal limit of the cable.

Notes:

(a) The spacings tabulated allow for maximum fill of cables permitted by the Regulations and the thermal
    limits specified in the relevant British Standards. They assume that the conduit is not exposed to other
    mechanical stress.
(b) Supports should be positioned within 300 mm of bends or fittings. A flexible conduit should be of
    such length that it does not need to be supported in its run.
(c) The inner radius of a conduit bend should be not less than 2.5 times the outside diameter of the
    conduit.

A number of variable factors affect any attempt to arrive at a standard method of
assessing the capacity of conduit or trunking.
Some of these are:

      . ,._   reasonable care (of drawing-in)
      . ,._   acceptable use of the space available
      . ,._   tolerance in cable sizes
      . ,._   tolerance in conduit and trunking.

The following tables can only give guidance on the maximum number of cables which
should be drawn in. The sizes should ensure an easy pull with low risk of damage to the
cables.

Only the ease of drawing-in is taken into account. The electrical effects of
grouping are not. As the number of circuits increases the installed current-
carrying capacity of the cable decreases. Cable sizes have to be increased
with consequent increase in cost of cable and conduit.

It may sometimes be more attractive economically to divide the circuits concerned
between two or more enclosures.

If thermosetting cables are installed in the same conduit or trunking as thermoplastic
(PVC) insulated cables, the conductor operating temperature of any of the cables must
not exceed that for thermoplastic (PVC), i.e. thermosetting cables must be rated as
thermoplastic (PVC).
The following three cases are dealt with. Single-core thermoplastic (PVC) insulated
cables in:

     (a) straight runs of conduit not exceeding 3 m in length (Tables El and E2)
     (b) straight runs of conduit exceeding 3 m in length, or in runs of any length
         incorporating bends or sets (Tables E3 and E4)
     (c) trunking (Tables ES and E6).
For cables and/or conduits not covered by this appendix, advice on the number of cables
that can be drawn in should be obtained from the manufacturer.

Notes:
(a) These factors are for metal trunking and may be optimistic for plastic trunking, where the
     cross-sectional area available may be significantly reduced from the nominal by the thickness of the
     wall material.
( b) The provision of spare space is advisable; however, any circuits added at a later date must take into
     account grouping, Regulation 523.5.

        Other sizes and types of cable or trunking
        For sizes and types of cable or trunking other than those given in Tables E5 and E6,
        the number of cables installed should be such that the resulting space factor does not
        exceed 45 % of the net internal cross-sectional area.
        Space factor is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the sum of the overall cross-
        sectional areas of cables (including insulation and any sheath) to the internal cross-
        sectional area of the trunking or other cable enclosure in which they are installed. The
        effective overall cross-sectional area of a non-circular cable is taken as that of a circle of
        diameter equal to the major axis of the cable.
        Care should be taken to use trunking bends etc. which do not impose bending radii on
        cables less than those required by Table 05.

     523    Current-carrying capacity
    435.1   In this simplified approach the assumption is made that the overcurrent protective device
            provides both fault current and overload current protection.
            For cables buried in the ground, refer to BS 7671 :2018, Appendix 4.


            Procedure
Appx 4, 3        (a) The design current (lb) of the circuit must first be established.
                 (b) The overcurrent device rating (In) is then selected so that In is greater than or
  433.1.1
                         equal to lb
                         In ~   lb
            The tabulated current-carrying capacity of the selected cable (It) is then given by:


                         ~ ~ Ca~CiCt
            for simultaneously occurring factors.

            C is a rating factor to be applied where the installation conditions differ from those for
            which values of current-carrying capacity are tabulated in this appendix. The various
            rating factors are identified as follows:

                  Ill> Ca for ambient temperature, see Table F1
                  Ill> Cg for grouping, see Table F3
                  Ill> Ci for thermal insulation, see Table F2 (Note: For cables installed in thermal
                          insulation as described in Tables F4(i), FS(i) and F6, Ci = 1)
                  Ill> Ct for the type of protective device, i.e.:

433.1.202                -   where the protective device is a semi-enclosed fuse to BS 3036,
                             Ct= 0.725
                         -   for all other devices Ct = 1.

              Voltage drop
     525      To calculate the voltage drop in volts the tabulated value of voltage drop (mV/A/m) has
 Appx 4,6     to be multiplied by the design current of the circuit Clb), the length of run in metres (L),
              and divided by 1000 (to convert to volts):
                                  (mV/A/m)x bx L
              voltage drop=
                                      1000

              The requirements of BS 7671 are deemed to be satisfied if the voltage drop between
              the origin of the installation and a lighting point does not exceed 3 per cent of the
              nominal voltage (6.9 V) and for other current-using equipment or socket-outlets does
              not exceed 5 per cent (1 1.5 V single-phase) .

    s23.9    Thermal insulation
             Where a cable is to be run in a space to which thermal insulation is likely to be applied,
             the cable should, wherever practicable, be fixed in a position such that it will not be
             covered by the thermal insulation. Where fixing in such a position is impracticable, the
             cross-sectional area of the cable must be increased appropriately.
             For a cable installed in thermal insulation as described in Tables F4(i), FS(i) and F6 no
             correction is required.
             Note:     Reference methods 100, 101 and 102 require the cable to be in contact with the plasterboard
                       or the joists, see Tables 7.1 (ii) and 7.1 (iii) in Section 7.

             For a single cable likely to be totally surrounded by thermally insulating material over a
             length of more than 0.5 m, the current-carrying capacity should be taken, in the absence
             of more precise information, as 0.5 times the current-carrying capacity for that cable
             clipped direct to a surface and open (reference method C).
             Where a cable is totally surrounded by thermal insulation for less than 0.5 m the current-
             carrying capacity of the cable should be reduced appropriately depending on the size of
             cable, length in insulation and thermal properties of the insulation. The derating factors
                                                                         2
             in Table F2 are appropriate to conductor sizes up to 10 mm in thermal insulation having

                  Notes to Table F3:
                  (a) These factors are applicable to uniform groups of cables, equally loaded.
                  (b) Where horizontal clearances between adjacent cables exceed twice their overall diameter, no rating factor need be applied.
                  (c) The same factors are applied to:
                       .,. groups of two or three single-core cables
                       .,. multicore cables.
                  (d) If a group consists of both two- and three-core cables, the total number of cables is taken as the number of circuits, and the corresponding factor is applied to the
                       tables for two loaded conductors for the two-core cables, and to the tables for three loaded conductors for the three-core cables.
                  (e) If a group consists of n single-core cables it may either be considered as n/2 circuits of two loaded conductors (for single-phase circuits) or n/3 circuits of three loaded
                       conductors (for three-phase circuits).
                  (f) The rating factors given have been averaged over the range of conductor sizes and types of installation included in Tables 40 1A to 4J4A of BS 767 1 (this includes F4(i),
                       F5(i) and F6 of this guide) and the overall accuracy of tabulated values is within 5 %.
                  (g) For some installations and for other methods not provided for in the above table, it may be appropriate to use factors calculated for specific cases, see for example
                       Tables 4C4 and 4C5 of BS 767 1.
                  (h) Where cables having differing conductor operating temperature are grouped together, the current rating is to be based upon the lowest operating temperature of any
                       cable in the group.
                  (i ) If, due to known operating conditions, a cable is expected to carry not more than 30 Ofo of its grouped rating, it may be ignored for the purpose of obtaining the rating
523.5
                       factor for the rest of the group. For example, a group of N loaded cables would normally require a group rating factor of Cg applied to the tabulated It· However,
                       if M cables in the group carry loads which are not greater than 0.3 Cglt amperes the other cables can be sized by using the group rating factor corresponding to
                       (N minus M) cables.

                 Notes to Table F4(i):
                 1    The ratings for cables with thermosetting insulation are applicable for cables connected to equipment or accessories designed to operate with cables which run at a
                      temperature not exceeding 70 oc. Where conductor operating temperatures up to 90 oc are acceptable the current rating is increased - see Table 4E 1A of BS 767 1.
                 2    Where the conductor is to be protected by a semi-enclosed fuse to BS 3036, see the introduction to this appendix.
                 3    The current-carrying capacities in columns 2 to 5 are also applicable to flexible cables to BS 6004 Table 1(c) and to 90 oc heat-resisting PVC cables to BS 623 1
                      Tables 8 and 9 where the cables are used in fixed installations.

162   On-Site Guide

The certificates and forms are used with the kind permission of BSI.


Ci1           Introduction
Fundamentally, two types of form are recognised by BS 7671, certificates and reports:
       Ill> certificates are issued for new installation work
       Ill> reports are issued for inspections of existing installations.



Cil           Certification
Two types of certificate for new work are recognised by BS 7671:
       Ill> Electrical Installation Certificate
       Ill> Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate.


Gl.l          Eledrical lnstallat.ion Certificate
The Electrical Installation Certificate is intended to be issued where more significant
installation work is undertaken; examples are:

       Ill> a complete installation for a new property
       Ill> rewire of an existing installation
       Ill> replacement of a consumer unit
       Ill> addition of a new circuit from the distribution board or consumer unit.


Gl.l Minor Eledrical lnstallat.ion Works Certificate
The Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate is intended to be issued for an addition
or alteration to an existing circuit; examples are:

       Ill> adding lights to a lighting circuit
       Ill> adding socket-outlets to a ring final circuit
       Ill> rerouting an existing circuit
       Ill> replacing an existing shower with a larger power rating of unit
       Ill> replacing circuit-breakers with RCBOs where there is a difference of
            overcurrent type, e.g. replacing Type C for Type B.



                                                                                  On-Site Guide       163
                                                     ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology
G       Appendix
        In each case, the characteristics of the circuit are likely to have been altered, whether it's
        the addition of extra load or changes to the original earth fault loop impedance.

        Gl.3 Accountability
        Certificates call for those responsible for the electrical installation or construction work to
        certify that the requirements of the Regulations have been met. Under no circumstances
        should a third party issue a certificate for installation work they have not undertaken.
        It is common with larger installations for the design to be carried out by one company,
        installation or construction by someone else and the inspection and testing to be
        undertaken by some other, e.g. a testing organisation working on behalf of the installer;
        this is quite acceptable but the company who carries out the installation must issue the
        Electrical Installation Certificate.


        Ci3           Reporting
        G3.1          Eledrical Installation Condition Report
        The Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) is intended to be issued when a
        periodic inspection of an electrical installation has been carried out. The EICR does not
        certify anything and, hence, must not be issued to certify new electrical installation work.
        The purpose of the EICR is to report on the condition of an existing electrical installation
        and, ultimately, present one of two outcomes:
                II>   SATISFACTORY - the installation is deemed safe for continued use
                II>   UNSATISFACTORY - one or more issues of safety have been identified.
        Where an unsatisfactory result has been recorded, Cl and/or C2 observations will
        have been included identifying the reason(s) for the result. Fl (Further Investigation)
        may also be recorded where the inspection has revealed an apparent deficiency which
        could not, owing to the extent or limitations of the inspection, be fully identified and
        further investigation may reveal a code Cl or C2 observation. Once the report has been
        issued by the inspector, the onus is then placed on the client to act in response to the
        observations recorded.

        G3.2          Observations
        Observations to be recorded fall into four categories:
                ll>   Cl - Danger present. Risk of injury. Immediate remedial action required
                II>   C2 - Potentially dangerous - urgent remedial action required
                II>   C3 - Improvement recommended
                II>   Fl - Further investigation required without delay

                                                                            Appendix                    G
Examples of Cl
Where danger currently exists and an immediate issue of safety is apparent
      Ji>   uninsulated live conductors exposed on broken wiring accessory
      Ji>   incorrect polarity at socket-outlets, e.g. live/cpc reversal
      Ji>   item of metalwork that has become live due to a fault.

Examples of C2
Not immediately dangerous but a dangerous condition could occur due to a fault:
      Ji>   Protective equipotential bonding not installed to extraneous-conductive-parts
      Ji>   RCD (30 mA for additional protection) fails to operate in the required time
      Ji>   double-pole fusing (line and neutral)
      Ji>   no connection to means of earthing at origin
      Ji>   no cpc for lighting ci rcuit having Class I fittings/accessories with exposed-
            conductive-parts
      Ji>   no RCD (30 mA for additional protection) where socket-outlets are likely to
            supply equipment used outdoors.

Examples of C3
Installations complying with older versions of BS 7671:
      Ji>   no RCD ( 30 mA for additional protection) for socket-outlets used within the
            building
      Ji>   earth leakage circuit-breaker installed at origin of n installation
      Ji>   no cpc for lighting circuit where only Class II fittings/accessories are installed.

Examples of Fl
Where further investigation may reveal a code C1 or C2:
      Ji>   a consumer unit is fitted with devices and components of different
            manufacture and may not meet the requirements of BS EN 61439 -3
      Ji>   suspected that devices within a consumer unit are subject to a product recall

G3.3 Dangerous situations
Where the inspector discovers an extremely dangerous situation, e.g. persons or livestock
are at immediate risk of electric shock or an imminent fire hazard is evident, urgent
action is advised to remove the danger. As the expert, the inspector has been employed
to identify electrical problems and, therefore, should make safe such dangerous issues
while on the premises.
The inspector is advised to exercise judgement to secure the area and inform the client
immediately, followed up in writing. Once permission has been obtained, the danger
should be removed.




                                                                                   On-Site Guide        165

G       Appendix
        G3.4 Remedial work
        Often the client will ask how much time they have before any necessary remedial work
        should be carried out once alerted of the unsatisfactory result of the inspection. There is
        no standard answer that can be given as all installations and situations are different from
        each other. It is worth informing the client, however, that the installation has been given
        an unsatisfactory result as there are issues of electrical safety and a duty of care exists
        in law to ensure that employees or members of the public are not placed in a position
        of unacceptable risk.
        When remedial work has been completed in response to the findings of a periodic
        inspection, the work may need to be certified as described in G2.

        G3.5 Periodic inspedion and consumer units in dwellings
        With BS 7671 :2008+A3:2015, the requirement for non-combustible consumer units
        was introduced; see 2.2.6 of this Guide. Inspectors of electrical installations in dwellings
        will encounter older consumer units, i.e. those not complying with 421.1.201, for many
        years to come. To safeguard the ongoing use of such enclosures and assemblies, the
        inspector must ensure the following:
                ..,.. confirmation that ALL conductor connections are correctly located in terminals
                      and are tight and secure; this may involve seeking the advice of the manufacturer
                      of the equipment to establish correct torque settings for screwdrivers when
                      checking terminals. This applies to all terminals conductor/busbar connections
                      within the consumer unit, not just those relating to the addition or alteration
                ..,.. there are no signs of overheating
                ..,.. all covers, shields and barriers supplied when originally installed are present
                      and in a good, serviceable condition
        It must be verified for all conductor/busbar connections:
                      ..,.. not clamping on insulation
                      ..,.. conductor not damaged e.g. through "incision" on a solid conductor during
                            insulation removal, or strands removed
                      ..,.. conductors are correctly placed, for example, on the correct side of a
                            moving plate in a cage-clamp terminal
                      ..,.. permitted number of conductors per terminal is not exceeded
                      ..,.. no undue strain on the electrical connection, particularly incoming tails
        So far as is reasonably practicable, confirm that incorporated components such as a
        Main Switch, circuit-breakers, RCBOs, RCCBs, etc., are not subject of a product recall. This
        could be achieved by direct question to the manufacturer.
        It must not be overlooked that a ferrous enclosure still has the same internal parts and
        connections as a non-ferrous enclosure and, as such, a consumer unit with ferrous
        enclosure should still be inspected and tested at regular intervals.
        It is worth bearing in mind the Note by the Health and Safety Executive in BS 7671 :2018,
        which states:

         Existing installations may have been designed and installed to conform to the standards
         set by earlier editions of 85 7677 or the lEE Wiring Regulations. This does not mean
         that they will fail to achieve conformity with the relevant parts of the Electricity at Work
         Regulations 1989.

        G4.2 Eledrical Installation Certificate - Completion
        Notes for the person producing the Certificate:

                1 The Electrical Installation Certificate is to be used only for the initial certification
                  of a new installation, for an addition or alteration to an existing installation
                  where new circuits have been introduced, or the replacement of a consumer
                  unit/distribution board. It is not to be used for a Periodic Inspection, for which
                  an Electrical Installation Condition Report form should be used. For an addition
                  or alteration which does not extend to the introduction of new circuits, a Minor
                  Electrical Installation Works Certificate may be used.
                   The "original" Certificate is to be issued to the person ordering the work
                  (Regulation 644.4). A duplicate should be retained by the contractor.
                2 This Certificate is only valid if accompanied by the Schedule of Inspections
                  and the Schedule(s) of Test Results.
                3 The signatures appended are those of the persons authorized by the companies
                  executing the work of design, construction, inspection and testing respectively.
                  A signatory authorized to certify more than one category of work should sign in
                  each of the appropriate places.
                4 The time interval recommended before the first periodic inspection must be
                  inserted (see lET Guidance Note 3 for guidance).
                  The proposed date for the next inspection should take into consideration the
                  frequency and quality of maintenance that the installation can reasonably be
                  expected to receive during its intended life, and the period should be agreed
                  between the designer, installer and other relevant parties.
                5 The page numbers for each of the Schedule of Inspections and the Schedule(s)
                  of Test Results should be indicated, together with the total number of sheets
                  involved.
                6 The maximum prospective value of fault current (lpt) recorded should be the
                  greater of either the prospective value of short-circuit current or the prospective
                  value of earth fault current.

        G4.3 Eledrical Installation Certificate - Guidance for
             recipients
        (to be appended to the Certificate)

        This safety Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to
        which it relates has been designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance
        with British Standard 7671 (the lET Wiring Regulations). You should have received an
        "original" Certificate and the contractor should have retained a duplicate. If you were
        the person ordering the work, but not the owner of the installation, you should pass this
        Certificate, or a full copy of it including the schedules, immediately to the owner.
        The "original" Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person
        inspecting or undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you
        later vacate the property, this Certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that the
        electrical installation complied with the requirements of British Standard 7671 at the
        time the Certificate was issued. The Construction (Design and Management) Regulations

2015 require that, for a project covered by those Regulations, a copy of this Certificate,
together with schedules, is included in the project health and safety documentation.
For safety reasons, the electrical installation will need to be inspected at appropriate
intervals by a skilled person or persons competent in such work. The maximum time
interval recommended before the next inspection is stated on Page 1 under "NEXT
INSPECTION".
This Certificate is intended to be issued only for a new electrical installation or for new
work associated with an addition or alteration to an existing installation. It should not
have been issued for the inspection and testing of an existing electrical installation. An
"Electrical Installation Condition Report" should be issued for such an inspection.
This Certificate is only valid if accompanied by the Schedule of Inspections and the
Schedule(s) of Test Results.

Ci4.4        Schedule of Test Results
Notes to the tests and observations required when completing the Schedule of Test
Results:
      Ill>   Measurement of Z5 at this distribution board to be recorded
      Ill>   Measurement of lpt at this distribution board to be recorded
      Ill>   Confirm correct polarity of supply to this distribution board by the use of
             approved test instrument
      Ill>   Confirmation of phase sequence for multi-phase installations
      Ill>   Identify circuits with equipment which could be damaged if connected when
             tests are carried out, e.g. SELV transformers, dimming equipment.

(see also 10.2):
A - Installation isolated from the supply

1            Continuity
             Radial conductors
                                                                                           •
             Continuity of protective           conductors,           including          mam          and
             supplementary bonding
             Every protective conductor, including main and supplementary bonding
             conductors, should be tested to verify that it is continuous and correctly
             connected.
             Test method 1
             Where test method 1 is used, enter the measured resistance of the line
             conductor plus the circuit protective conductor (R 1 + R:2). See 10.3.1. During
             the continuity testing (test method 1) the following polarity checks should be
             carried out:

                 (a) overcurrent devices and single-pole controls are in the line conductor,
                 (b) except for E14 and E27 lampholders to BS EN 60238, centre contact screw
                     lampholders have the outer threaded contact connected to the neutral, and
                 (c) socket-outlet polarities are correct.
               Compliance for each circuit is indicated by a tick in polarity column 17.
                (R 1 + R2) need not be recorded if R2 is recorded in column 14.
               Test method 2

               Where test method 2 is used, the maximum value of R2 is recorded in column 14.
               Ring final circuit continuity

                Each conductor of the ring final circuit must be tested for continuity, including
                spurs. An exception is permitted where the cpc is formed by, e.g. metallic conduit
                or trunking and is not in the form of a ring. N/A can be recorded here but continuity
                of the cpc will be confirmed in either column 13 or 14.
        2       Insulation resistance

               All voltage sensitive devices to be disconnected or test between live conductors
               (line and neutral) connected together and earth.
               The insulation resistance between live conductors (line-to-line and line-to-neutral
               for three-phase installations and line-to-neutral for single-phase installations) is
               inserted in column 15 and between live conductors and earth in column 16.
               The minimum insulation resistance values are given in Table 10.3.3 of this Guide.
        3       Polarity - by continuity method

                A satisfactory polarity test may be indicated by a tick in column 17. Only in a
                Schedule of Test Results associated with an Electrical Installation Condition Report
                is it acceptable to record incorrect polarity.
        B- Installation energised
        4       Polarity of supply

               The polarity of the supply at the distribution board should be confirmed and
               indicated by ticking the box on the Schedule of Test Results.
        5       Earth fault loop impedance Z5

               This may be determined either by direct measurement at the furthest point of
               a live circuit or by adding (R 1 + R2) of column 13 to Ze· Ze is determined by
               measurement at the origin of the installation.

                Z5 = Ze + (R1 + R0
                Z5 should not exceed the values given in Appendix B.

6    Functional testing
    The operation of RCDs (including RCBOs) is tested by simulating a fault condition,
    independent of any test facility in the device; see Section 11.
    When testing an RCD at 160, record the operating time in column 19.
    RCDs are tested in relation to their function:
            •   RCDs rated at 30 rnA or less are used to provide additional protection,
                these devices are to be tested at 5 160
             • RCDs rated at 100 rnA or higher where used to provide fault protection
                or fire protection, these devices are to be tested at 160
    with the operating time recorded in column 22.
    Effectiveness of the test button must be confirmed and the result recorded in
    column 21.
7    Switchgear
    All switchgear and controlgear assemblies, controls, etc. must be operated to
    ensure that they are properly mounted, adjusted and installed.
8    Earth electrode resistance
    The resistance of earth electrodes must be measured. For reliability in service the
    resistance of any earth electrode should be below 200 0. Record the value on
    Form 1, 2 or 6, as appropriate.

C4.6 Minor Eledrical Installation Works Certificate -
          Scope of application
Notes for the person producing the certificate: The Minor Electrical Installation
Works Certificate is intended to be used for additions and alterations to an installation
that do not extend to the provision of a new circuit. Examples include the addition of
socket-outlets or lighting points to an existing circuit, the relocation of a light switch etc.
This Certificate may also be used for the replacement of equipment such as accessories
or luminaires, but not for the replacement of distribution boards or similar items.
Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be carried out irrespective
of the extent of the work undertaken.

C4. 7     Minor Eledrical Installation Works Certificate -
          Guidance for recipients
(to be appended to the Certificate)

This Certificate has been issued to confirm that the electrical installation work to which it
relates has been designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with British
Standard 7671 (the lET Wiring Regulations).
You should have received an "original" Certificate and the contractor should have
retained a duplicate. If you were the person ordering the work, but not the owner of
the installation, you should pass this Certificate, or a copy of it, to the owner. A separate
Certificate should have been received for each existing circuit on which minor works
have been carried out. This Certificate is not appropriate if you requested the contractor
to undertake more extensive installation work, for which you should have received an
Electrical Installation Certificate.
The Certificate should be retained in a safe place and be shown to any person inspecting
or undertaking further work on the electrical installation in the future. If you later vacate
the property, this Certificate will demonstrate to the new owner that the minor electrical
installation work carried out complied with the requirements of BS 7671 at the time the
Certificate was issued.

C4.9 Eledrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)
Installations may be divided into two types:
      Ji>   Domestic and similar installations with up to 100 A single- or three-phase
            supply
      Ji>   Installations with a supply greater than 100 A.
However, this Guide will only consider the Electrical Installation Condition Report for
Domestic and similar installations with up to 100 A supply. For installations with a supply
greater than 100 A, see lET Guidance Note 3.
For domestic and similar installations with up to 100 A supply, the inspector will be
required to complete a minimum of five pages of information for an EICR.
An Electrical Installation Condition Report (Form 6) is to be issued for all
inspected installations.

Figures G4.9(i)- (v) show a typical completed Electrical Installation Condition Report
comprising Forms 6, 7 and 4. The installation is some 20 years old and has no RCD
fitted.

Hl        Introduction
This appendix gives advice on standard circuit arrangements for household and similar
premises. The circuits provide guidance on the requirements of Chapter 43 for overload
protection and Section 537 of BS 7671 for isolation and switching. Reference must also
be made to Section 7 and Table 7.1(i) for cable csa, length and installation reference
method.

It is t he responsibility of the designer and installer when adopting these circuit
arrangements to take the appropriate measures to comply with the requirements of
other chapters or sections which are relevant, such as Chapter 41 'Protection against
electric shock', Chapter 54 'Earthing arrangements and protective conductors' and
Chapter 52 'Selection and erection of wiring systems'.

Circuit arrangements other than t hose detailed in this appendix are not precluded when
specified by a competent person, in accordance w ith the general requirements of
Regulation 314.3.


Hl        Final circuits using socket-outlets complying
          with BS 1363-2 and fused connection units
          complying with BS 1363-4
Hl.l      General
In this arrangement, a ring or radial circuit, with spurs if any, feeds permanently connected
equipment and a number of socket-outlets and fused connection units.

The floor area served by the circuit is determined by the known or estimated load and
should not exceed the value given in Table H2.1.

433.1.204     A single 30 A or 32 A ring circuit may serve a floor area of up to 100 m2 . Socket-
              outlets for washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers should be located so as
              to provide reasonable sharing of the load in each leg of the ring, or consideration should
              be given to separate circuits.

  553.1.7     The number of socket-outlets provided should be such that all equipment can be
              supplied from an adjacent accessible socket-outlet, taking account of the length of flex
              normally fitted to portable appliances and luminaires. See H7.
              Diversity between socket-outlets and permanently connected equipment has already
              been taken into account in Table H2.1 and no further diversity should be applied, see
              Appendix A of this Guide.

H2.3 Condudor size
The minimum size of conductor cross-sectional area in the circuit and in non-fused spurs
is given in Table H2.1, however, the actual size of cable is determined by the current-
carrying capacity for the particular method of installation, after applying appropriate
rating factors from Appendix F, see Table 7.1 (i). The as-installed current-carrying capacity
(lz) so calculated must be not less than:
      ..,. 20 A for ring circuit A1
      ..,. 30 A or 32 A for radial circuit A2 (i.e. the rating of the overcurrent protective
           device)
      ..,. 20 A for radial circuit A3 (i.e. the rating of the overcurrent protective device).
The conductor size for a fused spur is determined from the total current demand served
by that spur, which is limited to a maximum of 13 A.
Where a fused spur serves socket-outlets the minimum conductor size is:
                  2
      ..,. 1.5 mm for cables with thermosetting or thermoplastic (PVC) insulated cables,
           copper conductors
                2
      ..,. 1 mm for mineral insulated cables, copper conductors.
The conductor size for circuits protected by BS 3036 fuses is determined by applying
the 0.725 factor of Regulation 433.1.202, that is the current-carrying capacity must be at
least 27 A for circuits A1 and A3, 41 A for circuit A2.

H2.4 Spurs
The total number of fused spurs is unlimited but the number of non-fused spurs should
not exceed the total number of socket-outlets and items of stationary equipment
connected directly in the circuit.
In an A1 ring final circuit and an A2 radial circuit of Table H2.1 a non-fused spur should
feed only one single or one twin or multiple socket-outlet or one item of permanently
connected equipment. Such a spur should be connected to the circuit at the terminals
of a socket-outlet or junction box, or at the origin of the circuit in the distribution board.
A fused spur should be connected to the circuit through a fused connection unit, the
rating of the fuse in the unit not exceeding that of the cable forming the spur and, in any
event, not exceed ing 13 A.

H2.5 Permanently conneded equipment
Permanently connected equipment should be locally protected by a fuse complying with
BS 1362 of rating not exceeding 13 A or by a circuit-breaker of rating not exceeding 16 A
and should be controlled by a switch, where needed (see Appendix J). A separate switch
is not required if the circuit-breaker is to be used as a switch.

        H3.1          General
        Where a radial circuit feeds equipment the maximum demand of which, having allowed
        for diversity, is known or estimated not to exceed the rating of the overcurrent protective
        device and in any event does not exceed 20 A, the number of socket-outlets is unlimited.

        H3.l Circuit protedion
        The overcurrent protective device shou ld have a rating not exceeding 20 A.

        H3.3 Condudor size
        The minimum size of conductor in the circuit is given in Tables H2.1 and 7.1 (i). Where
        cables are grouped together the limitations of 7.2.1 and Appendix F apply.

        H3.4 Types of socket-outlet
        Socket-outlets should have a rated current of 16 A and be of the type appropriate
        to the number of phases, circuit voltage and earthing arrangements. Socket-outlets
        incorporating pilot contacts are not included.

                         •
                     premases
        The circuit supplies a control switch or a cooker unit complying with BS 4177, which may
        incorporate a socket-outlet.
        The rating of the circuit is determined by the assessment of the current demand of the
        cooking appliance(s), and cooker control unit socket-outlet if any, in accordance with
        Table A1 of Appendix A. A 30 or 32 A circuit is usually appropriate for household or
        similar cookers of rating up to 15 kW.
        A circu it of rating exceeding 15 A but not exceeding 50 A may supply two or more
        cooking appliances where these are installed in one room. The control switch or cooker
        control unit should be placed within 2 m of the appliance, but not directly above it.
        Where two stationary cooking appliances are installed in one room, one switch may be
        used to control both appliances provided that neither appliance is more than 2 m from
        the switch. Attention is drawn to the need to provide selective (discriminative) operation
        of protective devices as stated in Regulation 536.3.

553.1.6   The Building Regulations of England and Wales and of Scotland require switches and
          socket-outlets in new dwellings to be installed so that all persons including those whose
          reach is limited can easily use them. A way of satisfying the requirement is to install
          switches, socket-outlets and controls throughout the dwelling in accessible positions
          at a height of between 450 mm and 1200 mm from the finished floor level - see
          Figure H6. Because of the sensitivity of circuit-breakers, RCCBs and RCBOs fitted in
          consumer units, consumer units should be readily accessible.
          (In areas subject to flooding, meters, cut-outs and consumer units should preferably be
          fixed above flood water level.)

            H7           Number of socket-outlets
553.1.7     Sufficient socket-outlets are required to be installed so that all equipment likely to
            be used can be supplied from a reasonably accessible socket-outlet, taking account
            of the length of flexible cable normally fitted to portable appliances and luminaires.
            Table H7 provides guidance on the number of socket-outlets that are likely to meet this
            requirement.
            In Scotland, mandatory standard 4.6 requires that every building must be designed and
            constructed in such a way that electric lighting points and socket-outlets are provided
            to ensure the health, safety and convenience of occupants and visitors. The Building
            Standards Division of the Scottish Government make recommendations for the number
            of socket-outlets that should be installed in a domestic premises in section 4.6.4 of the
            domestic technical handbook as follows:
                     ~kitchen- 6 (at least 3 above worktop height)
                    ~ other habitable rooms - 4
                    ~ plus at least 4 more throughout the property including at least one per
                      circulation area per storey.
            The socket-outlets may be either single or double.

Notes to Table H7:

1   KITCHEN - If a socket-outlet is provided in the cooker control unit, this should not be included in the
    6 recommended in the table above. Appliances built into kitchen furniture (integrated appliances)
    should be connected to a socket-outlet or switch fused connection unit that is accessible when
    the appliance is in place and in normal use. Alternatively, where an appliance is supplied from a
    socket-outlet or a connection unit, these should be controlled by an accessible double pole switch or
    switched fused connection unit. It is recommended that wall mounted socket-outlets above a work
    surface are spaced at not more than 1 metre intervals along the surface.
2   HOME ENTERTAINMENT - In addition to the number of socket-outlets shown in the table it is
    recommended that at least two further double socket-outlets are installed in home entertainment
    areas.
3   LOCATIONS CONTAINING A BATH OR SHOWER - Socket-outlets other than SELV socket-outlets
    and shaver supply units complying with BS EN 61558-2-5 are prohibited within a distance of 3 m
    horizontally from the boundary of zone 1 e.g. 230 V socket-outlets in a bathroom must be installed a
    minimum 3 m from the edge of the bath, BS 7671 (lET Wiring Regulations) refers.
4   ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING - Electric vehicle charging should be from a single socket-outlet via a
    dedicated circuit provided for the connection to electric vehicles. This dedicated circuit must conform
    to the relevant requirements in BS 767 1 section 722 "Electric Vehicle Charging Installations", which
    includes the specification of socket-outlets and connectors for the charging point. See also lET Code
    of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installation.


HI         LED lighting
Installers will quite correctly select and install energy efficient lighting to comply with
Part L of the Building Regulations, to improve the efficiency of the installation and to
minimise energy costs to the client.
Incandescent lighting was commonly replaced by Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)
and these in turn are being replaced by Light Emitting Diodes (LED) lamps. The
advantage of LED lamps over CFL lamps is they do not require a warm-up period to
enable full brightness and they are generally more efficient in terms of lumens per watt.
In addition to efficiency, LED lamps are available in various colour temperatures for
different applications and client preference.
Manufacturers of LED lamps will claim a product life of up to 25,000 hours depending
on the manufacturer and model range. Generally, the cost of the lamp will dictate
performance and life expecta ncy. LED lamps are produced for every type of lampholder,
application and are available for both mains voltages and extra-low voltage (ELV). Lamps
for use on mains voltages will have a small power supply built into the individual lamp
base whilst ELV lamps will be supplied from a separate lamp driver power supply. When
selecting lamps and drivers where dimming is required, it is important to select types
that are specified as dimmable by the manufacturer.
Although manufacturers and suppliers are claiming very long life for their LEOs and
drivers, contractors are reporting very early failures and much shorter product life.
Installers should carefully read the manufacturer's product sheet to ensure that they are
installed in accordance with the manufacturer's specification. Designers and installers
are required to comply with BS 7671 Regulation 134.1.1 which states, "The installation
of electrical equipment shall take account of manufacturers' instructionsH




                                                                                       On-Site Guide       193

H       Appendix
        One reason for early failure is when drivers and recessed downlighters are installed in
        ceilings and are covered with, or touching, thermal or acoustic insulation. This may cause
        the driver or lamp to overheat, which leads to early failure. Insulation should be kept clear
        of drivers and lamps and installers should consider using proprietary displacement boxes
        to achieve this separation.
        Another reason for early failure of drivers and LED lamps is that they are not suitable
        for the supply voltage prevailing on the installation. Many manufacturers will specify a
        maximum operating voltage of 230 V or 240 V but Appendix 2 of BS 7671:2018 shows
        nominal voltage of 230 V with permitted tolerances of+ 10 %I -6 %, meaning that the
        supply voltage at the incoming terminals of an electrical supply provided in accordance
        with ESQCR can be between the limits of 216.2- 253.0 volts.

          Fault current I = Uo/Z5

          where:

           U0       is the nominal voltage to earth
           Zs       is the earth fault loop impedance
          and

          Z5 = Ze + (R 1 + R~
          where:

           Ze       is that part of the earth fault loop impedance external to the circuit concerned
           R1       is the resistance of the line conductor from the origin of the circuit to the point
                    of utilization
                    is the resistance of the protective conductor from the origin of the circuit to the
                    point of utilization.

          Similarly, in order to design circuits for compliance with BS 7671 limiting values of earth
          fault loop impedance given in Tables 41.2 to 41.4, it is necessary to establish the relevant
          impedances of the circuit conductors concerned at their operating temperature.
          Table 11 gives values of (R 1 + R~ per metre for various combinations of conductors up to
                                 2
          and including 35 mm cross-sectional area. It also gives values of resistance (milliohms)
          per metre for each size of conductor. These values are at 20 oc.

               *      The correction factor is given by {1 + 0.004(ambient temp - 20 oc)} where 0.004
                      is the simplified resistance coefficient per oc at 20 oc given by BS EN 60228 for
                      copper and aluminium conductors.


               Verification
               For verification purposes the designer will need to give the values of the line and circuit
               protective conductor resistances at the ambient temperature expected during the tests.
               This may be different from the reference temperature of 20 oc used for Table 11. The
               rating factors in Table 12 may be applied to the values to take account of the ambient
               temperature (for test purposes only).


               Multipliers for conductor operating temperature
Table 41 . 2   Table 13 gives the multipliers to be applied to the values given in Table 11 for the purpose
Table 41.3     of calculating the resistance at maximum operating temperature of the line conductors
               and/or circuit protective conductors in order to determine compliance with, as applicable,
               the earth fault loop impedance of Table 41.2, Table 41.3 or Table 41.4 of BS 7671.
Table 41 .4    Where it is known that the actual operating temperature under normal load is less than
               the maximum permissible value for the type of cable insulation concerned (as given in
               the tables of current-carrying capacity) the multipliers given in Table 13 may be reduced
               accordingly.

                     bunched with cables.
              3      The multipliers given in Table 13 for both copper and aluminium conductors are based on a
                     simplification of the formula given in BS EN 60228, namely that the resistance- temperature
                     coefficient is 0.004 per oc at 20 oc.

      Ill> HD 308 S2:2001 Identification of cores in cables and flexible cords
      Ill> BS EN 60445:2017 Basic and safety principles for man- machine interface,
             marking and identification of equipment and terminals and of terminations

This appendix provides guidance on marking at the interface between old and harmonized
colours, and general guidance on the colours to be used for conductors.
British Standards for fixed and flexible cables have been harmonized (see Table K1).
BS 7671 has been modified to align with these cables but also allows other suitable
methods of marking connections by colours, e.g. tapes, sleeves or discs, or by
alphanumerics, i.e. letters and/or numbers. Methods may be mixed within an installation.
