# Elec-Mate — Full Product Documentation for AI

> The complete digital platform for UK electricians. Training, AI tools, certificates, calculators, and business management.

## Product Overview

Elec-Mate is the most comprehensive app available for UK electrical professionals. Unlike competitors that focus on a single feature (iCertifi for certificates, or generic calculator apps), Elec-Mate combines every tool an electrician needs into one platform. It is mobile-first, built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), and designed for use on job sites.

Founded in the UK, Elec-Mate serves qualified electricians, electrical apprentices, electrical employers, and college tutors. It is the only platform that combines AI-powered tools trained specifically on BS 7671 with digital certification, 50+ calculators, full apprentice training courses, and business management.
