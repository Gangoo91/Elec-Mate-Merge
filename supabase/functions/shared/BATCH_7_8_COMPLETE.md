# BS 7671 Knowledge Extraction - Batches 7 & 8 COMPLETE ✅

## Files Created:

### 1. `bs7671Certification.ts`
**Appendix 6: Model Forms for Certification and Reporting**

- ✅ Electrical Installation Certificate (EIC) - Reg 644.1, 644.4
- ✅ Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate (MEIWC) - Reg 644.4.201
- ✅ Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) - Reg 653.1
- ✅ EICR Observation Codes (C1, C2, C3, FI) with examples
- ✅ Complete Schedule of Inspections (10 major categories, 20+ items)
- ✅ 10-Step Test Sequence (Reg 643) with acceptance criteria
- ✅ Certification validity conditions and requirements
- ✅ Utility functions: `getCertificateRequirements`, `getCriticalInspectionItems`, `validateEICRObservation`

## Knowledge Now Available to Agents:

### Designer Agent:
- Understand certification requirements for projects
- Know what must be documented for compliance
- Design with testability in mind (Zs, insulation, polarity)
- Ensure SPD, RCD, AFDD requirements documented

### Installer Agent:
- Complete Schedule of Inspections checklist
- Know critical inspection items (earthing, bonding, RCD protection)
- Understand certification sign-off responsibilities
- Guidance on what installer must verify

### Commissioning Agent:
- **10-Step Test Sequence (Reg 643)** in correct order:
  1. Continuity of protective conductors (R1+R2)
  2. Ring final circuit continuity
  3. Insulation resistance (≥1MΩ for LV)
  4. SELV/PELV/electrical separation (if applicable)
  5. Floor/wall insulation (non-conducting locations - rare)
  6. Polarity (critical safety)
  7. Earth fault loop impedance (Zs ≤ max values)
  8. RCD testing (×1, ×5 rated current)
  9. Prospective fault current (Ipf)
  10. Functional testing (switches, RCDs, etc.)
- Acceptance criteria for each test
- EICR observation coding (C1=Danger, C2=Urgent, C3=Improvement, FI=Investigate)
- Certificate completion requirements

## Critical Certification Knowledge Embedded:

🚨 **EIC vs MEIWC vs EICR**:
- **EIC**: New installation, new circuits, consumer unit replacement
- **MEIWC**: Minor works (add sockets, relocate switch) - NO new circuits
- **EICR**: Periodic inspection of existing installation

🚨 **EICR Observation Codes** (CRITICAL FOR SAFETY):
- **C1 (Danger Present)**: IMMEDIATE action required
  - Examples: Live parts accessible, no RCD protection, damaged cables
- **C2 (Potentially Dangerous)**: URGENT action required
  - Examples: Inadequate bonding, overloaded circuits, Zs exceeded
- **C3 (Improvement Recommended)**: Not dangerous but should be improved
  - Examples: Lack of SPD (pre-2019), no AFDD, older wiring colours
- **FI (Further Investigation)**: Cannot verify - needs investigation
  - Examples: Unable to access concealed wiring, unknown earth electrode resistance

🚨 **Test Sequence Order MUST be followed** (Reg 643):
- Tests 1-6 performed with supply OFF (dead testing)
- Tests 7-10 performed with supply ON (live testing)
- Incorrect sequence = invalid certification

## Batch Completion Status:

✅ **Batch 1**: Appendix 4 (Cable Tables, Correction Factors)
✅ **Batch 2**: Special Locations (Bathrooms, Outdoor) + Testing
✅ **Batch 3**: Chapter 52 (Installation Methods, Safe Zones)
✅ **Batch 4**: Chapter 54 (Earthing & Bonding, CPC Sizing)
✅ **Batch 5**: Extended Special Locations (Pools, Construction, Caravans)
✅ **Batch 6**: Chapter 53 (SPDs, Isolation, Switching)
✅ **Batch 7**: Appendix 3 (Time/Current - covered in existing test data)
✅ **Batch 8**: Appendix 6 (Certification Templates) ← NEW!
