# BS 7671 Knowledge Extraction - Batch 6 COMPLETE ✅

## Files Created:

### 1. `bs7671IsolationSwitching.ts`
**Chapter 53: Protection, Isolation, Switching and Control**

- ✅ Isolation requirements (Reg 537.2) - Every installation must be isolatable
- ✅ Switching for mechanical maintenance (Reg 537.3) - Switch-disconnectors, lockable
- ✅ Emergency switching/stopping (Reg 537.4) - RED emergency stop requirements
- ✅ **Surge Protective Devices (SPDs) - Reg 534** - CRITICAL for all installations from 2019
- ✅ Functional switching (Reg 537.5) - Normal operational control
- ✅ SPD installation guidelines - Cable length <0.5m, earthing <0.1Ω
- ✅ Utility functions: `getSPDRequirementForInstallation`, `getIsolationRequirement`, `validateSPDInstallation`

## Knowledge Now Available to Agents:

### Designer Agent:
- Specify SPD requirements (Type 1/2/3) based on installation type
- Calculate SPD protection levels (Up values)
- Determine isolation device requirements for circuits
- Emergency switching specifications for machinery

### Installer Agent:
- SPD installation procedure (connecting cable <0.5m, earthing path)
- Isolation device positioning and lockability requirements
- Emergency stop button placement and colour coding (RED on YELLOW)
- Switching device selection for different applications

### Commissioning Agent:
- Verify SPD installation (cable length, earthing impedance)
- Test isolation devices (all poles disconnect, lockable)
- Check emergency stop functionality (manual reset required)
- Validate functional switching ratings

## Critical Safety Knowledge Embedded:

🚨 **SPD Requirements (Reg 534.4.4.1)** - MANDATORY from Jan 2019:
- All new residential installations require Type 2 SPD minimum
- Commercial/industrial with >10m earthing system: Type 1 + Type 2 cascade
- Sensitive equipment: Type 2 + Type 3 at equipment

🚨 **Isolation Requirements**:
- Must isolate ALL live conductors (L+N in single-phase)
- Lockable in OFF position for maintenance
- Clearly identified and readily accessible

🚨 **Emergency Stopping**:
- RED actuator on YELLOW background
- Manual reset required (cannot auto-restart)
- Direct breaking of supply
