## POST 1: THE BIG REVEAL (Main Post)

**Elec-Mate Apprentice Hub — Everything You Need. One App. Completely Free.**

We built the Apprentice Hub for one reason: because apprentice electricians deserve better than scattered PDFs, outdated textbooks, and guesswork.

This is the most complete digital training platform ever built for UK electrical apprentices — and every feature is free.

Here's what's inside. Buckle up, because this is a big one...

---

### YOUR PERSONAL DASHBOARD

The moment you open the Apprentice Hub, it knows you. A personalised greeting. Your apprentice year badge. Your study streak with a flame icon that grows the more consecutive days you study.

Four tappable stat cards track everything at a glance — your study streak, overall progress percentage, videos watched out of 60, and diary entries logged. Tap any card to see the full breakdown.

Below that, quick-launch cards take you straight to the Study Centre (2,000+ questions, AM2 Prep), Inspection & Testing (8 topics, exam ready), your Portfolio (evidence mapping, OJT hours), EPA Readiness (AI-scored mock professional discussions), and AM2 Readiness (interactive safe isolation, fault finding, and testing simulations).

You'll also find three personalised video recommendations based on your apprentice year, plus a Tools & Resources grid giving you one-tap access to the AI Study Assistant, Site Diary, Calculators, On-Job Tools, Mental Health Hub, and Career Development.

And your Elec-ID banner? That's your FREE digital professional identity — scannable by any employer or assessor.

### 2. EPA SIMULATOR — AI-Powered End Point Assessment Practice

The End Point Assessment is the final hurdle of your apprenticeship. Most apprentices go in having never practised it. That changes now.

**Readiness Tab** — A radial progress ring scores you from 0 to 100 on EPA readiness. Colour-coded status tells you if you're Ready, Nearly Ready, Needs Work, or Not Ready. Four component scores break it down: Portfolio quality, Evidence Quality, Mock Discussion performance, and Mock Knowledge scores. A gateway status banner shows whether you're On Track or At Risk, and gap analysis pinpoints exactly what needs work.

**Professional Discussion** — Select one of your actual portfolio entries as the discussion topic. The AI generates questions based on your real evidence — not generic prompts. Record your answer with voice (speech-to-text) or type it manually. Get real-time feedback as you speak. When you finish, see your predicted EPA grade (Distinction, Pass, or Fail), a breakdown by Knowledge, Application, and Communication percentages, and time taken. Retake as many times as you like until you're confident.

**Knowledge Test** — Multiple-choice and short-answer questions with real-time scoring. Results show correct answers with full explanations so you learn from every question.

**History** — Every past session saved with scores, grades, dates, and time spent. Tap any session to review details or retake it.

---

### 3. AM2 SIMULATOR — Full Practical Assessment Practice

The AM2 is the practical exam that stands between you and your JIB Gold Card. We've built a complete digital practice environment.

**Readiness Dashboard** — A radial gauge shows your overall readiness score. Risk level is colour-coded: red for High, amber for Moderate, green for Low. Four component scores cover Safe Isolation, Testing Sequence, Fault Diagnosis, and Knowledge. Gap analysis tells you where to focus.

**Safe Isolation Assessment** — An interactive step-by-step safe isolation procedure. Every step is scored as correct, incorrect, or partial. Visual circuit diagrams show you what you're working on. Clear Pass or Fail result at the end.

**Testing Simulator** — This is full-screen and immersive. A physical MFT instrument interface with rotary dial selector, LCD display, test buttons for Continuity, Insulation Resistance, Loop Impedance, and RCD testing, plus probe connectors. A virtual circuit diagram shows test points to probe. You get expected versus actual readings feedback, a session summary with tests performed, correct sequence percentage, and pass or fail outcome. And here's the clever bit — it auto-fills an EIC certificate from your test results, so you practise the paperwork too.

**Fault Finding Simulator** — A circuit with a deliberate fault: open circuit, short circuit, or wrong polarity. A digital multimeter interface with display, range selector, and probe inputs. Probe different points, get visual feedback, identify the fault type, location, and cause. Scored on time taken and methodology — just like the real assessment.

Plus Knowledge Quiz and History tabs to track your progress over time.

---

### 4. PORTFOLIO HUB — Your Complete Digital Apprenticeship Portfolio

The Capture Sheet lets you take or upload a photo, record video, link a file, type a description, and auto-map everything to assessment criteria.

**Hours** — OJT hours logged versus required, weekly breakdown, and compliance warnings so you never fall behind on your 20% off-the-job training.

**Progress** — Overall completion percentage, per-unit breakdown, and an assessment criteria coverage map showing exactly what's covered and what's missing.

**Me** — Your profile card, achievement badges, and a share link so your employer or assessor can view your portfolio online.

### WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT?

**It's built by people who understand the trade.** Not a generic learning platform with "electrical" slapped on it. Every question, every scenario, every piece of content is specific to UK electrical apprenticeships, BS 7671, and the qualifications you're actually working towards.

**It's mobile-first.** Built for your phone, because that's what you've got on site. Big touch targets, fast loading, works offline where it matters.

**It saves your progress everywhere.** Auto-save means you never lose your place. Start a quiz on the bus, finish it at home. Your streak, your scores, your portfolio — all synced.

**It takes mental health seriously.** The construction industry has the highest suicide rate of any sector in the UK. The Mental Health Hub isn't an afterthought. It's a core feature with AI support, peer connections, and immediate crisis resources.

**It's completely free.** No premium tier. No paywall. No "subscribe to unlock". Everything listed above is available to every apprentice who signs up.
